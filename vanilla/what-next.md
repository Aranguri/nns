#suggestions
do feature-testing in other sessions than when I'm coding features

#technical
try cross entropy function
learning_rate decay
conv nets
rnn
lstms
rl (do with rl what I did with backprop)
use evolution for the structure

#g√ºi
why gpus is faster? use gcloud
make a layer on top of nn to try different hyperparams
create fast mode and verbose mode

#tasks
make a summary
download hacker news and categorize by user

#conv nn
think: what does the convolution operation mean?
use a separation of 8 instead of 1
change word structure (ie don't use the same string to bits function, the ascii thing)
try this structure
[
    ('conv', 6 * 8),
    ('pool', 5),
    ('conv', 8),
    ('pool', 5),
    ('conv', 8),
    ('pool', 5),
]

#neighbors
try kmeans with features of words
