Meditations, VII, 2r
Marcus Aurelius was wrong. Eighteen centuries-almost two millennia-have
passed, and the Meditations are still alive. Nor have their pages
been reserved to a few aristocrats of the intellect, like Shaftesbury,
Frederick II, or Goethe: on the contrary, for centuries they have brought
reasons to live to innumerable unknown people, who have been able to
read them in the multiple translations of the Meditations which have been
made in every corner of the earth; and they still do so today.
The Meditations are an inexhaustible source of wisdom; an "eternal
Gospel," in Renan's words. Apparently, the Meditations do not hold any
particular difficulties in store for their readers. Aphorisms and brief dissertations
follow one another without any apparent order, and as the
reader leafs through the book, he or she winds up finding a striking or
moving formula which seems to speak by itself, and to need no exegesis.
It is not a book to be read in one sitting. One must return to it often, in
order to discover in it, day by day, some nourishment which suits the
momentary states of our soul. The modern reader can perfectly well
understand a given aphorism by Marcus Aurelius, like the one I have
quoted as an epigraph. This is what is always attractive about the Meditations:
their sayings, whose limpidity can never grow old.
And yet, what a deceptive limpidity! For besides these formulas, there
are others which are much more obscure, and which have been understood
by historians in widely varying ways. The overall meaning of the
book, its purpose, and some of its affirmations are very hard for us to
grasp. Nor is this the case only with Marcus Aurelius. For all kinds of
reasons, of which chronological distance is not the most important, our
understanding of ancient works has grown more and more dim. To gain
access to them once more, we will have to practice a kind of spiritual
Vlll Preface
exercise or intellectual ascetics, in order to free ourselves from certain
prejudices and rediscover what is, for us, almost another way of thinking.
This is what we shall attempt to do throughout the present work. Before
we set out upon this itinerary, however, it may be helpful to become
aware of these prejudices and illusions, which threatep to cause the
modern reader to go astray when reading a work from antiquity.
In the first place, the reader will perhaps imagine that the text has
remained constant since the distant era in which it appeared, as do our
contemporary printed texts. But we must not forget that ancient texts
were, precisely, not printed: for centuries they were copied by hand, and
copying errors were thereby constantly introduced. We can hardly blame
the ancient scribes for this, if we think of our modern books, which,
although they are printed, are often filled with printer's errors, which
sometimes deform the author's thought to the point of rendering it
unintelligible. That, however, is another question. It cannot be overemphasized
that it is thanks to the efforts of the scholars who investigate and
classify the manuscripts in which ancient works have been preserved, and
who attempt, using the critical method of the classification of errors, to
reconstitute the original state of the text, that we can now read the works
of antiquity in a state which is more or less satisfactory, but can never be
perfect. I feel I must insist upon this point, which is sometimes completely
ignored by some scientific authorities or historians of philosophy,
who imagine that one can hold forth about the theories of a particular
ancient author without knowing what he really wrote. In the case of
Marcus Aurelius, the greatest uncertainty often reigns with regard to
certain words of his text. This does not affect the totality of the work, but
it nevertheless remains true that some passages present almost insurmountable
difficulties, and we should not be surprised if these difficulties
are reflected in the translations which have been made of this author.
The modern reader tends too often to imagine that there is only one
possible translation of a Greek text, and he or she may be surprised to
find considerable differences. This fact should, however, make the reader
aware of the distance that separates us from the ancients. Translation
presupposes, first of all, a choice with regard to the Greek text, in those
cases in which this text is sometimes uncertain. But the translators' hesitations
often also correspond to the difficulties they have in understanding
the text, and to the sometimes radically different interpretations
of it which they propose. In the case of Marcus Aurelius, for example,
many have not been able to render in an exact manner the technical
terms, peculiar to the Stoic system, which are found on every page of the
Preface lX
Meditations. Moreover, in the case of Marcus, the division of the text into
chapters is very uncertain, and often the limits of each "meditation" are
not absolutely clear. Thus, the very appearance of the text can vary
widely.
Finally, the modem reader might imagine-and no one is safe from
this error-that the ancient author lives in the same intellectual world as
he does. The reader will treat the author's affirmations exactly as if they
came from a contemporary author, and will therefore think he has immediately
understood what the author meant. In fact, however, this
understanding will be anachronistic, and the reader will often run the risk
of committing serious mistranslations. To be sure, it is fashionable nowadays
to affirm that, in any case, we cannot know exactly what an author
meant, and that, moreover, this does not matter at all, for we can give the
works any meaning we please. For my part, and without entering into
this debate, I would say that before we discover "unintentional" meanings,
it seems to me both possible and necessary to discover the meaning
which the author intended. It is absolutely indispensable to go in the
direction of a basic meaning, to which we can then refer in order to
uncover, if we should so wish, those meanings of which the author was
perhaps not conscious. It is true, however, that this reconstitution is
extremely difficult for us, because we project attitudes and intentions
proper to our era into the past. I� order to understand ancient works, we
must relocate them within their context, in the widest sense of the term,
which can signify the material, social, and political situation as well as the
political and rhetorical universe of thought. In particular, we must recall
that the mechanisms of literary composition were very different then
from what they are now. In antiquity, the rules of discourse were rigorously
codified. In order to say what he wanted to say, an author had to
say it in a specific way, in accordance with traditional models, and according
to rules prescribed by rhetoric or philosophy. Marcus Aurelius'
Meditations, for instance, are not the spontaneous outpourings of a soul
that wants to express its thoughts immediately, but rather an exercise,
accomplished in accordance with definite rules. As we shall see, they
presuppose a pre-existing canvas, upon which the philosopher-emperor
could only embroider. Often, Marcus says certain things only because he
has to say them, by virtue of the models and precepts imposed upon him.
The meaning of the Meditations can, therefore, only be understood once
we have discovered, among other things, the prefabricated schemes
which have been imposed upon it.
My intention, which is to offer the modem reader an introduction to
x Preface
the reading of the Meditations, will thus perhaps not be without usefulness.
I will try to discover what Marcus wanted to accomplish by writing
them, to specify the literary genre to which they belong, and, especially,
to define their relationship with the philosophical system which inspired.
them. Finally, without trying to produce a biography of the emperor, I
will try to determine how much of him is visible in his work.
I have chosen to quote the Meditations abundantly. I hate those monographs
which, instead of letting the author speak and staying close to the
text, engage in obscure elucubrations which claim to carry out an act of
decoding and reveal the "unsaid" of the thinker, without the reader's
having the slightest idea of what that thinker really "said." Such a
method unfortunately permits all kinds of deformations, distortions, and
sleight of hand. Our era is captivating for all kinds of reasons: too often,
however, from the philosophical and literary point of view, it could be
defined as the era of the misinterpretation, if not of the pun: people can,
it seems, say anything about anything. When I quote Marcus Aurelius, I
want my reader to make contact with the text itself, which is superior to
any commentary. I would like him to see how my interpretation tries to
base itself on the text, and that he can verify my affirmations directly and
immediately. The translation I offer is completely original. I have been
working on Marcus Aurelius for more than twenty years, in particular on
a new edition and translation of the Meditations, which will be published
within the next few years. In the course of this work, interpretation and
translation have gone hand in hand, and this is why I could not illustrate
my arguments by referring the reader to existing translations, which
would have been different from mine, and which might not have corresponded
exactly with my idea of the philosopher-emperor's work.
I should like to thank Michael Chase for his sensitive and philologically
astute translation, as well as Angela Armstrong. Finally, my thanks
go to Margaretta Fulton and Mary Ellen Geer at Harvard University
Press, as well as Brian Stock at the University of Toronto, for their
patient and helpful advice.
Note on Transliteration and Quotation
I have sometimes found it useful to allude to certain Greek technical
terms which are peculiar to Stoic philosophy. I have tried to transliterate
them as simply as possible, using the letter e to represent the Greek letter
eta, and o to represent the letter omega.
In order not to multiply my notes unnecessarily, the references for the
quotations from Marcus Aurelius and the Discourses of Epictetus have
been indicated in parentheses within the text. In both cases, the first
number refers to the number of the book, the second to the chapter
number, and the third to the paragraph number within the chapter.
Unless I indicate otherwise, the references given in Chapters 4 and 5
always refer to the text of the Discourses of Epictetus.
The Greek text of Marcus Aurelius on which my translations are based
is generally that of W. Theiler, Marc Aurel, Wege zu sich selbst (Zurich:
Artemis Verlag, 1 974) .
Translator's Note
I have used the following procedure in rendering Pierre Hadot's translations:
I first literally translated Hadot's French version, and then compared
it with the original Greek or Latin texts. We have exchanged
correspondence about doubtful cases, and this process has resulted in a
number of corrections with regard to the 1 992 French edition of this
work. The final result is, I hope, a translation which, insofar as is possible,
is faithful both to Pierre Hadot and to the Greek and Latin authors to
whom he has so fruitfully dedicated his life. Finally, all notes enclosed in
square brackets are my own.
THE I N NER CITADEL

1
THE EMPERO R-PHILO SOP HER
A happy youth, a tormented reign
The future Marcus Aurelius, who was to receive this name later on, as a
result of his adoption by the emperor Aurelius Antoninus Pius, was born
in Rome in l 2 l, and was initially named Marcus Anni us V erus. The
families of his mother and father possessed a number of brick factories, 1
which represented an enormous fortune and a considerable investment
of capital. Such wealth allowed its holders to exercise political influence,
and the factory owners often attained positions from which they could
influence construction programs, as was the case for Marcus Aurelius'
grandfather.
After his grandfather died during his early childhood, Marcus was
noticed, protected, and favored by the emperor Hadrian. Just before his
death in 138, the latter, in order to ensure his succession, adopted Antoninus-uncle-in-law
of the future Marcus Aurelius-and asked him to
adopt Marcus as well as Lucius V erus, the son of Aelius Caesar, whom
Hadrian had initially chosen as his successor, but who had just died.
On July IO, 138, Hadrian was succeeded by Antoninus. One year later,
the future Marcus Aurelius, at the age of eighteen, was raised to the
dignity of Caesar. In 145, he married Faustina, daughter of Antoninus.
The couple had thirteen children, of whom only six survived beyond
childhood: five daughters and one son, the future emperor Commodus. 2
The correspondence which Marcus exchanged with his rhetoric
teacher Fronto, which lasted nearly thirty years-from 139 to 1 66/ r 67,
the date of Fronto's death3-provides us with precious details on this
period of Marcus Aurelius' life, as well as on the atmosphere at the court
of the Antonines: family life, children's illnesses, wine-making, the future
emperor's studies and readings, the rhetorical homework which he
punctually sent to Fronto, and the tender friendship which linked not
only the master and the student, but also the families of Marcus Aurelius
2 THE I N NER CITADEL
and of Fronto. At the death of Antoninus (161), Marcus Aurelius, then
thirty-nine years old, became emperor, and he immediately had equal
power conferred upon his adoptive brother, Lucius Verus.
In the same year as their common accession to the throne, the
Parthians invaded the eastern provinces of the Empire. The campaign
began with a disaster for the Roman army, whereupon Lucius was sent
east, where, under the command of two seasoned warriors, Statius Priscius
and Avidius Cassius, the Roman troops regained the upper hand
(1 63-1 66) . They invaded the Parthian kingdom, and seized Ctesiphon
and Seleucia.
No sooner had the ceremonies celebrating the two emperors' victory
of 1 66 ended when most alarming news arrived from another border of
the Empire. The Marcomanni and the Quadi, Germanic peoples from
the region of the Danube, were threatening the North of ltaly. The two
emperors were obliged to come and restore order to the situation, and
spent the winter at Aquileia. At the beginning of the year l 69, however,
Lucius died in the carriage in which he was riding along with Marcus
Aurelius. From 1 69 to 1 75, the Emperor then had to carry out military
operations in the region of the Danube.
In 175, at the very moment when he was beginning to enjoy some
success, Marcus received word of the rebellion of Avidius Cassius, who,
as a result of a plot which had spread through several provinces of the
East and of Egypt, had himself proclaimed Emperor. Marcus Aurelius
was probably saved on this occasion by the loyalty of Martius Verus, the
governor of Cappadocia. At any rate, as the Emperor was preparing to
leave for the East, he learned of the assassination of Avidius Cassius,
which put an end to this tragic episode.
Marcus Aurelius nevertheless decided to travel to the eastern provinces,
accompanied by Faustina and their son Commodus; he went to
Egypt, Syria, and Cilicia, where Faustina died. Ancient historians loved
to linger over Faustina's numerous adulteries; whatever may be the truth
behind this gossip, the Emperor was profoundly affected by her loss, and
it is with deep emotion that, in the Meditations (I, 1 7, 1 8), he evokes the
memory ofhis wife, so "docile, so loving, and so upright."
On his way back to Rome, the Emperor passed through Smyrna and
then Athens, where, together with Commodus, he was initiated into the
Eleusinian Mysteries. The festivities celebrating the victories over the
Germans and the Sarmatians took place at Rome, on December 23, 1 76,
but Marcus Aurelius had to leave once again for the Danubian front in
178. He died at Sirmium or at Vienna in 1 80.
The Emperor-Philosopher 3
The Empire was ravaged by natural catastrophes even more than by
wars during this period: floodings of the Tiber (161), earthquakes at
Cyzicus (161) and at Smyrna (1 78) , and above all the terrible plague
epidemic brought back from Asia by Roman troops returning from the
Parthian war (166) . As ]. F. Gilliam has shown,4 this plague did not
perhaps bring about the vast depopulation which has been described by
certain historians, who have made it the decisive cause of the decline of
Rome, but it certainly did have serious consequences for the social and
economic life of the Empire.
What a tormented reign it was! No sooner had Marcus Aurelius ascended
the throne than he was suddenly overwhelmed by natural disasters,
military and political difficulties, and family cares and mournings,
which forced him to engage in a battle every day.
The sober-albt:it partial-judgment of Cassius Dio5 is one of the
most just that have been made on the subject of Marcus: "He didn't have
the luck which he deserved . . . but was confronted, throughout his
reign, by a multitude of disasters. That is why I admire him more than
any other, for it was amidst these extraordinary and unparalleled difficulties
that he was able to survive, and to save the Empire."
As Ferdinand Lot has written,6 " The Roman world saw a series of
sovereigns succeed to the throne the likes of which history has never
seen since, and this happened precisely at the time first of the stagnation,
and then of the decline of the ancient world." After enumerating the
examples of Marcus Aurelius, Septimius Severus, Diocletian, Julian, and
Theodosius, among others, he continues: " Statesmen, legislators, warriors,
they sped from Brittany to the Rhine, from the Rhine to the
Danube, from the Danube to the Euphrates, in order to defend the
Roman world and civilization against the Germanic or Sarmatian Barbarians,
against the Parthians, and then against the Persians. They all
knew that their lives were constantly threatened . . . And they abandoned
themselves fearlessly to their tragic destiny as supermen. For if
ever supermen have existed, we have to look for them among the emperors
of the second to the fourth century." Such is the perspective
within which we must situate the personality of Marcus Aurelius, if we
hope to catch a glimpse of it.
Evolution toward philosophy
In this work, however, the goal is not to write the biography of one of
these "supermen. "7 Our task shall only be to ask how Marcus Aurelius
4 THE I N NER CITADEL
came to write the Meditations; and this is the same as asking how he
became a philosopher, and how the Meditations could represent for him a
part of his philosophical activity.
First, it is perhaps not inappropriate to recall that a philosopher in
antiquity was not necessarily a theoretician of philosophy, as is all too
often supposed. In antiquity, a philosopher was someone who lived like a
philosopher-that is, who led a philosophical life. Cato the Younger, a
statesman of the first century B.c., was a Stoic philosopher, but he did not
write a single philosophical treatise. Rogatianus, a statesman of the third
century A.D., was a Platonic philosopher, the disciple of Plotinus, and yet
he wrote no philosophical treatise. Neverthless both men considered
themselves philosophers, because they had adopted a philosophical way
oflife. Let it not be said, moreover, that they were amateur philosophers.
In the view of the masters of ancient philosophy, authentic philosophy
was not that which discoursed upon theories or commented upon
authors. In the words of Epictetus (III, 21, 5), a Stoic who had a considerable
influence upon Marcus Aurelius: "Eat like a man, drink like a
man, get dressed, get married, have children, lead the life of a citizen ....
Show us all this, so that we can see whether or not you have really
learned something from the philosophers. "8
Ancient philosophers thus had no need to write. If, moreover, they
did write, it was not necessary for them to invent a new theory, or
develop any specific part of a system. It was enough for them to formulate
the fundamental principles of the school in favor of which they had
made their choice of life. When Marcus was writing the Meditations, he
did not invent anything new, and did not bring about any progress
within Stoic doctrine. This, however, is not to say that he was not a
philosopher, and especially not a Stoic philosopher.9
On the other hand, the fact of having taken some philosophy courses
did not necessarily mean that one was a philosopher. Lucius Verus,
Marcus Aurelius' adoptive brother, received instruction from the same
philosophy teachers as his brother, but no one would think of calling him
a philosopher. 10 The Latin author Aulus Gellius, Marcus' contemporary,
was a student of the Platonic philosopher Taurus at Athens. There is no
doubt that Gellius was interested in philosophy, and he cites many philosophical
texts in his works, but he makes no claim to lead a philosophical
life. Rhetoricians and statesmen found in philosophy courses training for
dialectics, and material to develop commonplaces in their discourses. As
Pronto wrote to Marcus: " Philosophy will give you the substance of
The Emperor-Philosopher 5
your discourse, and rhetoric its form. "11 They did not, however, feel
obliged to live like philosophers. This is why the Discourses of Epictetus,
as reported by Arrian, constantly remind the philosopher's audience that
philosophy does not consist in dialectical skillfulness or beautiful language,
but in the way one lives day-to-day life. To be a philosopher was
not to have received a theoretical philosophical education, or to be a
professor of philosophy. Rather, it was to profess, as a result of a conversion
which caused a radical change of life-style, a way of life different
from that of other people.
It would be extremely interesting to know, in all its details, the manner
in which Marcus' conversion to philosophy took place. Yet many
points remain obscure.
We possess two documents of capital importance on Marcus Aurelius'
evolution. The first is the correspondence between Marcus and his
rhetoric teacher Pronto, of which I have already spoken; unfortunately, it
has come down to us in a palimpsest discovered in the nineteenth century;
thus this collection of letters has been covered over by other writing,
and the chemical products which were used to make it legible have
caused irreparable deterioration of the manuscript, which contains gaps
and is often unreadable. The second piece of evidence comes from the
Emperor himself, who, as he wrote the first book of his Meditations,
mentioned all he owed to his parents, teachers, and friends; this is an
extremely concise text, which leaves us terribly unsatisfied. Still, with the
help of the meager indications we can glean from these sources, we can
distinguish a certain number of phases in Marcus' evolution toward
philosophy. Although later hagiographers asserted that he was "serious"
from childhood on, 12 we can discern an initial period of carefree youth,
which seems to have continued until the age of twenty, that is, into the
period when he was already Caesar. It is possible, however, that under
the influence of Diognetus, one of the teachers Marcus speaks about in
his Meditations (I, 6), the desire to live as a philosopher may have touched
him already at this period.
Marcus' conversion to philosophy seems to have been the work of
Junius Rusticus, who revealed to him the teachings of Epictetus, and his
conversion can probably be dated to the years 1 44-1 47. In any case,
when Marcus was twenty-five, in 146-147, he wrote Pronto a letter
which leaves no doubt as to his new state of mind. Besides, throughout
the first years of Marcus' elevation to the throne, Pronto makes almost
constant allusions to the philosophical way oflife of his Imperial student.
6 THE I N NER CITADEL
Carefree life of a young prince and dreams of a life of austerity
Marcus' letters to Pronto-particularly those he wrote when he was still
a young eighteen- or twenty-year-old Caesar-allow us to catch a
glimpse of the simple, familiar way of life which was led at the court of
Marcus' adoptive father Antoninus, particularly in the Imperial villas, far
away from Rome, to which Antoninus often liked to withdraw. The
family took part in the labors of the grape harvests, and there was no
luxury in the meals served, or even in the heating. The future emperor
liked physical exercise-especially hunting-which he seems to have
practiced without any particular scruples with regard to his subjects.
This, at least, is what we can glimpse from a letter which could date from
the years 1 40-1 43, only the first part of which has been preserved:
. . . When my father came back home from the vineyards, I went
riding, as usual. I got started and we gradually moved away. Suddenly,
in the middle of the road, there was a big flock of sheep, and
the place was deserted: there were four dogs, two shepherds, and
nothing else. When they saw this group of horsemen coming, one
of the shepherds said to the other, "Watch out for these horseman;
they're the kind that usually cause the most trouble." No sooner did
I hear this than I spurred my horse and headed him straight for the
flock; the terrified beasts scattered, running every which way, bleating
and in the utmost confusion. The shepherd threw his staff at me,
but it landed on the rider who was following me, and we fled.
Thus, he who was afraid oflosing a lamb wound up losing his staff!
Do you think I made this story up? No, it's true. I'd write you still
more about it, but they're coming to get me for my bath.13
In this childish prank, we catch the future emperor in an act of foolishness
and senselessness. We are a long way from the philosopher who will
later try, among other things, to render justice with the utmost scrupulousness.
Most of the time, moreover, the tone of these letters to Fronto
is very playful. It appears as though the young Caesar, that passionate
reader, who was no doubt trying his hardest to polish his skills at rhetoric,
was not thinking about anything else.
It does seem, however, that even in his childhood Marcus Aurelius
had seen what the ideal of a philosophical life could be. In the first book
of his Meditations (I, 6) , he attributes this aspiration for a life of austerity to
the influence of a certain Diognetus.14 The latter was one of the first
The Emperor-Philosopher 7
teachers Marcus had; he had taught him to write dialogues "while he was
still a child," and had turned him away from a game which had long been
practiced by young Greeks: mentioned by Aristophanes and Plato, it
consisted essentially in playing with quails by striking them lightly on the
head. 15 It was Diognetus, said Marcus, who gave him his love for philosophy
and inspired in him "the desire to sleep on a cot and a simple
animal-skin, and for things of this sort which belong to the 'Hellenic'
way of life." We shall return to this last phrase. For the moment, let us
note the correspondence between this note from the Meditations and the
indications given us by The Life ef Marcus Aurelius in the Historia
Augusta:16 "At the age of twelve, he adopted the costume of a philosopher,
and a little later the endurance of one, too. He used to study
dressed in a pallium-that is, a philosophers' cloak-and sleep on the
ground; his mother had all kinds of difficulty in getting him to stretch out
on a bed covered with animal skins."
A short cloak and a hard bed were the symbols of the Stoic philosophical
life. We find them in Seneca, who advises his disciple Lucilius to
practice this austerity from time to time, evoking Demetrius the Cynic
lying on his cot; in the younger Pliny, who speaks of the jurist Aristomore
of a philosopher than the so-called philosophers-whose bed called
to mind the simplicity of life of the ancients; and finally in the Stoic
Musonius, teacher of Epictetus, who declared that a cot and a simple
animal-skin are enough for sleeping.17
On this topic, we can well wonder whether " Hellenic way of life
(agoge), " the reading of the manuscripts of the Meditations, ought to be
preserved, or whether we should emend the reading to " Laconian way of
life (agoge)." For among the ancients, the "Hellenic way of life " tended
rather to designate Greek culture and civilization, both in its spiritual and
in its material forms: literature and philosophical discourses, to be sure,
but also the gymnasia and social way of life. 18 The expression "Laconian
way of life," by contrast, traditionally designated the "rough life" which
characterized at the same time Spartan education and philosophical
askesis. The word agoge was, moreover, often used by itself to designate
the life-style of the Lacedaemonians.19 In his life of the Spartan legislator
Lycurgus, Plutarch20 describes the way in which Spartan children were
brought up: once they reached the age of twelve, they lived without any
tunic, received only one cloak for the whole year, and slept on mattresses
which they themselves had made out of reeds.
The model of this style of life was strongly idealized by the philosophers,
especially the Cynics and Stoics. This was what F. Ollier21 has
8 THE I N NER CITADEL
termed the " Spartan mirage," and it was all the more a mirage in that
Sparta was a warlike, totalitarian state which "fashioned its citizens to
become the docile instruments of its will," whereas the Cynics and Stoics
considered personal moral value as the only goal of life. From Spartan
education, they retained only its training for perseverance, its return to a
natural life, and its contempt for social conventions. To cite only one
example: the Stoic Musonius considered that a disciple " educated Spartan
style " was in a better condition to receive philosophical instruction,
and he had praised at length the Lacedaemonians' frugal life-style.22 One
might add that the philosophers' cloak (Greek tribon, Latin pallium) worn
by the young Marcus Aurelius was none other than the Spartan cloak,
made of coarse cloth, that had been adopted by Socrates, Antisthenes,
Diogenes, and the philosophers of the Cynic and Stoic tradition. 23
How did Diognetus transmit to Marcus the desire for the austere life
of the philosophers and the Spartans? We do not know. Did he boast to
him of the free life of the Cynic or Stoic philosophers? Following the
example of Plutarch, did he tell him about the life of Lycurgus or of
Cleomenes? Be this as it may, he brought about in his student what we
might call an initial conversion toward philosophy.
Nevertheless, in the letters from Marcus to Fronto which date from
before the years 1 46-147, we do not perceive the slightest trace of this
youthful-or rather, childish-enthusiasm for the Spartan-style philosophical
way of life. No doubt it had been short-lived; and yet this fire,
though apparently extinguished, continued to smolder, and it would not
be long before it flared up once again.
Junius Rusticus
Ancient historians are unanimous in recognizing the vitally important
role played by Junius Rusticus in Marcus' evolution toward philosophy.
"His favorite teacher," says the Historia Augusta, 24 "was Junius Rusticus,
whose disciple he was and for whom he had the greatest respect. This
Rusticus was as effective in war as he was in peace, and he was a great
practitioner of the Stoic way of life. Marcus Aurelius consulted him on
all his business, whether public or private; he used to greet him with a
kiss even in front of the Praetorian prefect; honored him with a second
consulate, and, after his death, requested that the Senate raise statues of
him." The Historia Augusta could, moreover, have added that Rusticus'
first consulate, in 1 62 (the year after Marcus became emperor) , was
certainly intended as a sign of the disciple's gratitude toward his master.
When the historian Cassius Dio25 speaks of Marcus' philosophy teachers,
The Emperor-Philosopher 9
he mentions only Junius Rusticus and Apollonius of Chalcedon, both of
whom he depicts as Stoics. Later, in the fourth century, Themistius still
speaks of the privileged relationship between Junius Rusticus and the
Emperor.26
It will come as no surprise that a statesman, who was to become
Prefect of the City from 1 62 to 168, should be at the same time a
philosophy teacher. There was nothing extraordinary about this in antiquity:
Cicero and Seneca were also statesmen, and they too did not hesitate
to present themselves as philosophy teachers. There were two reasons
for this: in the first place, ancient philosophy was not restricted to
specialists and professionals, so that statesmen could perfectly well live as
philosophers and master philosophical discourse. Moreover, as has been
well shown by I. Hadot, 27 there was at Rome an old tradition according
to which young people attached themselves to older and more experienced
personages who initiated them into political life, but also into
ethical life. This was in particular the way they studied law-as Cicero
did under Scaevola-but young people could also be initiated into the
philosophical life in this way. From this perspective, we may say that
Junius Rusticus gave Marcus Aurelius private philosophy lessons, and
that he was at the same time his friend and his spiritual guide.
The first book of the Meditations renders him an extended homagethe
longest of any, in fact, except for that accorded to Marcus' adoptive
father, the emperor Antoninus (I, 7) :
From Rusticus. To have had some idea of the need I had to
straighten out my moral condition, and to take care of it.
That I did not let myself be dragged into sophistical ambition, or
to compose treatises on philosophical theorems, to declaim fine
exhortatory speeches, or, finally, to try to strike my audience's
imagination by parading myself ostentatiously as a man who practices
philosophical exercises, or is generous to a fault.
To have given up rhetoric, poetry, and refined expressions.
Not to walk around in a toga while I'm home, and not to let
myself go in such matters.
To write letters simply, just like the letter he himself wrote to my
mother from Sinuessa.
To be disposed, with regard to those who are angry with you and
offend you, in such a way as to be ready to respond to the first call,
and to be reconciled as soon as they themselves wish to return to
you.
To study texts with precision, without being content just to skim
IO THE I N NER CITADEL
over them in a general, approximate way; and not to give my assent
too quickly to smooth talkers.
To have been able to read the notes taken at the courses of
Epictetus, which he lent to me from his own library.
What Marcus learned from Rusticus was thus, in a sense, the opposite
of what he had learned from Diognetus. As Epictetus28 had said, the goal
of philosophy is not to wear a cloak, but to reason correctly. Philosophy
does not consist in sleeping on the ground, nor in writing dialogues, but
in rectifying one's character. It resides neither in sophistry, bookish dissertations,
nor pretentious declamations, nor in ostentatiousness, but
rather in simplicity. In this text, we can glimpse the conflict that separated
Franta and Rusticus in the orientation of Marcus' education: " To
have given up rhetoric, poetry, and refined expressions." Franta himself
referred to this opposition when, declaring himself delighted to see that
the new Emperor had spoken eloquently in public, although it had been
several years since he had refused to continue his rhetorical studies, he
wrote to him: " Of all the people I have known, I have never found
anyone gifted with a greater natural gift for eloquence. . . . My dear
Rusticus, our Roman, who would give his life or sacrifice it willingly to
save your little finger, was then forced to concede-much against his
will, and with a disgusted look on his face-that what I used to say about
your rhetorical talents was right. "29
His role as spiritual guide cannot always have been easy for Rusticus.
The mention ofRusticus' attitude toward those who got angry with him
does seem to be an allusion to the attitude of Marcus himself: in the same
first book of his Meditations, Marcus thanks the gods for having brought it
about that, although he frequently became angry with Rusticus, he never
went so far as to do something he might later regret (I, 1 7, 1 4). No doubt
relations between the two men were stormy, both during Marcus' youth,
when Rusticus pointed out to his disciple that he needed to reform his
character (I, 7, r) , and during the period when Rusticus was one of the
Emperor's advisers. Thus, Rusticus, by his indulgence and his gentleness,
showed Marcus the attitude that he too should adopt vis-a-vis those who
became irritated with him. It does seem as though one of the Emperor's
principal character defects was his tendency to become irritated easily.
Marcus Aurelius does not say a word about the Stoic doctrines taught
to him by Junius Rusticus. There is nothing surprising about this, for
although the first book of the Meditations draws up a list of what the
Emperor has received from his parents, his teachers, his friends, and the
The Emperor-Philosopher II
gods, it is a list of the models and practical advice which have been
offered to him, and not the description of a purely intellectual itinerary.
From this perspective, however, the mention of the notes taken during
the classes of Epictetus is sufficient, for compared to Epictetus, all the
Stoic teachers of Marcus' time were mere epigones. As far as Stoicism is
concerned, the figure of Epictetus dominated the entire second century.
For Marcus, this was the greatest benefit he had received from Rusticus,
for his Meditations were to be no more than variations-often superbly
orchestrated-on themes proposed by the philosopher-slave.
The reading of " Aris to "
Conversions are often thought to be events that happen instantaneously
in unexpected circumstances. History is filled with anecdotes of this
kind, whether they be about Polemon, after a night of debauchery,
stumbling by chance into the class of the Platonic philosopher Xenocrates;
Augustine hearing a child's voice telling him to " take this and read
it"; or Saul blinded on the road to Damascus. It would be nice to find the
traces of a sudden conversion to philosophy in the case of our philosopher-emperor
as well, and they have long been thought to have been
discovered in a letter from Marcus to his teacher Fronto,30 in which he
says that he is so upset that he is sad and is no longer eating.
At the beginning of this letter, Marcus mentions-in a half-joking
tone and without entering into details-a discussion he had had with his
friend Aufidius Victorinus, Fronto's son-in-law. Aufidius is bursting with
pride at having been a judge during an arbitration; he boasts-certainly
less than seriously-that he is the most just of all the men who had come
to Rome from Umbria, and he considers himself superior to Marcus
Aurelius, who is only an assessor and is happy just to sit and yawn beside
the judge. As Caesar-we learn from the rest of the letter that Marcus
was twenty-five years old at the time-Marcus had to assist the emperor
Antoninus in his judicial activity, and it is to this function that Aufidius is
probably alluding.31
After telling this story, Marcus moves on to another topic. Fronto is
coming to Rome, intending, as was his custom, to check on his pupil's
literary work. To be sure, Marcus is happy at the thought of his master's
visit, but he is extremely upset that he has not read the texts Fronto had
assigned to him (Plautus and Cicero, it would seem), and especially that
he has not written a rhetorical argument in which he was to plead for
both the pro and the contra side.
12 THE I N NER CITADEL
The reason for his falling behind, says Marcus, is his reading of Arista:
Aristo's books are a joy for me, and at the same time a torture. They
are a joy, in that they teach me better things; but when they show
me to what extent my inner dispositions (ingenium) are distant from
these better things, then all too often your disciple blushes and is
angry with himself because, at the age of twenty-five, I have not yet
assimilated into my soul any of the salutary dogmas and purest
reasonings. This is why I am tormented, angry, and jealous, and I no
longer eat.
In the third part of his letter, Marcus announces to Fronto that he is
going to follow the advice of an ancient orator: under certain circumstances,
the laws must be allowed to sleep. He will therefore let Aristo's
books sleep a little, and devote himself to the rhetorical work he had
promised his teacher. However, in his current state of mind, it would be
impossible for him to argue simultaneously for and against some matter-that
is, we are to understand, as if the justice or injustice of the
matter in question were indifferent to him.
Traditionally, this letter has been considered as the story of Marcus'
conversion, which would thus have occurred at the age of twenty-five,
and the Arista spoken of here has consequently been identified with
Arista of Chios, a Stoic of the third century B.C. On this interpretation, it
was the reading of this author which brought about this sudden transformation.

E. Champlin has recently expressed his doubts about this interpretation.
32 This author starts off from the observation that the beginning and
end of the letter allude to jurisprudence, with the beginning evoking
Aufidius' pride as a judge, and the end speaking, a propos of Aristo's
books, of "letting the laws sleep," and he concludes that the middle part
of the letter is also to be interpreted in the context of jurisprudence. The
books mentioned by Marcus would therefore be those not of Arista of
Chios, but of Titus Arista, a Roman jurisconsult of the time of Trajan,
whose ascetic image had been evoked in one of the letters of Pliny the
Younger. When he describes the effect made on him by these works,
therefore, Fronto's student is not at all speaking of his regrets at not yet
being a philosopher, but of his sadness at not yet having sufficiently
studied jurisprudence. This is why at the end of the letter, the books of
Arista are identified with the laws which must sometimes be allowed to
sleep.
The Emperor-Philosopher 13
This interpretation has been criticized by R. B. Rutherford,
H. Gorgemanns, and mysel£33 In the first place, it seems completely
unlikely that, at the age of twenty-five, Marcus could cry out, a propos of
some books on jurisprudence: "At the age of twenty-five, I have not yet
assimilated into my soul any of the salutary dogmas and the purest reasonings,"
and that he could speak of the distance of his "inner dispositions"
as compared to the ideal he has discovered. Moreover, the irritation,
sadness, and loss of appetite,34 even when we take rhetorical
amplification into account, would seem highly exaggerated if they were
the result of a temporary passion for jurisprudence.
Second, it is somewhat facile to attempt to interpret the letter as if it
dealt with the one theme of jurisprudence, and with that theme alone.
The story of Aufidius Victorinus forms a whole, independent of what
follows it. Finally, the formula "to let the laws sleep " was a proverbial
expression, 35 meaning that, in cases of serious crises, we must sometimes
resign ourselves to silencing our moral principles.
Champlin bases his argument on the fact that, already in antiquity, all
the works of Aristo of Chios were considered to be apocryphal. To be
sure, it is virtually certain that this philosopher, like many others from
Socrates down to Epictetus, gave only oral instruction and wrote nothing.
Yet the list of his "works" as it existed in antiquity enumerated, for
the most part, such titles as hypomnemata, scholai, and diatribai, which
designated notes taken during class by students.36 This is also how the
teachings of Epictetus have come down to us: thanks to the notes taken
by Arrian, a statesman of the beginning of the second century A.D. It is
not impossible that Marcus had access to these notes taken at Aristo's
classes, or to extracts from the letter preserved in the Stoic schools. He
may also have read a collection of " Comparisons" (Homoiomata) by the
same Aristo, which was popular down to the end of antiquity, and which
moreover does seem authentic, since it accords with what we know of
Aristo's teaching from other sources. For instance, we know that he
considered dialectics to be useless, and we find sayings in this collection
which illustrate this view. The reasonings of the dialecticians, says Aristo,
are like spiders' webs: completely useless, but ingenious. Those who
conduct advanced studies of dialectics are like people eating crayfish:
they struggle with a lot of shell for very little nourishment. Dialectics is
like mud on the road: it is completely useless, and it makes those who
walk fall down. We should also note the following remark on the brevity
of life: the time and life accorded to men are very short; sleep, like a
tutor, takes away half of it from us.37 It should be noted as well that
14 THE I N NER CITADEL
Marcus could have known Aristo through Cicero and Seneca, who had
spoken about him.38
In the final analysis, however, our problem is not that of knowing
which Aristo Marcus read. According to the testimony of Pliny, the
jurisconsult Titus Aristo used to live like a philosopher, and he too can
perfectly well, after all, have written philosophical works. The only thing
we can say with certainty is that the letter reveals the complete upheaval
that his reading of philosophical books brought about in Marcus.
It is nevertheless difficult to admit that it was the mere reading of
Aristo of Chios-if the books in question were genuinely by him-that
brought about Marcus' conversion and had a considerable influence on
his thought, for the characteristics which, according to ancient tradition,
distinguished the teaching of Aristo of Chios are not found in the Meditations
of Marcus Aurelius. On this point, I must correct an interpretation
which I had proposed in a previous study, and I shall return later to this
doctrinal problem. 39
Marcus states quite clearly in the first book of his Meditations that the
decisive influence on him came from his reading of the Discourses of
Epictetus, which Junius Rusticus had obtained for him. We must imagine
Marcus' conversion rather as a slow evolution, brought about by his
frequenting of Junius Rusticus, and of other philosophers of whom I
shall speak shortly. Besides, we must not forget that many of Marcus'
letters to Fronto are lost. It is probable that, in other missives, the student
let his teacher know that he was becoming more and more detached
from rhetoric, and that he wanted to devote himself to the improvement
of his inner dispositions. He tried to do so with delicacy, and a bit of
self-deprecating irony, as in the present letter. Marcus' reading of Aristo,
whoever he may have been, represents only a moment and a milestone
in a long process. Marcus certainly read many other authors, just as he
listened to different philosophy teachers. What is of interest here, however,
is that the first evidence we have of his adherence to philosophy
may be dated approximately from his twenty-fifth year.
Professors and friends
In addition to Junius Rusticus, Marcus and the ancient historians name
other philosophy teachers, in particular Apollonius of Chalcedon and
Sextus of Chaeronea. Junius Rusticus was the spiritual guide who was
very close to his disciple, whereas Apollonius and Sextus were professors
The Emperor-Philosopher 15
in charge of a school, where Marcus had to go hear their lectures.
According to the Historia Augusta, Apollonius-whom the ancient historians
depict as a Stoic-refused to come to the palace to give lessons to
his royal student: " The disciple must come to the master," he is supposed
to have said, "and not the master to the disciple." The emperor Antoninus
Pius, who had had him sent for at great expense from distant Chalcedon
to teach the young Caesar Stoicism, remarked on this occasion40
that it was easier to get Apollonius to come from Chalcedon to Rome
than to get him to come from his house to the palace.
In the first book of the Meditations (I, 8), Marcus mentions Apollonius
immediately after Rusticus. Here again, Marcus makes no allusion to the
content of Apollonius' teaching; rather, what he retains from his teacher
are moral attitudes and practical advice: on freedom; on the art of reconciling
extremes-for example, to come to a decision after lengthy reflection,
but without putting it off; to be on the alert but at the same time
relaxed;41 not to consider oneself bound by the favors one has received,
but not to disdain them either. In Marcus' eyes, Apollonius was a teacher
who did not give himself the airs of a great professor. He did not consider
the experience and teaching skills he had acquired to be his main qualities,
and he did not go in for nitpicking when it came to the explanation
of texts. When Apollonius died before Marcus became emperor, the
latter was deeply grieved, and wept abundantly. The courtiers reproached
Marcus for his demonstration of affection, probably because
they considered his philosophical pretensions to be a joke, and wanted to
show him that he was being unfaithful to his own principles. However,
the emperor Antoninus Pius said to them: "Let him be a man. Neither
philosophy nor the Empire can uproot affections. "42
Marcus, then, attended the school of Apollonius while he was still a
young Caesar. It seems, however, that it was after he became emperor,
when Marcus was already growing old, that he attended the lectures of
Sextus of Chaeronea. The latter was, according to the Historia Augusta, 43
a Stoic, whereas the collection known as the Souda44 calls him a skeptic,
no doubt confusing him with the famous skeptic Sextus Empiricus. According
to the Souda, Marcus frequently took Sextus along as his assessor
when he had trials to judge. The story was told that a certain Lucius, a
philosopher of Marcus' time famous for his uninhibited speech, asked
Marcus why he went to Sextus' school. Marcus replied: "Learning is a
good thing, even for one who is growing old. From Sextus the philosopher
I shall learn what I do not yet know." Lucius raised his hands
16 THE I N NER CITADEL
skyward: " Oh Zeus," he cried, " the aging Emperor of the Romans is
hanging tablets around his neck in order to go to school, while my king
Alexander died at the age of thirty-two! "45
Sextus also appears in the first book of Marcus' Meditations (I, 9) , right
after Apollonius. Among other things, what Marcus retained from Sextus
were his benevolence, the way in which he directed his household, the
model he provided of a life in accordance with nature, his simple gravity,
his gift of guessing his friends' feelings, his patience, his ability to adapt
himself to each person, and to join together impassibility and tenderness.
At the same time, however, Marcus also evokes part ofSextus' teachings,
for instance his ability to set in order "the fundamental principles (dogmata)
necessary for life, with evidence and method," and above all "the
idea of a life in conformity with nature." This last detail does seem to
confirm that Sextus was a Stoic.
We have no way of knowing whether there were any differences
between the teachings of Apollonius and those of Sextus. It is likely that
there were few, and that the Stoics of the time were all more or less
dependent upon the teachings of Musonius Rufus and his student
Epictetus. Fronto, at least, considered that the famous philosophers of his
day-Euphrates, Dion, Timocrates, and Athenodotus-were all disciples
of Musonius Rufus.46 Besides, if Marcus followed a regular course of
study in the schools of Apollonius and of Sextus, this means that he
studied the three parts of philosophy: not only ethics, but also the theory
of nature and dialectics. When, in a letter to Marcus, Fronto reproaches
him47 for studying dialectics and the refutation of sophisms, it is perhaps
not a case of rhetorical exaggeration.
Apart from these philosophers in charge of schools, whose classes
Marcus attended, we find among his teachers Roman statesmen who
professed philosophy. It seems to me that this is clearly apparent from the
plan of the first book of the Meditations, in which Marcus evokes successively
his parents; the educators he had during his childhood, in particular
Diognetus; the dominant figure of his spiritual guide Junius Rusticus,
who, for Marcus, was linked to his conversion to philosophy; Apollonius
and Sextus, the two professors whose schools he attended; Alexander the
Grammarian and Fronto, his grammar and rhetoric teachers; and Alexander
the Platonist,48 a rhetorician who became Marcus' secretary for
Greek correspondence about I 70. The Emperor considered the lastnamed
figure as a "friend," and retained from him some lessons about
moral conduct.
The three names which follow-Catulus, Severus, and Maximus-
The Emperor-Philosopher 17
form a group not of professors but of friends. They were no doubt older
men who, like Junius Rusticus, either were statesmen or least had had a
political career, but who also had an influence on the development of
Marcus' philosophical life. The Maximus in question was Claudius
Maximus, proconsul of Africa and philosopher, whom Apuleius mentions
in his Apology. The Historia Augusta presents Claudius Maximus and
Cinna Catulus as Stoics, and there is no good reason to doubt this
testimony, since the same Historia Augusta is perfectly well aware that
Severus-that is, Claudius Severus Arabianus, consul in 1 46-was an
Aristotelian.49 The son of this individual, also a consul, was also an Aristotelian;
this is explicitly stated by Galen,50 who tells how Severus' son
used to attend the public sessions of anatomy, with commentary, which
the famous doctor had organized for the Roman nobility. 51
Marcus then goes on to evoke the Emperor Antoninus (I, 16), of
whom Marcus paints, as it were, the portrait of the ideal prince that he
himself would have liked to be. Philosophy is not absent from this
description, for Antoninus is compared to Socrates, who was able both to
enjoy pleasures and to abstain from them, according to the circumstances.

Book I concludes with Marcus recalling all the benefits he has received
from the gods, foremost among which, he says, were his encounters
with the philosophers Apollonius, Rusticus, and Maximus. The final
lines of this first book do seem to allude to chapter 7, in which the
Emperor had expressed his gratitude to Rusticus for having dissuaded
him from sophistical ambition, bookish dissertations, and pretentious
declamations, and for having thus revealed to him that philosophy was a
way oflife.
According to his own testimony in Book I, then, it was to Junius
Rusticus that Marcus owed his discovery of true philosophy and of the
thought of Epictetus. The Stoic teachings of Apollonius and of Sextus
were then added to this decisive contribution, while from his "friends"
Alexander the Platonist, Claudius Maximus, Claudius Severus, and
Cinna Catulus he received the advice and the examples which helped
him to live his philosophical life.
The philosopher-emperor
When, on March 7, r 6 r, Marcus became emperor, it was an unexpected
and extraordinary event. Rome now had an emperor who professed to
be a philosopher-not only that, but a Stoic philosopher. Fronto, for
18 THE I N NER CITADEL
one, was less than reassured to see such a man governing the Empire:
philosophy, he felt, could be a bad inspiration. In a letter to Aufidius
Victorinus about a juridical problem Marcus was facing concerning the
will of his extremely wealthy aunt Matidia, Fron to wrote: "I was greatly
afraid that his philosophy might persuade him to make the wrong decision.
"52 For Fronto, moreover, Stoic philosophy as Marcus understood it
was the enemy of eloquence, which Fronto held to be indispensable for a
sovereign. He wrote to the Emperor:
Even should you attain the wisdom of Cleanthes or of Zeno, you
shall still be obliged, like it or not, to wear the purple pallium, and
not that of the philosophers, made of coarse wool. 53
" ... and so," we are to understand, "you are darned well going to have
to speak in public, and remember my rhetoric classes."
Throughout the years in which Marcus was weighed down by the
heavy burdens of the Empire, Fronto was to become the advocate of
common sense, as opposed to philosophical rigor. For example, he advised
the Emperor to relax and take a real vacation during his stay on the
coast at Alsium: "Even your Chrysippus himself, they say, used to get
plastered every day. "54 When Fronto speaks of "your Chrysippus," by
the way, it should be noted that although some modern historians-no
doubt fond of paradoxes-have wondered whether or not Marcus considered
himself a Stoic,55 his friend Fronto certainly had no such doubts.
When he speaks of the Emperor's philosophy, he spontaneously brings
up the great names of Stoicism: Cleanthes, Zeno, and Chrysippus. It is
clear that Marcus made no secret of his Stoic affinities.
Sometimes, Fronto is content to smile at the Emperor's infatuation: in
keeping with his dogmas (instituta tua), says Fronto, Marcus must have
remained imperturbable in a situation in which his life was threatened. 56
On another occasion, speaking about the Emperor's children whom he
had just visited, Fronto observed that one of them was holding a piece of
black bread in his hand, just like a real philosopher's son.57
The people, both in Rome and throughout the Empire, seem to have
been aware that the Emperor was a philosopher. Thus when, during his
reign, at the height of the Danubian wars, Marcus was forced to enlist the
gladiators, the current joke in Rome was that Marcus wanted to make
the people renounce their pleasures and constrain them to philosophy. 58
In this regard, the dedications of the Apologies that some Christian apologists
used to send to the Emperor are interesting. The emperors' titles
The Emperor-Philosopher 19
usually included the names they gave themselves after a victory, but in
Marcus' case we see that the Christian apologist Athenagoras added the
title of "philosopher" to the list: "To the Emperors Marcus Aurelius
Antoninus and Lucius Aurelius Commodus, Armenians, Sarmatians, and
above all philosophers." Here Commodus, Marcus' unworthy son,
benefits from his father's reputation. The same holds true for Marcus'
adoptive brother Lucius Verus, in the dedication-unfortunately corrupt
in its present state-which Justin placed at the beginning of his Apology.
In any case, Marcus, then still a Caesar, is called "philosopher" in it,
together with Lucius Verus. The reason these dedications mention the
title of "philosopher" is that the Apologists' arguments ran as follows:
Christianity is a philosophy-indeed the best of all philosophies. Therefore,
a philosopher-emperor must tolerate it.
In order to govern, the Emperor surrounded himself with philosophers.
I have already spoken of his Stoic "friends": Junius Rusticus,
consul in the year 1 62, Prefect of Rome around 165; Claudius Maximus,
proconsul of Africa; and Cinna Catulus. But there were not only Stoics;
there were also convinced Aristotelians like Claudius Severus, consul in
1 73 and Marcus' son-in-law, as well as all those whom Galen mentions in
the context of his sessions of dissection. Above all, there was the circle
which gravitated around the Peripatetic philosopher Eudemus of Pergamon:
Sergius Paulus, consul in 1 68, proconsul of Asia in 166-1 67,
Prefect of Rome around 168; Flavius Boethius, Governor of Palestinian
Syria around 1 66-168, who had been the student of the Peripatetic
Alexander of Damascus, and finally M. Vetulenus Civica Barbarus, consul
in 1 57, who had accompanied Marcus' daughter Lucilla on her trip to
Antioch, where she was to marry Lucius Verus. 59
Galen's testimony allows us to glimpse an intense philosophical activity
in the circles of the Roman aristocracy of Marcus' time, and it must
be emphasized once more that these philosophical statesmen were not
amateurs, vaguely interested in philosophical doctrines, but that they had
consciously chosen their philosophical school. Some were enthusiastic
Aristotelians, others Stoics. Thus, it was not just one philosopher who
governed the Empire at that time, but several philosophers. Galen recounts,
moreover, that there was a radical opposition between the court
of Marcus Aurelius and that of his adoptive brother Lucius Verus.
Around Marcus, it was the fashion to have one's head shaved, Stoic-style:
the poet Persius had referred to the adepts of this school as "sheared
youths, "60 who slept and ate but little. At Lucius Verus' court, by contrast,
the fashion was to wear one's hair long; and Lucius used to call
20 THE I N NER CITADEL
Marcus' entourage "mimologoi," or mimes, probably because he
thought they were playing at being philosophers in order to imitate the
Emperor.61 Cassius Dio, for his part, writes that under the reign of Marcus
Aurelius, many people gave the appearance of being philosophers, in
the hopes of attracting the Emperor's liberality.62
We have so far attempted, albeit too briefly, to glimpse how Marcus
became a philosopher. We now must ask ourselves how he came to write
the Meditations.
2
A FIRST GLIMPSE OF
THE MEDITA TIONS
The fate of a text
In our time, now that the printing and distribution of books are banal,
everyday operations, we no longer realize to what extent the survival of
any work of antiquity represented an almost miraculous adventure. If,
after having been dictated or written onto relatively fragile materials, and
then having been more or less disfigured by copyists' mistakes, a text
managed to survive until the birth of printing, it was only because it had
the good fortune not to be burned in one of the numerous library fires of
antiquity, or else simply did not fall into useless pieces. The odyssey of
Marcus Aurelius' Meditations seems to have been particularly risky.
In all probability, the Emperor wrote for himself and his own private
use, rather than by dictation. At his death, the notes Marcus wrote in this
way were saved and conserved by a family member, a friend, or an
admirer. Was it ever published, that is to say, copied down and distributed
to bookstores? It is difficult to say. Some scholars have thought that
they recognize analogies between the Meditations and the speech which,
according to the historian Cassius Dio, writing a few years after the
Emperor's death, Marcus delivered before his soldiers on the occasion of
the rebellion of Avidius Cassius.1 In fact, however, the analogies in expression
are not very specific; these were formulas which were fairly
widespread in the philosophical and literary tradition.
It does seem that, two centuries after Marcus, the philosopher Themistius
knew of the existence of the work: he speaks of paraggelmata2 or
" exhortations" written by Marcus. The historian Aurelius Victor and the
Historia Augusta claim that Marcus, before leaving on his expedition to
the Danubian front, had publicly set forth the precepts of his philosophy
in the form of a series of exhortations. 3 This is an interesting detail, for it
reveals that the writing of the Meditations was linked in a confused way
22 THE I N NER CITAD EL
with the wars against the Germans, which is not completely false. Much
later, in the fourteenth century, it would be imagined that the work was
a book composed with a view to the education of Marcus' son Commodus.
4 In any case, it seems that none of these authors had direct access
to the book of which they were speaking.
It was not until the Byzantine tenth century that we find testimonies
to the reading and copying of Marcus' works. The great Byzantine
lexicon entitled the Souda, which dates from that period, contains several
extracts from the Meditations, and specifies that Marcus Aurelius' work
consists of twelve books. 5 In addition, the bishop Arethas, in a letter of
907 addressed to Demetrius, metropolitan of Heraclea, speaks of a copy
of the philosopher-emperor's work in his possession, which is readable
but in poor condition. He has had it recopied, he writes, and can thus
bequeath it to posterity in renewed condition.6 There are, moreover,
several literal quotations from the Meditations in Arethas' works.7 In the
Byzantine world, the Meditations were read throughout the following
centuries. 8
In the West, we do not find quotations from Marcus until the beginning
of the sixteenth century: the De arte cabalistica of Johannes Reuchlin,
published in 1 51 7, contains quotations of two passages from the Meditations,
probably taken from a manuscript in Reuchlin's possession.9 It was
not until 1559 that a printed edition appeared, brought out by Andreas
Gesner of Zurich. Based on a now-lost manuscript, this edition was
accompanied by a Latin translation made by Xylander (Wilhelm
Holzmann) . Besides this edition, we have only one complete manuscript
of the Emperor's works: the Vaticanus Graecus 1 950, which dates from the
fourteenth century.
We can thus surmise that it is only a matter of luck that we happen to
know the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius. We must admit, however, that
in the case of a number of passages-fortunately not very numerousthe
state of the text as we now possess it is less than satisfactory; and given
the small number of manuscripts, it is difficult to improve upon the text.
In order to reestablish the text with the highest degree of probability,
therefore, we are sometimes reduced to making conjectures.
The text, is, in any event, rather difficult to understand, and the reader
should not be surprised if he finds that the original translation I am
proposing is sometimes rather different from other extant translations.
Moreover, it is because my interpretation of the thought of Marcus
Aurelius is based upon my way of translating the text that I have found it
necessary to include lengthy quotations from his work.
A First Glimpse of the Meditations 23
Neither in the manuscripts nor in the first edition, moreover, is there
any division of the work into chapters; and there are few paragraphs. The
first editors and translators who, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
worked with the first edition proposed a variety of divisions; but the
modern numeration is that of the Latin translation by Thomas Gataker,
published in Cambridge in 1652.10 Gataker's division, however, is in
need of complete revision. Some chapters must be reunited, and, above
all, many others must be subdivided, since a number of passages with
very different subject matter have been unjustifiably grouped together.
The reader should not be surprised, therefore, to encounter the divisions
I have introduced into a particular text, which will seem different from
those found in the other extant translations.
The title
As we have seen, it was the edition of 1559 which revealed Marcus
Aurelius to the West. The work quickly became a huge success, with
editions of the Greek text, and translations into Latin and the various
European languages, coming fast and furious. Soon, however, the following
question arose: under which genre should the work be classified?
In antiquity, a book's title allowed its readers to recognize immediately in
which category it should be situated. Moreover, it was not usually the
philosopher who gave the title to his writings: more often than not, the
classes he had written entered his school's library without a title. Then,
for convenience, his disciples and successors got the habit of referring to
the work by the part of philosophy or the specific question with which it
dealt-for example, Classes on Physics-sometimes accompanied by the
name of the addressee (Nichomachean Ethics). No doubt Plato chose the
titles of dialogues himself, but they are usually taken from the names of
the protagonists of the discussion: Charmides, Phaedo, Philebus. A book's
title was not then, as it is now, an invention of the author, by means of
which he tries to show off his originality and attract the reader by the
unusual nature of his formulations, as in The Bald Soprano, The Dancer and
the Chatterton, The Cook and the Man-eater.11
It is highly likely that when Marcus was writing what we now call the
Meditations, he had no idea of giving a title to these notes intended only
for himsel£ In antiquity, moreover, as long as a book remained unpublished-through
a public reading, for instance-it was almost always the
case that the author did not give it a title. Thus, we find the physician
Galen and the philosopher Plotinus entrusting their texts to friends,
24 THE INNER CITA D EL
without providing them with titles.12 Their works, which they had given
to their entourage, were in the state of what the ancients used to call
hypomnemata: that is to say, notes not yet quite revised for publication,
and lacking a title. This is all the more true if, as is probably the case,
Marcus' work was made up of a collection of strictly personal and private
notes. When Arethas13 (ninth to tenth centuries), to whom we no doubt
owe the preservation of our precious text, describes the condition of his
manuscript, he merely designates it as " the very profitable book of the
Emperor Marcus." The fact that he does not give it a title may well lead
us to believe that the manuscript did not bear one. Likewise, the epigram
dedicated to Marcus' book, perhaps composed by Theophylactus Simocattes
(seventh century), does not give any title.14 When Arethas wrote
his scholia on Lucian, he quotes the work as follows: Marcus in "the
ethical writings addressed to himself" (ta eis heauton Ethika). The Byzantine
dictionary called the Souda15 says of Marcus: " He consigned the rule
(agoge) of his personal life in twelve books." Finally, let us recall that
Themistius, in the third century, made extremely vague allusions to some
paraggelmata, or " exhortations" of Marcus Aurelius.
The Vatican manuscript gives no title to the Emperor's work. Some
manuscript collections of extracts from it do bear the notice: ta kat'
heauton, which could be translated: "Writing concerning Himself, " or
"Private Writing."
After the publication of the Greek text in 1 559, various translations,
corresponding to various theories and interpretations, were given to the
work. Xylander's translation, which accompanied the Greek text in
1559, proposed the title De seipso seu vita sua (" On Himself or on His
Life "). In the editions of Strasburg (1590) and of Lyon (1626) , the title
was De vita sua ("On his life "). When Meric Casaubon published his
Graeco-Latin edition in London in 1 643, he preferred the title De seipso
et ad seipsum ("About Himself and to Himself"); but when the English
translation appeared in 163 4, he had entitled it Meditations concerning
himselfe. Thomas Gataker, another English humanist of the same period,
placed the following formula at the beginning of his Latin translation
with commentary: De rebus suis sive de eis quae ad se pertinere censebat (" On
His Private Affairs, or the Matters which He Thought Concerned
H"m") 1 .
Thus, the work was to receive all kinds of titles, in all sorts of languages.
In Latin: De officio vitae ("On the Duty of Life "); Pugillaria ("Tablets")
; Commentaria quae ipse sibi scripsit ("Notes which He Wrote for
Himself") . In French: Pensees morales ("Moral Thoughts") ; Pensees
A First Glimpse of the Meditations 25
("Thoughts") ; A moi-meme ("To Myself") . In English: Conversations with
Himself; Meditations; Thoughts; To Himself; Communings with Himself; and
in German, Betrachtungen uber sich selbst or mit sich selbst ("Reflections on
Himself" or "with Himself") ; Selbstbetrachtungen ("Reflections on Himself")
; Wege zu sich selbst ("Paths toward Himself") .
Hypotheses on the work's literary genre
Many historians and readers of the Meditations did not understand, and
still do not understand, what Marcus Aurelius' intentions were in writing
them down. Consequently, they have projected back upon him, in a
totally anachronistic way, the prejudices and literary habits of their own
time . The first editor, "Xylander" (Holzmann) , noting that the text he
was publishing lacked the fine structure of a dialogue by Plato or a
treatise by Cicero, had already conjectured that the Meditations, in the
state in which they existed in the manuscript he was editing, were only
loose extracts from the works of Marcus Aurelius, and that the Emperor's
book had come down to us mutilated, incomplete, and in utter disorder.
16 It seemed to him inconceivable that Marcus could have left these
obscure, disorderly texts to posterity, since in this period the systematic
treatise was considered the perfect form of philosophical production.
Meric Casaubon, who translated Marcus Aurelius into English and
Latin in the seventeenth century (1634 and 1643 respectively), seems to
have been much better informed about the variety of literary genres in
antiquity. In the Preface to his Latin translation, he reminds his readers
that there then existed the literary genre of the aphorism-used, for
example, by Theognis and Phocylides-which consisted in expressing
one's thoughts in the form of short sayings; he added that Epictetus'
Manual, as composed by Arrian, was presented entirely in this way.
Moreover, he adds, if one is able to discern the real unities that make up
the text, one will be better able to understand both the flow of ideas
within each passage and the themes which often recur throughout the
work.
Besides, Casaubon went on, we must not forget that Marcus was
writing for himself, and was not seeking clarity, as an author would who
was addressing himself to the public. This gives Casaubon17 the opportunity
to criticize the custom that had arisen in his time of quoting Marcus'
work by the title De vita sua (" On His Life "). True, he writes, some
emperors--such as Augustus-did write books about their lives; but
their subj ect was the acts and events of their public and private lives.
26 THE I N NER CITA D EL
With Marcus this is not the case; rather, as the Souda indicated, what we
have is a writing dealing with "the rule of his own life." Some editors
had expressed this idea by means of the title De cifficio suo ("On His
Duty") ; but this did not render the specificity of the title Eis heauton,
which, in order to be rendered with exactitude, must be translated as De
seipso et ad seipsum ("About Himself and to Himself") . Thus, the work is
a dialogue Marcus had with himself and about himself Casaubon here
reminds the reader that Solon was supposed to have written some " Instructions
for Himself" (hypothekas eis heauton); above all, he reminds the
reader that, for the Platonists and the Stoics, the "self" was the soul or the
spirit.
Thomas Gataker defines the specific character of the work even more
precisely. He opposes the Discourses of Epictetus-transmitted to us by
his disciple Arrian, who was thus their editor, just as the Evangelists were
in the case of Christ-to the writings of Marcus, which emanated from
his own notes. Gataker uses the word adversaria, meaning "that which is
always in front of one," or " the rough draft which one always has
handy." The Emperor's mind, says Gataker, was always devoted to
philosophical occupations, and he developed the habit of writing down
the thoughts that came to him in the course of his meditations, without
feeling compelled to put them into any kind of order. They were arranged
solely in accordance with the places and times in which he had
either composed them himself, or encountered them in the course of his
readings and conversations. This is shown, moreover, by such remarks as
" In the Land of the Quades" and "At Carnutum," placed at the beginning
of Books II and III. This resulted in some inconsistencies and
repetitions, and a style that is often elliptical or abrupt: sufficient to allow
the Emperor to recall such-and-such an idea, but liable to lead to a great
deal of obscurity. These were notes intended for Marcus' personal use.18
As early as the beginning of the seventeenth century, however, the
philologist Caspar Barth,19 writing in 1 624, emphasized that traces of
organization, and sometimes even long chains of reasoning, could be
found in Marcus' writings. Barth thus returned to the theory of Xylander,
according to which the text, in the state in which it had been
preserved, represented mere extracts (eclogai) taken from a vast systematic
treatise on ethics which the Emperor was supposed to have composed.
In the eighteenth century, an analogous opinion was set forth by
Jean-Pierre de Joly, who edited and translated the Meditations in 1 742 and
again in l 77 3. Marcus, said Joly, had composed a systematic treatise on
ethics, written on tablets which were dispersed after his death; an editor
A First Glimpse of the Meditations
then published them in their state of disorder. The task of the modern
editor, then, was to rediscover the systematic order of the treatise; and
this is what Joly attempted to do by publishing a systematic presentation
of the Meditations, divided into thirty-five sections. 20
In the twentieth century, A. S. L. Farquharson published, in I 944, an
edition, English translation, and commentary on Marcus' text which was
remarkable in every respect. He took up the hypothesis ofBarth and Joly
from another angle: for a period of ten to fifteen years, he thought,
Marcus had accumulated materials of every variety with a view to the
composition of " a work of consolation and of encouragement." Indeed,
certain meditations do show signs of highly conscientious literary composition.
After the Emperor's death, it was perhaps a secretary who made
a choice from among these notes. Their present disorder could be the
result either of the fact that the secretary left them as they were, or that
he introduced into them an order which does not satisfy us, or the fact
that the text has been mutilated or disorganized by scribes through the
course of the years. In any event, Marcus' intention was to write a
handbook of useful advice for the philosophical life. In Farquharson's
view, Marcus' Meditations can be compared to the Meditations of Guigues
of Chartres, the well-known Religio Medici of Thomas Browne, and
above all the Pensees of Pascal.21
The apparent lack of order of the Meditations did not disturb nineteenth-century
readers at all. In the century of Romanticism, it was
thought that the work was the Emperor's own "journal intime." " It is
probable," wrote Renan,22 "that Marcus kept a private diary of his inner
states starting from an early age. In it, he would inscribe in Greek the
maxims to which he had recourse in order to fortify himself, reminiscences
from his favorite authors, passages from those moralists who most
impressed him, the principles which had sustained him throughout the
day, and sometimes the reproaches which his scrupulous conscience
thought it had to address to itself " I should state right away that, if we
understand by " diary" notes which one writes for oneself and which
accumulate day after day, then we can indeed say, with G. Misch in his
History ef Autobiography, 23 that the Emperor did write a " diary," or, in the
words of P. Brunt24 in his excellent study entitled "Marcus Aurelius in his
Meditations, " a "spiritual diary." If, however, we understand by "diary" a
writing to which one consigns the outpourings of one's heart and spiritual
states, then the Meditations are not a " diary," and the fact that Marcus
Aurelius wrote his Meditations does not allow us, as Renan claimed, to
know whether or not the Emperor had an uneasy soul. Renan was too
28 THE I N NER CITA D EL
much inclined to imagine the philosopher-emperor as a kind of Amiel or
Maurice de Guerin, expressing their worries and sufferings every day.
Following Renan, twentieth-century historians have taken pleasure in
the image of Marcus finding consolation from reality by exhaling his
resignation, pessimism, or resentment into his Meditations.
A strange work
We must try to imagine the state in which the first humanists discovered
the manuscript containing the copy of Marcus Aurelius' book. They
were faced with a work without a title, which began with a list of the
examples or advice which Marcus had received from his parents, his
teachers, his friends, and from the emperor Antoninus Pius, as well as a
list of the favors which the gods had accorded to him. After this enumeration-in
the manuscript, at any rate, which was used for the establishment
of the editio princeps-one could read a note which was both
geographical and chronological in nature: "Written in the land of the
Quades, on the banks of the Gran." Then there came a series of reflections,
several pages long, which sometimes contained divisions, marked
by a paragraph and by capital letters, which do not always correspond to
our modern-day division of the work into chapters. At the beginning of
what we now call chapter III, we find the following indication: "Written
in Carnutum." The reflections then begin again, and continue until the
end of the work. In the Vaticanus, the books are not numbered: the most
this manuscript contains is a two-line separation between what are today
Books I and II; between today's Books II and III; between today's Book
IV and Book V; between today's Book VIII and Book IX; and a dividing
mark between today's Book XI and Book XII. This means that the
divisions between Books III and IV; V and VI; VI and VII; VII and VIII;
and IX and X are not indicated.
Who is responsible for remarks like "in the land of the Quades" or "in
Carnutum?" Was it Marcus himself, who wanted to remind himself of
the circumstances in which a specific group of notes had been written?
Or was it some secretary responsible for preserving the Emperor's documents,
who added a kind of tag to the package that had been entrusted to
him? The first hypothesis is the more likely; but if so it is, I believe,
something unique in the entire history of ancient literature, and well
suited to show to what extent we are dealing with writings recorded day
by day and linked, not perhaps to precise circumstances, but to the
variations in the spiritual state of their author. Did such geographical
A First Glimpse of the Meditations 29
indications exist among the other books, and did they then become lost?
Or was the greater part of the book written at Carnutum? Was it Marcus
himself who gave up supplying such indications? We do not know. Did
the twelve books which we distinguish today correspond to twelve
groups which represented, in the view of their author, sequences of
thoughts having their own unity and different from one another? Or was
this division purely accidental, due, for instance, to the form and dimensions
of the physical materials of Marcus' writing? Again, were the books
separated by an editor, either just after Marcus' death, or by Arethas,
when he produced an edition of the text in the tenth century? We have
seen that the breaks between books, at any rate in the Vaticanus, were
faintly marked, if not nonexistent.
The contents of the work are rather disconcerting as well. After
Book I, which presents an undeniable unity in its evocation of all those,
gods and men, to whom Marcus is expressing his gratitude, the rest of the
work is nothing but a completely incoherent series-at least in appearance-of
reflections which are not even composed in accordance with
the rules of the same literary genre. We encounter many very short
sentences, often quite striking and well written, for example:
Soon you will have forgotten everything, and soon everyone will
have forgotten you (VII, 21).
Everything is ephemeral, that which remembers and that which is
remembered (IV, 3 5).
The best way to get even with them is not to resemble them (VI, 6) .
Alongside these short formulas, we find a certain number of longer
developments, which vary in length from twenty to sixty lines; they may
have the form of a dialogue with a fictitious interlocutor, or of one that
Marcus carries out with himself In them, Marcus exhorts himself to
follow a specific moral attitude, or else he discusses certain general philosophical
problems: if souls survive after death, for instance, where can
they be located (IV, 21)? In most of these passages, whether they are long
or short, Marcus' individuality can scarcely be discerned; most of the
time, we have to do with exhortations addressed to a moral person. We
also find, however, some passages in which Marcus speaks to himself as
an Emperor (VI, 30, 1; VI, 44, 6) ; or in which he speaks of his attitude
toward life at court (V, 16, 2; VI, 12; VIII, 9) ; about the way he must
30 THE I N NER CITADEL
express himselfin the Senate (VIII, 3 0); about his faults (V, 5, l); or about
his entourage (X, 3 6). He also evokes the people he has known in his life
(VIII, 3 7, l; X, 3 l, 1), in imaginatory exercises in the course of which, in
order to prepare himself for death, he represents to himself the fragility of
all things human, and the continuity of the processes of metamorphosis,
which will not spare anyone in his entourage.
In addition to these various literary forms, we must also add two
collections of quotations in Books VII (p-51) and XI (22-3 9) . Borrowed
from the tragedians, Plato, and Epictetus, they have obviously
been chosen for their moral efficacy.
How, then, are we to define this work, which, by its multiple aspects
and unusual tone, seems to be the only example of its genre in all of
antiquity?
The Meditations as personal notes (hypomnemata)
It's time to stop rambling. You will no longer reread the notes
�1ypomnematia) that you had taken, the great deeds of the ancient
Greeks and the Romans, or the extracts from the works you had
been putting aside until your old age (III, 14).
Here we can catch a glimpse of the intellectual activity to which Marcus
devoted himself all his life. Already in his youth, when still the student of
Fronto, he assiduously copied out extracts from Latin authors. 25 He must
later have gone to the trouble of making up "for his old age " an anthology
of edifying quotations, of which we can discover traces in some
pages of the Meditations. He had also put together a historical collection:
"the great deeds of the ancient Greeks and Romans." Finally, Marcus
also speaks of his "personal notes," using the diminutive word hypomnematia.
It has often been suggested that these notes should be identified
with the Meditations.26 It is extremely difficult to give a definitive judgment
on this point; nevertheless, with the help of other ancient parallels,
we can at any rate imagine the way in which the Meditations were
composed.
In the first place, it seems that, as he wrote the Meditations, Marcus
decided to change completely the finality of his literary activity. In
Books II and III, we find numerous allusions both to the imminence of
death weighing upon Marcus, who was then engaged in the military
campaigns of the Danube, and to the urgency of the total conversion he
A First Glimpse of the Meditations 3 1
felt he was about to undergo, and the change in his literary activity which
would be a necessary result of this:
Leave your books alone. Don't let yourself be distracted any longer;
you can't allow yourself that any more (II, 2, 2) .
Throw away your thirst for reading, so that when you die, you will
not be grumbling, but will be in true serenity, thanking the gods
from the bottom of your heart (II, 3, 3).
Marcus is no longer to disperse himself by gathering extracts from
authors in the course of his readings, for he no longer has time to read.
He is no longer, out of intellectual curiosity or speculative interest, to
write great quantities of "note-cards," as we would call them nowadays:
rather, he is to write only in order to influence himself, and concentrate
on the essential principles (II, 3, 3):
Let these thoughts be enough, if they are life-principles (dogmata)
for you.
Marcus, then, is to keep on writing. From now on, however, he will
write only efficacious thoughts: that is, those which totally transform his
way ofliving.
As he wrote these texts, which were to become our Meditations, Marcus
no doubt used these "note-cards" which he was afraid he would no
longer have the time to reread; just as he no doubt had recourse to his
collections of extracts in order to take from them the quotations from
authors which he reproduced in several books of the Meditations.
Formally, then, Marcus' literary activity did not change. He continued
to write down for himself all kinds of notes and reflections (hypomnemata);
but the finality of these intellectual exercises had become completely
modified. From the point of view of the imminence of death, one '
thing counts, and one alone: to strive always to have the essential rules of
life present in one's mind, and to keep placing oneself in the fundamental
disposition of the philosopher, which consists essentially in controlling
one's inner discourse, in doing only that which is of benefit to the
human community, and in accepting the events brought to us by the
course of the Nature of the All.
Thus, the Meditations belong to that type of writing called hypomnemata
in antiquity, which we could define as "personal notes taken on a day-to-
THE I N NER CITADEL
day basis." This was a very widespread practice, and on this point we
have the remarkable testimony of Pamphila, a married woman who lived
at the time of Nero in the first century A.D., who had published her
hypomnemata. In the introduction she had placed at the beginning of this
collection-now unfortunately lost-she tells the reader that, during the
course of thirteen years of married life, which "was not interrupted for a
day nor even for an hour," she noted down what she learned from her
husband, from visitors who came to the house, and from the books she
read. "I wrote them down," she said, "in the form of notes (hypomnemata),
in no special order, and without sorting them out and distinguishing
them according to their subj ect matter. Rather, I wrote them down
at random, in the order in which each matter presented itself to me." She
could, she adds, have ordered them by subject matter with a view to their
publication, but she found variety and the absence of a plan more pleasant
and more graceful. All that she wrote under her own name was an
overall introduction and, apparently, a few transitional passages. The
notes she had gathered together dealt with the lives of philosophers,
history, rhetoric, and poetry. 27
In the following century, the Latin author Aulus Gellius also published
his personal notes, under the title of Attic Nights. In his preface, he writes:
"Whether I was reading a Greek or a Latin book, or whether I had heard
someone say something worthy of being remembered, I jotted down
what interested me, of whatever kind it was, without any order, and I
then set it aside, in order to support my memory [this is the etymological
meaning of hypomnemata] ". The book he is now offering to the public,
he adds, will preserve the same variety and disorder as his notes.28
At the beginning of his treatise On the Tranquillity ef the Soul, Plutarch
explains to the work's addressee that, since he was in a hurry to hand
over his manuscript to the mail-courier who was just about to leave for
Rome, he had not had the time to put together a well-written treatise,
but had merely communicated to him the notes (hypomnemata) that he
had gathered together on this theme.29
It is probable that many educated people-and especially philosophers-were
in the habit of making such collections of all kinds of notes
for their personal use: both in order to inform themselves, and also in
order to form themselves; that is, to ensure their spiritual progress. It was
no doubt with this goal in mind that Plutarch had put together his
collection on the tranquillity of the soul.
This, then, is the genre of writings among which we should place the
Meditations of Marcus Aurelius. It is important to emphasize, however,
A First Glimpse of the Meditations 33
that in his case, most of these notes were exhortations to himself, or a
dialogue with himself, usually composed with the utmost care.
Inner dialogue gave rise to a highly particular literary genre, of which
we know only one written and published example: the Soliloquies of
Augustine. For him the writer's ego is no longer situated-as is often the
case with Marcus-at the level of Reason, exhorting the soul. Rather,
Augustine's ego takes the place of the soul listening to Reason:
For a long time, I had being going over a thousand thoughts in my
mind; indeed, for many days I had been ardently searching for
myself and my good, and for that evil which I had to avoid, when
suddenly I was told (was it I who was speaking, or someone, either
outside me or within me, I do not know; that is precisely what I am
trying with all my strength to find out) ; at any rate, I was told ....
What the voice tells Augustine is that he must write down what it is
going to make known to him. He himself is to write, not dictate, for it is
not fitting to dictate things so intimate: they demand absolute solitude.30
Let us pause for a moment and consider this extremely interesting
remark. Throughout antiquity, authors either wrote themselves, or else
they dictated their works. For instance, we know from Porphyry that
Plotinus wrote his treatises by hand.31 There were many drawbacks to
dictation, as was pointed out by that great user of secretaries, St. Jerome:
" It is one thing to twirl one's pen around in its ink several times before
one writes, and thus to write only that which is worthy of being retained;
but it is another to dictate to a secretary everything that comes into one's
head, for fear of falling silent, because the secretary is waiting. "32
Augustine, however, allows us to glimpse a wholly other point of view:
it is only in the presence of ourselves, he implies, that we can reflect
upon that which is most intimate to us. The presence of another, to
whom one speaks or dictates, instead of speaking to oneself, makes inner
discourse in some way banal and impersonal. This, in all probability, is
why Marcus too wrote his Meditations in his own hand, as he also did in
the case of the letters he wrote to his friends. 33
Tiziano Dorandi34 has recently drawn attention to the variety of stages
leading to the completion of a literary work in antiquity. As a first stage,
the author might compose rough drafts, written on tablets of wax or of
wood. Alternatively, he might, either at the outset or after this stage,
compose a provisional version of his work. Then, in the third stage, came
the definitive revision of the work, which was indispensable before its
34 THE I N NER CITA D EL
final publication. Now, Marcus was clearly writing only for himself, and
we must imagine that he probably never envisaged this third stage. All
our evidence points to the conclusion that Marcus, as he wrote down his
thoughts from day to day, always remained at the first stage. He probably
used tablets (pugillares), or some other medium useful for handwritten
notes, such as leaves (schedae).35 At what point was this material copied
and corrected by a scribe? Possibly during Marcus' lifetime, for his own
personal use. It is also possible, however, and perhaps more probable,
that it was after his death; and on this hypothesis we may imagine,
without having recourse to the destruction postulated by Joly,36 that the
tablets or leaves may not have been copied down in the precise order in
which they were written. It is perhaps not irrelevant in this context that
our Book I, which was in all probability written later and independently
from the others, was placed at the beginning of the collection. N evertheless,
the essential part seems to be in order. Each book is characterized, at
least in part, by a specialized vocabulary and by its emphasis on certain
themes; this allows us to suppose that each book has its own unity, and
was written during a period when the Emperor's attention was concentrated
on a specific question.
Obviously, it is difficult, and even impossible, to obtain a clear idea of
what really happened. We must, it would seem, be content with three
certainties: first of all, the Emperor wrote for himself.37 Second, he wrote
day by day, without attempting to write a unified work, destined for the
public. This is to say that his works remained in the state of hypomnemata
or personal notes, perhaps written on a "mobile " kind of medium like
tablets. In the third place, Marcus took the trouble to write down his
thoughts, aphorisms, and reflections in a highly refined literary form, since it
was precisely the perfection of the formulas which could ensure their
psychological efficacy and persuasive force.
These characteristics suffice to distinguish the personal notes of Marcus
Aurelius from those of Pamphila or of Aulus Gellius, or even from
the " note-cards" assembled by Plutarch in order to compose his treatise
on the tranquillity of the soul-as well as from the notes taken by Arrian
at the classes of Epictetus. It seems, in fact, that unlike these other
hypomnemata, the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius were spiritual exercises,
practiced in accordance with a specific method. We must now explore
what this means.

"Theory" and "practice "
The Meditations have only one theme: philosophy. We can see this from
passages such as the following:
What is it that can escort you in order to protect you in this life?
Only one thing: philosophy. It consists in keeping your inner god
free from pollution and from damage (II, 17, 3).
Be careful of becoming " caesarized" ... Keep yourself simple,
good, pure, grave, natural, a friend of justice. Revere the gods, be
benevolent, affectionate, and firm in accomplishing your duties.
Fight in order to remain as philosophy has wished you to be (VI, 3 0,
r-3).
For the ancients m general, but particularly for the Stoics and for
Marcus Aurelius, philosophy was, above all, a way oflife. This is why the
Meditations strive, by means of an ever-renewed effort, to describe this
way of life and to sketch the model that one must have constantly in
view: that of the ideal good man. Ordinary people are content to think
in any old way, to act haphazardly, and to undergo grudgingly whatever
befalls them. The good man, however, will try, insofar as he is able, to act
justly in the service of other people, to accept serenely those events
which do not depend on him, and to think with rectitude and veracity
(VII, 54):
Always and everywhere, it depends on you piously to be satisfied
with the present conjunction of events,
36 THE I N NER CITADEL
to conduct yourself justly toward whatever other people are present,
and
to apply the rules of discernment to the inner representation you
are having now, so that nothing which is. not objective may infiltrate
its way into you.
Many of the Meditations present these three rules of life-or one or
another of them-in a variety of forms. But these practical rules manifest
a global attitude, a vision of the world, and a fundamental inner choice,
which is expressed in a " discourse," or in universal formulas which
Marcus, following Epictetus,1 calls dogmata (Marcus Aurelius II, 3, 3; III,
I 3, I; IV, 49, 6) . A dogma is a universal principle which founds and
justifies a specific practical conduct, and which can be formulated in one
or in several propositions. Our word " dogma" has, moreover, retained
something of this meaning, for instance in Victor Hugo: "Liberty, Equality,
Fraternity: these are dogmas of peace and of harmony. Why should
we make them seem frightening? "2
In addition to the three rules oflife, then, the Meditations formulate, in
every possible way, those dogmas which express, in discursive form, the
indivisible inner disposition that manifests itself in the three rules of
action.
Marcus himself gives us good examples of the relationship between
general principles and rules of life. We have seen that one of the rules of
life he proposes consists in consenting with serenity to events willed by
Destiny, which do not depend on us. But he also exhorts himself, in the
following terms (IV, 49, 6) :
On the occasion of everything that causes you sadness, remember to
use this " dogma ": not only is this not a misfortune, but it is a piece
of good fortune for you to bear up under it courageously.
This dogma is deduced from the fundamental dogma of Stoicism,
which is the foundation for all Stoic behavior: only moral good, or
virtue, is a good, and only moral evil, or vice, is an evil.3 Marcus formulates
this explicitly elsewhere (VIII, I, 6) :
What does happiness consist of? It consists of doing that which the
nature of mankind desires. How shall we do this? By possessing
those dogmas which are the principles of impulses and of action.
Which dogmas? Those which pertain to the distinction of what is
The Meditations as Spiritual Exercises
good from what is bad: there is no good for mankind but that which
renders him just, temperate, courageous and free, and there is no
evil for mankind, except that which brings about in him the contrary
vices.
3 7
Marcus also employs the word theorema to designate the " dogmas,"
inasmuch as every art entails principles, and consequently so too does
that art of living called philosophy (XI, 5):
What art do you practice? That of being good. How can you
practice this except by starting out from theorems, some of which
concern the Nature of the All, and others of which deal with the
constitution proper to mankind?
Dogmas, as Marcus says (VII, 2) , run the risk of dying out, if one does
not constantly reignite those inner images, or phantasiai, which make
them present to us.
Thus, we can say that the Meditations-with the exception of
Book I-are wholly made up of the repeated, ever-renewed formulation
of the three rules of action which we have just seen, and of the various
dogmas which are their foundation.
Dogmas and their formulation
These dogmas, or foundational and fundamental rules, were the subject
of demonstrations within the Stoic schools. Marcus learned such demonstrations
from his Stoic teachers Junius Rusticus, Apollonius, and Sextus,
to whom he renders homage in the first book of the Meditations. Above
all, he read about them in the Discourses of Epictetus as collected by
Arrian. In his Meditations, Marcus mentions "the large number of proofs
by which it is demonstrated that the world is like a City," or else the
teachings he has received on the subject of pleasure and pain, and to
which he has given his assent (IV, 3, 5, 6) .
With the aid of these demonstrations, the dogmas imposed themselves
upon Marcus with absolute certainty, and he usually restricts himself to
formulating them in the form of a simple proposition, as he does in
Book II, r, 3. The nature of the good, he says there, is moral good (to
kalon); while that of evil is moral evil (to aischron). This condensed form is
sufficient to evoke the theoretical demonstration of which they were the
subject, and it allows the inner disposition which was a result of his clear
THE I N NER CITADEL
view of these principles-that is, the resolution to do good-to be reawakened
within his soul. To repeat the dogmas to oneself, or write
them down for oneself, is " to retreat," as Marcus says (IV, 3, 1) , "not to
the countryside, the seashore, or the mountains," but within oneself It is
there that one can find the formulas "which shall renew us." "Let them
be concise and essential," Marcus continues, in order that their efficacy
be complete. This is why, in order to be ready to apply the three rules of
action, Marcus sometimes gathers together a series of chapter-heads
(kephalaia), extremely brief in form, which constitute an enumeration of
points which, by their very accumulation, can increase their psychic
efficacy (II, 1; IV, 3; IV, 26; VII, 22, 2; VIII, 21, 2; XI, 18; XII, 7; XII, 8;
XII, 26) . I cannot quote these lists in their entirety, but I shall take one
example (XII, 26) in which eight kephalaia, or fundamental points, provide
a group of resources with a view to the practice of that rule of action
which prescribes that we must serenely accept that which happens to us,
but does not depend on our will:
If you are annoyed at something, it is because you have forgotten:
(1) that everything happens in accordance with universal Nature;
(2) that whatever fault was committed is not your concern;
(3) and, moreover, that everything that happens has always happened
thus and will always happen thus, and is, at this very moment,
happening thus everywhere;
(4)how close is the relationship between man and the whole
human race: for this is no community of blood or of seed, but of the
intellect.
You have also forgotten:
(s)that the intellect of each person is God, and that it has flowed
down here from above;
(6) and that nothing belongs to any of us in the strict sense, but
that our child, our body and our soul come from above;
(7)and that everything is a judgment-value;
(8) and the only thing each of us lives and loses is the present.
All the points presented here in the form of a laconic aide-memoire,
which does nothing but evoke demonstrations with which Marcus is
familiar from elsewhere, can be found separated from one another
throughout the Meditations: they are repeated, ruminated upon; but also
explained and sometimes demonstrated. If we assemble these series of
kephalaia (II, 1; IV, 3; IV, 26; VII, 22, 2; VIII, 21, 2; XI, 1 8; XII, 7; XII,
The Meditations as Spiritual Exercises 39
8; XII, 26) we can thus discover almost all the themes announced or
developed in the Meditations. By connecting them to the most fundamental
dogmas of Stoicism, we can present, in a structured form, the
whole ensemble of doctrines which constitute the essential core of the
Meditations.
From the absolutely primary principle according to which the only
good is moral good and the only evil is moral evil (II, 1, 3), it follows that
neither pleasure nor pain are evils (IV, 3, 6; XII, 8); that the only thing
shameful is moral evil (II, 1, 3); that faults committed against us cannot
touch us (II, 1, 3; XII, 26) ; that he who commits a fault hurts only
himself (IV, 26, 3); and that the fault cannot be found elsewhere than
within oneself (VII, 29, 7; XII, 26) . It further follows that I can suffer no
harm whatsoever from the actions of anyone else (II, 1, 3; VII, 22, 2) .
From the general principles
1. only that which depends on us can be either good or evil; and
2. our judgment and our assent depend on us (XII, 22) ,
it follows that the only evil or trouble there can be for us resides in our
own judgment; that is to say, in the way we represent things to ourselves
(IV, 3, 10; XI, 18, I I); and that people are the authors of their own
problems (IV, 26, 2; XII, 8) . Everything, therefore, is a matter of judgment
(XII, 8; XII, 22; XII, 26) . The intellect is independent of the body
(IV, 3, 6) , and things do not come inside us in order to trouble us (IV, 3,
10) . If everything is a matter of judgment, every fault is in fact a false
judgment, and proceeds from ignorance (II, 1, 2; IV, 3, 4; XI, 1 8 , 4-5).
In the enumeration of kephalaia in Book XI (XI, 1 8 , 2) , Marcus tells
himself:
Go higher up still, starting from the principle that if we reject
atoms, it must be Nature which governs the All.
In the list in Book IV, he says:
Remember the disjunction: either providence or atoms.
These brief mentions of a principle, which it is assumed is known,
allow us to glimpse that Marcus is here again alluding to teachings he has
received, which placed face to face the Epicurean position (atoms) and
the Stoic position (Nature and providence) , to conclude in favor of the
40 THE INNER CITADEL
latter. I shall return to this point. For the moment, suffice it to say that
from the dogma that affirms a unity and rationality of the world, many
consequences may be drawn, to which Marcus alludes in his series of
kephalaia. Everything comes from universal Nature and in conformity
with the will of universal Nature (XII, 26)-even the malevolence of
mankind (XI, 18, 24), which is a necessary consequence of the gift of
liberty. Everything occurs in conformity with Destiny (IV, 26, 4) : thus, it
is in conformity with the order of the universe that all things undergo
continuous metamorphosis (IV, 3, II; XII, 21), but are also ceaselessly
repeated (XII, 26) , and that we must die (IV, 3, 4; XI, 18, r n) . Universal
Reason gives form and energy to matter that is docile, but without
strength; this is why we must always and everywhere distinguish the
causal (reason) and the material (XII, 8; XII, 1 8). It is from universal
Reason that comes that reason which is common to all mankind and
assures its relatedness, which is not a community of blood or of seed
(II, 1, 3; XII, 26) . This is why people are made for one another (II, 1, 4;
IV, 3, 4; XI, 18, 1-2) .
One last series of kephalaia can be grouped around the grandiose vision
of the immensity of universal Nature, and the infinity of space and of
time (IV, 3, 7; XII, 7) . From this perspective, the whole of life seems to
be of minuscule duration (VIII, 21, 2; IV, 26, 5; XII, 7) ; the instant seems
infinitesimal (II, 14, 3; XII, 26) ; the earth seems like a point (IV, 3, 8;
VIII, 21, 2) ; current fame and posthumous glory seem completely vain
(IV, 3, 8; VIII, 21, 3; XII, 21; IV, 3, 7) , all the more so since they can only
be obtained from people who contradict themselves and each other
(IV, 3, 8; VII, 21, 3), and whom one cannot respect, if one sees them as
they really are (XI, 1 8, 3).
All these " dogmas" can, then, be deduced from more fundamental
dogmas. Yet they all become crystallized around the three rules or disciplines
oflife, which we have distinguished. The discipline of thought, for
example, obviously presupposes the dogmas which concern freedom of
judgment; the discipline of action presupposes those which affirm the
existence of a community of reasonable beings; and the discipline of
consent to events presupposes the dogma of the providence and rationality
of the universe. We can glimpse a similar grouping in IV, 3.
Lists of kephalaia or fundamental points: such is the first mode of
formulation of dogmas in the Meditations. Yet these fundamental points
are also taken up by themselves and frequently repeated throughout the
course of the work. Thus the invitation, formulated in one of the series
of kephalaia (XII, 8), to discern what is causal in each thing, is repeated
The Meditations as Spiritual Exercises 41
eight times in isolated form, without any commentary or explanation, in
the body of the Meditations (IV, 21, 5; VII, 29, 5; VIII, u; IX, 25; IX, 37;
XII, r n; XII, 18; XII, 29) . Likewise, the affirmation "All is judgment,"
which figures in two lists of kephalaia (XII, 8 and XII, 26) is found twice
by itself, either without commentary or accompanied by a very brief
explanation (II, 15; XII, 22) . Above all, the dogma according to which
our troubles come only from our judgments, and that things do not
penetrate within us (IV, 3, 1 o) , recurs eighteen times in the course of the
Meditations, sometimes repeated almost word for word, and sometimes in
slightly different form (V, 19; VI, 52; VII, 2; VIII, 47; IX, 13; IX, 15; XI,
1 1 ; XI, 16; XII, 22; XII, 25; IV, 7; IV, 39, 2; V, 2; VII, 14; VII, 1 6; VIII,
29; VIII, 40; VIII, 49) .
Let us now consider another theme which we have encountered in
the series of kephalaia: that of the eternal repetition of all things both in
universal Nature and in human history (XII, 26, 3). This, too, is a point
which is dear to Marcus, and which he goes over indefatigably. It does
not matter, he writes, whether one attends the spectacle of the world for
a short or a long time, since the totality of being is present at each instant
and in each thing. All things are thus homoeideis; that is, they have the
same content, and therefore repeat themselves infinitely.
From all eternity, all things have identical contents, and pass
through the same cycles (II, 14, 1).
Everything is of the same kind, and of identical contents (VI, 3 7) .
From all eternity, all things are produced with identical contents,
and for all infinity there will be other things of this kind (IX, 3 5) .
In a sense, a man of forty-if he is not devoid of intelligence-has
seen all that has been and all that shall be, once he recognizes that all
things have identical contents (XI, 1, 3).
It would be tedious to cite other examples of the many repetitions
which one finds all throughout the work. It suffices to note that most of
the Meditations take up again-often in a highly elaborate and striking
form-these various kephalaia and dogmas, the list of which Marcus gives
us several times in the course of his work.
It is, however, not enough to "retreat," returning frequently to these
dogmas to reorient one's actions; after all, in the art ofliving, we must do
42 THE I N NER CITADEL
nothing which is not m conformity "with the theorems of the art"
(IV, 2) . Rather, we must often return to their theoretical foundations.
Marcus clearly explains this need, in a passage which has been misunderstood
by many interpreters (X, 9) . Within it, we must distinguish two
different lines of thought. The first is a concentrated and brutal description
of the unhappiness of the human condition, when it is not guided by
reason:
Buffoonery and bloody struggles; torpor and agitation; the slavery
of every day!4
Then there comes another thought, completely independent from the
first, which has to do with the importance of theory:
All your fine sacred dogmas, which you think without founding
them on a science of Nature, and then abandon: they will disappear
rapidly. From now on, you must see and practice everything, so that
that which is required by the present circumstances is accomplished,
but, at the same time, the theoretical foundation of your actions is
always present in an efficacious way, and that you always maintain
within yourself-latent, but not buried-that self-confidence
which is procured by science, applied to each particular case.
We must, then, not only act in conformity with the theorems of the
art of living and the fundamental dogmas, but also keep present to our
consciousness the theoretical foundations which justify them. This is
what Marcus means by the "science of Nature," because, in the final
analysis, all oflife's principles merge in the knowledge ofNature.5 Without
this, the formulations of dogmas will become devoid of sense, no
matter how often they are repeated.
This is why Marcus uses a third method of formulating dogmas. Here
the technique involves reconstructing the arguments used to justify
them, or even reflecting upon the difficulties to which they may give
rise. For instance, Marcus alludes, without citing them, to all the proofs
which demonstrate that the world is like a City (IV, 3, 5); and this
formula entailed a quite specific attitude vis-a-vis events and other people.
Elsewhere, however, he bases this formula on a complex series of
rationalizations, and we can summarize the sorites he constructs as follows:
a city is a group ofbeings subject to the same laws. Now, the world
is a group ofbeings subject to the same laws: the law of Reason. There-
The Meditations as Spiritual Exercises 43
fore, the world is a City (IV, 4) . This reasoning was traditional in Stoicism;
traces of it can be found, for example, in Cicero. 6 Yet elsewhere,
Marcus remarks that we must imbibe our spirit with the help of reasoning-that
is, the linkages between representations (V, 1 6, l)-and he
proposes further demonstrations, one of which also has the form of a
sorites.
This theoretical work does not, however, consist solely in reproducing
a simple series of reasonings. It may take on several forms: either that of
literary or rhetorical-sounding developments, or of more technical discussions
concerning aporiai. The dogma according to which "Everything
happens in conformity with universal Nature " (XII, 26, l), for instance,
is presented in what one might call a highly orchestrated manner in V, 8,
as well as in VII, 9:
All things are linked together mutually, and their linkage is sacred.
Nothing, so to speak, is foreign to anything else, for everything is
coordinated and everything contributes to the order of one single
world. One single world is the result of all things, and one single
God penetrates throughout them all; there is one single substance,
and one single law which is the Reason common to all intelligent
beings; there is one truth.
This theme of the unity of the world, based on the unity of its origin,
is often repeated in analogous terms (VI, 38; XII, 29) ; but it is also
discussed critically, sometimes in schematic fashion, but at other times in
a more diluted way, particularly in the numerous passages in which we
find what Marcus calls the " disjunction": either atoms (that is, Epicurean
dispersion) , or one Nature (Stoic unity; c£ IV, 27; VI, 1 0; VI, 44; VII, 75;
VIII, 18; IX, 28; IX, 39; X, 6-7) .
Many other major points are discussed in comparatively long developments:
for instance, the mutual attraction that reasonable beings feel for
one another, which explains that people are made for one another (IX,
9) ; or the dogma that nothing can constitute an obstacle for intellect or
reason (X, 3 3).
The three rules of life or disciplines
As we have seen, practical conduct obeys three rules of life which determine
the individual's relationship to the necessary course of Nature, to
other people, and to his own thought. As in the case of his exposition of
44 THE I N NER CITADEL
the dogmas, Marcus' exposition of these rules is highly structured. The
three rules of life or discipline correspond to the three activities of the
soul: judgment, desire, and impulse; and to the three domains of reality:
our individual faculty of judgment, universal Nature, and human nature.
This can be seen in the following diagram:
activity
(1) judgment
(2) desire
(3) impulse toward action
domain ef reality
faculty of judgment
universal Nature
human Nature
inner attitude
obj ectivity
consent to Destiny
justice and altruism
We encounter this ternary model very frequently throughout the
Meditations. I shall cite a few important passages:
Always and everywhere, it depends on you
-piously to rejoice in the present conjunction of events (2) ;
-to conduct yourself with justice toward whatever people are
present (3);
-to apply the rules of discernment to your present representation
(1), so that nothing nonobj ective may infiltrate its way in (VII, 54).
The following are enough for you:
-your present value-judgment (1), as long as it is objective;
-your present action (3), as long as it is accomplished in the service
of the human community;
-your present inner disposition (2), as long as it finds its joy in
every conjunction of events brought about by the external cause
(IX, 6) .
Reasonable nature is indeed following its proper path
-if, with regard to its representations (1) , it gives its assent neither to
what is false, nor to what is obscure;
-if it directs its impulses (3) only toward those actions which serve
the human community;
-if it has desire (2) and aversion only for that which depends on us;
while it joyfully greets all that which is granted to it by universal
Nature (VIII, 7) .
Again,
The Meditations as Spiritual Exercises 45
Erase your representation (phantasia) (I);
Stop your impulse toward action (horme) (3)
Extinguish your desire (orexis) (2);
Have your guiding principle (hegemonikon) within your power
(IX, 7) .
What must you practice?
One thing only:
-thought devoted to justice and actions accomplished in the service
of the community (3);
-speech which can never deceive ( I ) ;
-an inner disposition (2) which lovingly greets each conjunction of
events, recognizing it as necessary, familiar, and flowing forth from
so great a principle, and so great a source (IV, 33, 3).
In addition to these explicit fommlations, we find numerous allusions to
the three disciplines, in various forms. Thus, Marcus lists as a triad of
virtues: "truth," "justice," and "temperance" (XII, 1 5); or "unhurriedness
in judgment," "love of people," and "the disposition to place oneselfin
the cortege of the gods" (III, 9, 2)-which correspond to the three
rules of life. It sometimes happens that only two or even only one of the
disciplines appears, as for instance in IV, 22:
To accomplish justice on the occasion of each impulse toward
action, and, on the occasion of each representation, retain only that
part of it which exactly corresponds to reality (here we can recognize
the disciplines of action and of judgment) .
In X, I I , 3:
He is content with two things: to accomplish the present action
with justice, and to love the fate which has, here and now, been
allotted to him.
And again, in VIII, 23:
Am I accomplishing some action? I accomplish it, relating it to the
well-being of mankind. Is something happening to me? I greet it,
relating what happens to me to the gods and to the source of all
THE I N NER CITADEL
things, whence is formed the framework of events (here we recognize
the disciplines of action and of desire) .
Often, only one theme is evoked, as for instance the discipline of
desire (VII, 57):
Love only the event which comes upon us, and which is linked to
us by Destiny.
or the discipline of judgment (IV, 7) :
Suppress the value-judgment (which you add) , and the "I've been
hurt" is also suppressed. Suppress the "I've been hurt," and the
harm is suppressed.
or, finally, the discipline of impulses (XII, 20) :
In the first place: nothing at random, and nothing unrelated to some
goal or end. Second, don't relate your actions to anything except an
end or goal which serves the human community.
The Meditations, then, take up the various dogmas one by one, either
briefly or in more developed form, and different chapters give longer lists
of them than others. Likewise, they tirelessly repeat, either concisely or
in more extended form, the formulation of the three rules of life, which
can be found gathered together in their entirety in certain chapters. As
we shall see, Book III attempts to give a detailed, ideal portrait of the
good man, and the three rules of life, which correspond precisely to the
good man's behavior, are set forth in great detail. On the other hand, we
can also find the three rules of life-mixed together with other related
exhortations-presented in a form so concise that it makes them almost
enigmatic :
Erase this representation [discipline of judgment] .
Stop dancing around like a puppet [discipline of action] .
Circumscribe the precise moment of time.
Recognize what is happening to you or to someone else [discipline
of the consent to Destiny] .
Divide the object and analyze it into " causal" and "material."
Think about your last hour.
The Meditations as Spiritual Exercises
As for the wrong committed by so-and-so: leave it right where
the fault was committed (VII, 29) .
47
These three disciplines of life are the true key to the Meditations of
Marcus Aurelius, for the various dogmas I have discussed crystallize
around them. The dogmas affirming our freedom of judgment, and the
possibility for mankind to criticize and modify his own thought, are
linked to the discipline of judgment, while all the theorems on the
causality of universal Nature are grouped around that discipline which
directs our attitude toward external events. Finally, the discipline of
action is fed by all the theoretical propositions concerning the mutual
attraction which unites rational beings.
In the last analysis, we realize that behind their apparent disorder, we
can discern a highly rigorous conceptual system in Marcus' Meditations. I
shall now turn to a detailed description of its structure.
Imaginative exercises
The Meditations do not just formulate the rules of life and the dogmas by
which they are nourished; for it is not only reason which is exercised in
them, but the imagination as well. For example, Marcus does not restrict
himself to saying that life is short and that we all must soon die, by virtue
of the laws of metamorphosis imposed by Nature. Instead, he brings to
life before his eyes (VIII, 3 1)
the court of Augustus; his wife, his daughter, his descendants, his
progeny, his sister, Agrippa, his relatives, his acquaintances, his
friends Arius and Maecenas, his doctors, his sacrificers, the death of
an entire Court ...
Yet it is not only the disappearance of a court that he tries to represent
to himself, but that of a whole generation (IV, 32):
For instance, imagine the time of Vespasian. You'll see all of that:
people getting married, raising a family, falling ill, dying, going to
war, celebrating festivals, doing business, working the fields; there'll
be flatterers, arrogant or suspicious people, conspirators; there'll be
people who desire the death of others; others who grumble about
present events; there'll be lovers, misers, others who lust after con-
THE I N NER CITADEL
sulate or kingship. That life of theirs: is it not true that it is nowhere
now?
At other times, Marcus thinks of the great men of the past: Hippocrates,
Alexander, Pompey, Caesar, Augustus, Hadrian, Heraclitus,
Democritus, Socrates, Eudoxus, Hipparchus, and Archimedes. "All of
them long dead!" he writes (VI, 47) ; " No more and nowhere!" (VIII, 5) .
By so doing, Marcus takes his place in the great literary tradition which,
from Lucretius to Franc;:ois Villon,7 has evoked the famous dead: "Where
are the snows of yesteryear?" "Where are they?" Marcus had already
asked (X, 31, 2) ; "Nowhere; no matter where!"
Such imaginative exercises recur rather often in the Meditations (IV, 50;
VI, 24; VII, 19, 2; VII, 48; VIII, 25; VIII, 3 7; IX, 3 0; XII, 27) . It is by this
means that Marcus attempts vigorously to place the dogma of universal
metamorphosis before his eyes.
Life itself, however, is a kind of death, when it is not illuminated by
virtue, by the practice of the rules oflife, and by the knowledge of those
dogmas which provide knowledge of things human and divine. This is
what explains those descriptions of the vanity of human life-worthy of
a Cynic-which we sometimes find in the Meditations, as in the following
extraordinary passage (VII, 3):
The vain solemnity of a procession; dramas played out on the stage;
troops of sheep or goats; fights with spears; a little bone thrown to
dogs; a chunk of bread thrown into a fish-pond; the exhausting
labor and heavy burdens under which ants must bear up; crazed
mice running for shelter; puppets pulled by strings ....
And we have already encountered the following brief but striking note
(X, 9) :
Buffoonery and bloody struggles; torpor and agitation; the slavery
of every day.
Writing as a spiritual exercise
As we have seen throughout these analyses, the Meditations appear to be
variations on a small number of themes. The result of this is the large
number of repetitions they contain, which are sometimes almost verba-
The Meditations as Spiritual Exercises 49
tim. We have already encountered several examples of this, and the
following ones can be added:
How could that which does not make a man worse, make life
worse? (II, I I, 4)
That which does not make a man worse than he is, does not make
his life worse, either .... (IV, 8) .
All is ephemeral: that which remembers, and that which it remembers
(IV, 3 5).
Ephemeral ... is he who remembers and that which he remembers
(VIII, 21, 2) .
Nothing is so capable of producing greatness of soul (III, I I, 2) .
Nothing is so capable of producing greatness of soul (X, I I, I ) .
Many more examples could be cited, including long developments such
as VIII, 34 and XI, 8, both of which are structurally parallel, and are
devoted to the power which man has received from God to reunite
himself with the All from which he has separated himself.
The advice on distinguishing within each thing " that which is causal"
from "that which is material" is repeated almost ten times, with only very
slight variations. Here we can recognize one of the fundamental structures
of Stoic physics,8 and therefore-once again-the technical nature
of the formulas Marcus uses. But Marcus does not merely repeat this
distinction as if he were reproducing something he had learned in a Stoic
school; for him, it has an existential meaning. To distinguish the causal
element is to recognize the presence within oneself of the hegemonikon,
that is, the principle which directs all being. This is that principle of
thought and judgn1ent which makes us independent of the body, and the
principle of liberty which delimits the sphere of "that which depends on
us," as opposed to "that which does not depend on us."
Marcus does not say this; however, we can deduce it from the overall
structure of his system. He is content merely to recommend to himself to
apply this distinction, without ever giving an example which might help
us to understand what this exercise might mean. The reason is that
Marcus has no need of examples; he knows perfectly well what he's
50 THE I N NER CITADEL
talking about. These formulas, which are repeated throughout the Meditations,
never set forth a doctrine. Rather, they serve only as a catalyst
which, by means of the association of ideas, reactivates a series of representations
and practices, about which Marcus-since he is writing only
for himself-has no need to go into detail.
Marcus writes only in order to have the dogmas and rules oflife always
present to his mind. He is thus following the advice of Epictetus, who,
after having set forth the distinction between what does and does not
depend on us-the fundamental dogma of Stoicism-adds:
It is about this that philosophers ought to meditate; this is what they
should write down every day, and it should be the subject of their
exercises (I, I, 25) .
You must have these principles at hand (procheira) both night and
day; you must write them down; you must read them (III, 24, 103) .
The Stoic philosophical life consists essentially in mastering one's inner
discourse. Everything in an individual's life depends on how he
represents things to himself-in other words, how he tells them to himself
in inner dialogue. " It is not things that trouble us," as Epictetus said
(Manual, §5), "but our judgments about things," in other words, our
inner discourse about things. I will have a great deal to say later on about
the Discourses of Epictetus, which were collected by his disciple Arrian.
They depict Epictetus speaking with his students during his philosophy
classes, and, as Arrian says in his brief preface, "When he spoke, he
certainly had no other desire than to set the thoughts of his listeners in
motion toward what is best ... when Epictetus spoke these words, his
audience could not help feeling just what this man wanted them to feel."
Epictetus' speech, then, was intended to modify his audience's inner
discourse. We are thus in the presence of two therapies: one was that of
the word, practiced in a variety of forms, by means of striking or moving
formulas and with the help oflogical and technical rational processes, but
also with the help of seductive and persuasive imagery. Another was the
therapy of writing for oneself, which, for Marcus, consisted in taking up
the dogmas and rules of action as they were stated by Epictetus-all the
while addressing himself-and assimilating them, so that they might become
the principles of his inner discourse. Therefore, one must constantly
rekindle the "representations " (phantasiai) within oneself, in other
words, those discourses which formulate dogmas (VII, 2) .
The Meditations as Spiritual Exercises 51
Such writing exercises thus lead necessarily to incessant repetitions,
and this is what radically differentiates the Meditations from every other
work. Dogmas are not mathematical rules, learned once and for all and
then mechanically applied. Rather, they must somehow become
achievements of awareness, intuitions, emotions, and moral experiences
which have the intensity of a mystical experience or a vision. This
spiritual and affective spirituality is, however, quick to dissipate. In order
to reawaken it, it is not enough to reread what has already been written.
Written pages are already dead, and the Meditations were not made to be
reread. What counts is the reformulation: the act of writing or talking to
oneself, right now, in the very moment when one needs to write. It is
also the act of composing with the greatest care possible: to search for
that version which, at a given moment, will produce the greatest effect,
in the moment before it fades away, almost instantaneously, almost as
soon as it is written. Characters traced onto some medium do not fix
anything: everything is in the act of writing. Thus, we witness a succession
of new attempts at composition, repetitions of the same formulas,
and endless variations on the same themes: the themes of Epictetus.
The goal is to reactualize, rekindle, and ceaselessly reawaken an inner
state which is in constant danger of being numbed or extinguished. The
task-ever-renewed-is to bring back to order an inner discourse which
becomes dispersed and diluted in the futility of routine.
As he wrote the Meditations, Marcus was thus practicing Stoic spiritual
exercises. He was using writing as a technique or procedure in order to
influence himself, and to transform his inner discourse by meditating on
the Stoic dogmas and rules oflife. This was an exercise of writing day by
day, ever-renewed, always taken up again and always needing to be taken
up again, since the true philosopher is he who is conscious of not yet
having attained wisdom.
" Greek" exercises
It is not surprising to the modern reader that the Meditations were written
in Greek. One might, however, wonder why the Emperor, whose
mother tongue was Latin, chose to use Greek to write personal notes
intended only for himself
First of all, we must note that Marcus was completely bilingual, having
studied Greek rhetoric with Heracles Atticus and Latin rhetoric with
Fronto. More generally, the population of Rome was made up of the
most diverse elements, who had converged upon the Empire's metropo-
52 THE I N NER CITADEL
lis for a wide variety of reasons, and the two languages were in constant
use. In the streets of Rome, the Greek doctor Galen could rub elbows
with the Christian apologist Justin, or else with some Gnostic. All these
figures taught in Rome and had students from the educated classes.9
Even in Rome, Greek was the language of philosophy. The rhetorician
Quintillian, writing at the end of the first century A.D., notes that
few Latin writers had ever dealt with philosophy: he cites only Cicero,
Brutus, Seneca, and a few others. He could also have included the name
of Lucretius. Be that as it may, in the first century A.D. Cornutus,
Musonius Rufus, and Epictetus all wrote in Greek, which allows us to
infer that, from then on, educated Romans accepted that even in Rome,
the official language of philosophy should be Greek.
One might have thought that Marcus would have preferred to talk to
himself in Latin. As we have seen, however, the Meditations are not
spontaneous effusions, but exercises carried out in accordance with a
program which Marcus had received from the Stoic tradition, and in
particular from Epictetus. Marcus was working with pre-existing materials,
and painting on a canvas given him by someone else. This fact entails
several consequences.
In the first place, this philosophical material was associated with a
technical vocabulary, and the Stoics, in particular, were renowned for the
technical nature of their terminology. Translators must, by the way, be
aware of this peculiarity of Marcus' vocabulary, and pay the closest possible
attention when they encounter such words as hypolepsis ("value-judgment")
; kataleptikos (" objective "; " adequate ") ; phantasia ("representation,"
not "imagination"), hegemonikon ("directing principle ") ;
epakolouthesis ("necessary but nonessential consequence") ; and hypexairesis
("reserve clause") , to cite only a few examples. Such technicalities go
to show that Marcus was no amateur, and that it was not the case that
Stoicism was just "a religion" for him.10
It was difficult to translate these terms into Latin. It could be said that
Lucretius, Cicero, and Seneca had done quite well when faced with the
same kind of challenge. But the goal of these authors was popularization:
they wanted to make Greek philosophy accessible to a Latin audience.
Marcus' project was different: he was writing for himself To translate or
to adapt terminology would distract him from his goal. What is more, if
they were translated into Latin, the technical terms of Greek philosophy
would lose a part of their meaning. In the same way, when Aulus Gellius,
11 a contemporary of Marcus who had studied philosophy at Athens,
translates a passage from the Discourses of Epictetus as reported by Arrian,
The Meditations as Spiritual Exercises 53
he feels obliged to transcribe technical Greek words, in order to explain
his choice of the Latin words which he has chosen to correspond to
them. Modern translators of Heidegger are often forced to do the same.
In the final analysis, philosophy, like poetry, is untranslatable.
In any case, Marcus had no time to indulge in the literary work of
translation. In the urgency of conversion and the imminence of death, he
searched for immediate effects: words and phrases which would dissipate
worry or anger immediately (IV, 3, 3). He felt the need to plunge back
into the atmosphere of philosophical instruction, and to remember the
exact phraseology of Epictetus, which supplied him with the themes
upon which he developed his variations.

THE PHILO S O PHER-SLAV E AND
THE EMPERO R -PHI LOSO PHER
Memories of philosophical readings
Some quotations from philosophers appear occasionally in the Meditations.1
It is possible that Marcus may have read some of these authors, but
he may also have come across them in the course of his Stoic readings.
The Stoics considered Heraclitus, for instance, as their great ancestor. 2
Several passages from the Ephesian philosopher appear in the Meditations,
but it is difficult to distinguish the authentic passages from the paraphrases
which the Emperor gives of them, perhaps because he is quoting them
from memory. It is possible that Marcus' allusion to "people who speak
and act while asleep," and thus live in a state of unconsciousness (IV, 46,
4) , is only a development of the first fragment of Heraclitus, which also
alluded to the unconsciousness of the majority of mankind, analogous to
sleep.3
At any rate, the theme of the sleep of unconsciousness made a deep
impression on Marcus. He makes a possible allusion to the Heraclitean
fragment4 which speaks of a person so drunk he no longer knows where
he is going: "he who forgets where the road leads," as Marcus puts it (IV,
46, 2) . More significantly, Marcus affirms-still under the inspiration of
Heraclitus5-that those who are asleep and unconscious also contribute,
in their own way, to the fabrication of the world, and he draws from this
the following conclusion (VI, 42, 1) :
We are all working together in order to complete one work; some
of us knowingly and consciously, and the others unconsciously.
Thus, even when we oppose ourselves to the will of universal Reason,
each of us collaborates with it, for the course of Nature also has need of
those who refuse to follow it. After all, Nature has integrated freedom
The Philosopher-Slave and the Emperor-Philosopher 55
into her plan, as well as all that it implies: including unconsciousness or
resistance. In the drama which Nature makes us play, sleepers and opponents
are precisely what she has to foresee.
For these people, asleep or unconscious, who are "in discord with the
logos"6 (IV, 46, 3), "what they encounter every day seems foreign to
them"7 (IV, 46, 3). It could be that this Heraclitean theme was all the
more dear to Marcus because of the great importance he attached to the
notion of "familiarity" with Nature, and therefore with the logos. It is this
familiarity which allows us to recognize as familiar or natural, and not
foreign, all those events which occur by the will of Nature (III, 2, 6) .
The death of the elements into one another-an eminently Heraclitean
theme-could not fail to attract the Emperor's attention (IV, 46,
1); after all, Stoicism had accustomed him to meditate upon universal
metamorphosis.9
Together with Heraclitus we find Empedocles, one of whose verses
Marcus cites (XII, 3). The "pure-orbed" Sphairos which this poetphilosopher
had imagined was the traditional model for the Sage. 10
Without naming its author, Marcus quotes and criticizes (IV, 24) a
fragment of Democritus which advises people not to get involved in too
many things, if they want to keep their peace of mind. In fact, among
those authors-especially Stoics-who dealt with this virtue, it was a
tradition to refuse the Democritean invitation to inaction. 11
In the collection entitled "The Sentences of Democratus," sometimes
attributed to Democritus, 12 Marcus found an aphorism which, one could
say, sums up his own thought (IV, 3, r I ) :
The world is nothing but metamorphosis (alloiosis), and life is nothing
but an opinion (or a judgment: hypolepsis) .
In this formulation, Marcus no doubt recognized Epictetus' idea according
to which it is not things that trouble us, but the representations and
judgments which we make about them (Manual, §5) .
Elsewhere (VII, 3 r , 4), Marcus criticizes another Democritean text,
which affirmed that true reality consists of atoms and the void, and that
everything else was only "by convention" (nomisti). As Galen explains,13
this meant that "in itself, " there is nothing but atoms; but that "with
regard to us," there is a whole world of colors, odors, and tastes, which
we assume is real, but which in fact is only subjective. Marcus corrects
the Democritean formula, but interprets it in a Stoic sense. He denies the
infinite number of atoms which, on this theory, are the only real princi-
THE I N NER CITADEL
ples, but he admits the word nomisti, on the condition that it be understood
not in the sense of "by convention," but as if it meant "by a law."
For Marcus, then, only half of Democritus' formula is true: "Everything
is nomisti. " Its meaning, however, is that " everything happens by the
law," that is, the law of universal Nature. The other part of Democritus'
formula, which asserted that the true reality is the multiplicity of atoms
which constitute the principles, is false; for if everything comes about by
the laws of Nature, then the number of principles is quite restricted. In
fact, it is reduced to one: the logos; or to two: the logos and matter. Such,
at least, is one interpretation of this difficult and probably corrupt text. 14
One might also consider that Marcus understands "Everything is nomisti"
in the same sense as the sentence of Democritus cited above: "Everything
is subjective; that is, everything is judgment." In other words, Marcus
may have understood it in the light of Epictetus' idea that everything is in
our representations.15 This does not mean that we do not know reality,
but that we attribute to it values of good or of evil which have no basis in
reality.
Marcus also thinks he recognizes this doctrine in the formula of a
Cynic (II, 1 5):
"Everything is matter of judgment." No doubt what people used to
say in opposition to Monimus the Cynic is obvious; but the usefulness
of what he said is obvious too, as long as we receive what is
profitable in what he said, while remaining within the limits of what
is true.
According to the comic playwright Menander, 16 Monimus the Cynic
used to declare that all human opinion (to hypolephthen) is only vanity
(tuphos). Marcus believed he was penetrating to the deepest truth of the
formula cited by Menander: in the final analysis, everything is a matter of
opinion; what troubles us are our value-judgments, and they are only
vanity (tuphos).
As Monimus said, it is usually precisely our vanity-tuphos in the sense
of " emptiness," "smoke," but also "pride "-which perverts our valuejudgments
(VI, l J):
Pride is a dreadful sophist, and it is just at the moment when you
think you are devoting yourself to serious matters that it enchants
you the most. Look, for instance, at what Crates says about a man
like Xenocrates.
The Philosopher-Slave and the Emperor-Philosopher 57
In antiquity, Platonists like Xenocrates had the reputation of being vain,
proud, and haughty, so it is not surprising that Crates-who, like
Monimus, was a Cynic-should have reproached him for his tuphos, or
puffed-up vanity. 17
There is no doubt that, either directly or indirectly, Marcus was familiar
with other Cynic texts. There is nothing surprising about this: on the
one hand, Cynicism and Stoicism were very close to each other with
regard to their conceptions of life; and on the other, as we have seen in
the case of Democritus and Monimus, our philosopher-emperor had the
gift of recognizing Stoic doctrines in the texts which retained his attention.

We also find several Platonic texts in the Meditations, taken from the
Apology (28b; 28d), the Gorgias (51 2d-e) , the Republic (486a) , and the
Theaetetus (1 74d-e) . Once again, this is not surprising, because the Plato
whom Marcus quotes is, so to speak, a "pre-Stoic" Plato-that is, one
who has Socrates speak in terms the Stoics would not have denied. For
this Plato/Socrates, the important questions are not those dealing with
life and death, but those that deal with justice and injustice, or good and
evil (VII, 44) ; we must remain at the post which has been assigned to us
(VII, 45); what matters is not to save one's life, but to spend it in the
worthiest way possible (VII, 46) ; he who embraces in one glance the
totality of time and of substance is not afraid of death (VII, 3 5) . Finally,
Marcus finds in the Theaetetus (1 74d-e) a description of the difficult
situation of a king, bereft of the leisure he needs to think and to philosophize,
like a shepherd shut up with his flock "in a pasture in the midst of
the mountains" (X, 23). What Marcus recognized in all these quotations
was Stoicism, not Platonism. 18
Marcus also read a text by Theophrastus, the student of Aristotle,
which he alone mentions of all the authors of antiquity. The passage
probably interested the judge in Marcus, responsible for assessing guilt,
since it raises the question of degrees of responsibility. According to
Theophrastus, crimes committed with pleasure, and resulting from the
attraction of pleasure, are more serious than those one is forced to commit
because of the suffering caused by an injustice we have borne, which
pushes us on to anger. Marcus approves of this theory (II, rn), and it has
been maintained that he was thereby unfaithful to Stoicism, since the
Stoa held that all faults are equal.19 Now, it is true that the Stoics considered
wisdom to be an absolute perfection. The slightest fault, therefore,
estranged a person from this perfection just as much as the most serious
one did. One was either a sage or not, and there was no intermediate
58 THE I N NER CITADEL
status. In theory, therefore, there was no such thing as a more or less
serious fault. Yet, for all that, the Stoics did allow for the possibility of
moral progress in the case of the non-sage, and consequently they also
admitted degrees of moral progress. Different degrees of the gravity of
faults could therefore also be allowed in the case of the non-sage.20
Epictetus himself, for that matter, also appears to consider that certain
faults are more easy to pardon than others (IV, l, 1 47) : the passion of
love, for example, is easier to pardon than that of ambition.
Marcus also mentions the " Pythagoreans," who ordained that we
should raise our eyes toward the heavens at dawn, in order to remind
ourselves of that model of order and purity represented by the stars
(XI, 27) .21
Epicurean maxims and passages from Epicurus are also to be found in
the Meditations. Marcus rewrites them into a Stoic vocabulary when he
quotes them, and he retains from them advice which a Stoic could
legitimately practice: be happy with the present, without regretting that
which we do not possess and could not possess (VII, 27) ; pain cannot be
simultaneously both unbearable and eternal (VII, 33; VII, 64) ; we should
always keep the virtues of the ancients in mind (XI, 26) ; and finally, in
every circumstance, we must remain on the level of philosophy, and not
let ourselves be dragged down into sharing the anthropomorphic viewpoints
of those who do not practice philosophy (IX, 41) .22 The commentary
Marcus gives on this last-mentioned passage-a letter written by
Epicurus while he was ill or on his deathbed-allows us to understand
how Stoics such as Seneca and Epictetus could find, even in Epicureanism,
maxims capable of nourishing their own meditation. We must not
assume that they were eclectics, rather than dyed-in-the-wool Stoics:
they knew perfectly well that there was a radical opposition between
Stoic and Epicurean doctrines, as well as between the practical attitude of
the Stoics and the Epicureans. They were also aware, however, that
Epicureanism, Stoicism, Platonism, and Aristotelianism were merely the
different and opposing forms of a single phenomenon: the philosophical
style of life. Within the latter, there could be points held in common by
several-or even all-of the schools, as Marcus states expressly with
regard to the letter of Epicurus (IX, 41):
It is common to all the schools not to depart from philosophy under
any circumstances, and not to let oneself be dragged into the chatter
of the vulgar, that is, of those who do not practice the science of
Nature.
The Philosopher-Slave and the Emperor-Philosopher 59
In particular, the Stoics and the Epicureans shared a specific attitude
with regard to time. They insisted on concentration on the present
moment,23 which allows us both to grasp the incomparable value of the
present instant, and to diminish the intensity of pain, as we become
conscious of the fact that we only feel and live this pain within the present
moment.
When all is said and done, it was as a Stoic, and as a disciple of
Epictetus, that Marcus read the texts of the philosophers whom he
quotes. For it is above all the reading of Epictetus, and the knowledge of
his teachings, which explain the Meditations.
The teachings of Epictetus
In the course of the preceding pages, we have encountered the name of
Epictetus more than once. Nor is this surprising, given that he is mentioned
many times in the Meditations. For instance, Marcus expresses his
gratitude to his Stoic teacher Rusticus for having passed along to him
notes taken at Epictetus' classes. Marcus often quotes texts explicitly from
Epictetus, and places him on the same level as those whom the Stoics
considered the greatest of masters (VII, 19, 2) :
How many men-like Chrysippus, like Socrates, like Epictetushas
Eternity swallowed up!
Epictetus was, at the time, considered to be the great philosopher. His
image and teachings were mentioned throughout the literature of the
second century A.D., and he was to remain a model for philosophers
down to the end of antiquity. The Latin author Aulus Gellius, who had
studied at Athens, mentions a conversation he had witnessed there in
which the rhetorician Herodes Atticus quoted a passage from the Discourses
of Epictetus, as collected by Arrian. He also informs us that, in
another conversation, the philosopher Favorinus had reported several of
the Master's sayings. In the course of a sea voyage, Aulus Gellius himself
had met another philosopher, who pulled the Discourses out of his travelbag
and read him a passage from them. Elsewhere in Gellius' Attic Nights,
we find allusions to details about Epictetus' life: his initial condition as a
slave; his expulsion from Rome by the emperor Domitian; and his eventual
settling down in Nicopolis.24 The satirist Lucian, who also lived
under the reign of Marcus, tells how an admirer once bought "the clay
lamp of the Stoic Epictetus" for 3 ,000 drachmas. " No doubt he hoped,"
60 THE I N NER CITADEL
remarks Lucian,25 " that if he read at night by the light of this lamp, the
wisdom of Epictetus would come upon him all of a sudden during his
sleep, and he would be just like that admirable old man." Marcus' doctor,
Galen, alludes to a dialogue which Favorinus of Ades had directed
against Epictetus, and which Galen himself refuted.26 Even Christians
such as Origen, who wrote in the third century, speak of Epictetus in
terms of respect. 27
Epictetus was born in the first century A.D., in Phrygian Hierapolis
(Pammukale in modern Turkey) . Sometime during the second half of
the century, he was brought to Rome as the slave of Epaphroditus, one
of Nero's freedmen. Epictetus mentions his master Epaphroditus several
times in the Discourses; he allowed his slave to attend the classes of the
Stoic philosopher Musonius Rufus. Musonius had a tremendous
influence on Epictetus; the latter frequently reproduces his teacher's
sayings in the Discourses, and describes his teaching as follows (III, 23, 29) :
"When we sat before him, each of us felt as though someone had denounced
our faults to him. Such was the exactitude with which he hit
upon our current state, and placed everyone's faults before his eyes."
After having been set free by Epaphroditus, Epictetus opened his own
philosophy school in Rome, but was expelled from the city, together
with all other philosophers, by the emperor Domitian in 93--94· He then
set himself up at Nicopolis, in Epirus on the Greek coast, a town which
served as a jumping-off point for the sea voyage across the Adriatic to
Italy. There he opened a new philosophy school. The Neoplatonist
Simplicius relates that Epictetus was so poor that the house he lived in at
Rome had no need for a lock, since it contained nothing other than the
mattress and the mat on which he used to sleep. The same author reports
that Epictetus had adopted an orphan, and had taken in a woman in
order to bring him up,28 but he never married.29 The precise date of his
death is not known.
Epictetus wrote nothing. If we can still get some idea of his teachings,
it is thanks to Arrian of Nicomedia, a politician who, as a young man
about rn8 A.D., had attended Epictetus' classes in Nicopolis, and later
published the " notes" he had taken at these classes. Arrian of Nicomedia
is an attractive character. 30 It should be pointed out right away that his
contemporaries considered him a philosopher: inscriptions dedicated to
him during his lifetime at Athens and Corinth designate him by this
title.31 The historian Cassius Dio had apparently written a "Life of Arrian
the Philosopher. "32 Arrian did, indeed, leave philosophical works behind
him. In addition to his notes which report the Sayings or Discourses of
Epictetus, one must add a little work which was of much greater impor-
The Philosopher-Slave and the Emperor-Philosopher 61
tance in the history of western thought: the so-called Manual of Epictetus
(in Greek, Encheiridion) . The word Encheiridion ("that which one has at
hand") alludes to a requirement of the Stoic philosophical life-a requirement
to which Marcus, too, had tried to respond by composing his
Meditations. In every one of life's circumstances, it was necessary to have
"at hand" the principles, " dogmas," rules of life, or formulas which
would allow a person to place himself in that inner disposition most
conducive to correct action, or to accept his fate. The Manual is a
selection of passages taken from the Sayings of Epictetus.33 It is a kind of
anthology of striking maxims aimed at illuminating the philosopher in
the course of his actions. Arrian also seems to have written a book on
celestial phenomena, or what was called meteorology in antiquity. 34 As we
have seen, however, a philosopher in antiquity was not someone who
wrote philosophical books, but someone who led a philosophical life,
and we have every reason to believe that Arrian, although he remained a
politician like Marcus' teacher Rusticus, tried to live like a philosopher.
We can surmise this from the end of his preface to Epictetus' Discourses;
by publishing them, Arrian wanted to produce in his readers the same
effect that Epictetus had on his auditors: to raise them up toward the
Good. His model, moreover, was Socrates' famous disciple Xenophon,
who had also had a military and political career at the same time as a
literary one. Arrian wanted to be known as the " new Xenophon"; he
imitates the latter both in style and in the subject matter of his works,
and, like Xenophon, he too wrote a treatise on hunting. Above all,
however, Arrian wrote the Discourses, which are as it were the Memorabilia
of Epictetus, the new Socrates.35 He certainly did not have in mind a
mere literary model, but a model for life: that of the philosopher in
action. Two centuries later, the philosopher Themistius36 would praise
Junius Rusticus and Arrian for having abandoned their books and placed
themselves at the service of the common good, not only like Cato and
other Romans, but especially like Xenophon and Socrates himself. For
Rusticus and Arrian, Themistius goes on, philosophy did not stop with
pen and ink: they were not content merely to write about courage, and
they did not shrink from their duty of serving the interests of the State.
Arrian did, indeed, enjoy a brilliant career as a statesman: he was
proconsul of the province of Beltica around 123 A.D., consul suffectus37 in
l 29 or l 3 o, and governor of Cappadocia from l 3 o (or l 3 l) to l 3 7 (or
l 3 8) . In this last capacity, he repulsed an invasion of the Alani in l 3 5,
made an inspection of the coasts of the Black Sea, and presented a report
on his trip to the emperor Hadrian.
In the preface he addressed to his friend Lucius Gellius, Arrian explains
THE I N NER CITADEL
the way he had gathered together his notes taken at the classes given by
Epictetus: "I did not compose them in a literary style, as could have been
done in the case of sayings of this kind, and I did not publish them
myself, precisely because I did not compose them." In antiquity, it was in
principle only works carefully composed according to the rules of style
and composition that were made public, either by means of a public
reading, or by giving the text over to booksellers.
Yet I tried to write down everything I heard while he was speaking,
in the same words that he used, in order to preserve for myself, in
the future, "notes to help me remember" (hypomnemata) his thought
and his freedom of speech. It is therefore natural that these notes
should have the appearance of a spontaneous, man-to-man conversation,
and not at all that of a composition intended to be read later.
What Arrian means is that he has reproduced, insofar as was possible, the
spontaneity of an exhortation or a dialogue, and this is how he explains
his use of popular language (koine) throughout the work, instead of the
literary style he had used in his other books. He continues: "I do not
know how notes which were in such a state have managed to find their
way into the public domain, unbeknownst to me and against my
wishes." The same thing probably happened to Arrian as had happened
to Galen: class notes, initially confided to friends, were gradually copied
in a wide variety of circumstances and were thus, for all intents and
purposes, "published." "I don't particularly care if people think me incapable
of properly composing a work." Here, by despising literary glory,
Arrian shows himself to be a good student of Epictetus.
As for Epictetus: it is not important in his case either, if it is true that
he held discourses in contempt. When he spoke, the only thing he
wanted was to set the thoughts of his listeners in motion toward
better things. If that is indeed the result of these discourses, then
they will certainly not fail to produce the effect that the discourse of
philosophers should produce. If the contrary should occur, then at
least may those who read them know that when they were spoken
by Epictetus himself, the person listening to them necessarily felt
what that man wanted him to feel. If these discourses fail to produce
this effect, perhaps I am to blame; perhaps, however, things just had
to be that way.
The Philosopher-Slave and the Emperor-Philosopher
I shall not go into detail about the discussions to which this passage has
given rise among historians. Some are of the opinion that Arrian has
preserved for us in his work the very words of Epictetus, taken down by
stenography. For others, on the contrary, Arrian, in his desire to imitate
Xenophon's Memorabilia, carried out a much more extensive editorial
activity than he gives us to understand in his letter to Gellius: he often
reconstituted Epictetus' sayings, since their literary form is much more
refined than Arrian was willing to admit. In any case, unless we suppose
that Arrian was capable of developing an original philosophical discourse
himself and attributing it to Epictetus, we have no alternative but to
concede that, as far as the main points are concerned, Arrian's work is
closely connected with the living teaching of Epictetus.38
We must not conclude from this, however-as has been done by the
majority of historians and commentators-that all of Epictetus' teachings
are contained in the Discourses as reported by Arrian. As we read them,
we find allusions to parts of the course which were not included by
Arrian. In fact, as has been shown by Souilhe,39 the greatest part of
Epictetus' course, as was the case for all philosophy courses from at least
the first century A.D. on, was devoted to the explanation of texts by the
founders of the school-that is, in the case of the Stoics, Zeno and
Chrysippus. The master would explain these texts, but this was also
sometimes the task of the auditors. Now, although Arrian did not reproduce
one single bit of this technical aspect of Epictetus' pedagogical
activity, he does sometimes allude to it. For instance, he relates a scene in
which one of Epictetus' students is explaining, under the guidance of a
more advanced student, a Stoic text concerning the logical problem of
syllogisms (I, 26, 13); similarly, he speaks of Epictetus getting up in the
morning and thinking about how he will direct the exercise of textual
explanation in his class later that day (I, IO, 8) .
This part of the class, then, which consisted of "reading"40 would
become the lectio of the Middle Ages, and finally our "lesson." It made
up the most essential part of Epictetus' teachings, but is completely
absent from the Discourses of Epictetus. What they do preserve for us,
however, is what could be termed the nontechnical part of the course.
All philosophy courses-at least since the beginning of the first century
A.D.-contained as an essential element the explanation of texts; yet they
could also end in a moment of free discussion between the philosopher
and his auditors. Aulus Gellius, writing a few decades after Arrian, tells
how his Platonic teacher had the habit, after the lectio or textual explanation,
of suggesting that his auditors question him on a topic of their
THE INNER CITADEL
choice. The Discourses narrated by Arrian thus correspond to those more
relaxed moments in which the Master entered into a dialogue with his
students, or developed remarks which he considered useful for the practice
of the philosophical life. 41
It is most important to emphasize this point, for it means that we
cannot expect to find technical and systematic expositions of the whole
of Stoic doctrine in Epictetus' Discourses as reported by Arrian. This does
not mean, however, that Epictetus did not, in that part of course devoted
to theoretical instruction, tackle the Stoic system as a whole by means of
the explanation of texts. In other words, we should not say that, of the
three parts of Stoic philosophy-physics, ethics, and logic-Epictetus
ignores physics, or that part of this discipline which described physical
phenomena; for we have no idea which Stoic texts Epictetus read during
his classes, nor of the explanation he gave of them. All we can say is that
he does not mention physical problems in those discourses with his
disciples which have come down to us. It does appear that Arrian himself
wrote a book on comets, which is unfortunately now lost to us. If this is
true, we can presume that Arrian had been initiated by Epictetus into the
philosophical treatment of this kind of question. The way Photius describes
the contents of the work even allows us to see what Arrian had
retained from the lessons of Epictetus-that is, the moral significance that
was to be attributed to physical investigations:42 "Arrian, who wrote a
little work on the nature, formation, and apparitions of comets, tries to
show in a number of discussions that appearances such as this do not
foretell anything, either good or evil."
We shall have occasion to return to Epictetus' conception of the
tripartite division of philosophy. For the moment, it is sufficient to say
that it would be utterly false to conclude, on the basis of the content of
the Discourses as they have come down to us, that Late Stoicism underwent
an impoverishment in its theoretical teaching.43 In the first place, as
we have seen, the Discourses only reproduce-certainly in a highly fragmentary
way-that part of the course which was, by definition, neither
theoretical nor technical. Second, they are only the echo of the remarks
that Arrian heard over a period of one or two years, during the time of
his stay at Nicopolis. Epictetus, by contrast, taught for twenty-five or
thirty years. Finally, we must not forget that only the first four books of
the Discourses have been preserved. This means that one or more books
have been lost: Aul us Gellius quotes a long passage from book V. 44
Thanks to Marcus Aurelius, we can also get a glimpse of the existence of
Epictetan texts otherwise unknown to us. Thus we can see that the
The Philosopher-Slave and the Emperor-Philosopher
Discourses, at least in the condition in which they have come down to us,
do not by any means give us an idea of everything that Epictetus said,
much less of what he did not say.
We know from Book I of the Meditations (chapter 7) that Marcus came
to know Epictetus thanks to Junius Rusticus, who had instructed Marcus
in Stoic doctrine before going on to become one of his counselors.
Marcus tells us that Rusticus lent him his personal copy of the hypomnemata
of Epictetus, that is, of notes taken at his classes. This assertion can
be interpreted in two ways: in the first place, we might think that the
writings in question were a copy of the work by Arrian. Arrian himself,
in his letter to Lucius Gellius mentioned above, represented his work as
hypomnemata, or notes designed to serve as an aide-memoire. The letter to
Gellius was probably written after the death of Epictetus, which took
place sometime between 125 and 130 A.D. The book was probably in
circulation by 1 30. Aulus Gellius tells us that during the year he spent
studying at Athens around 1 40, he was present at a discussion in the
course of which the famous millionaire Herodes Atticus had brought
from the library a copy of what Gellius calls the dissertationes of Epictetus,
put into order (digestae) by Arrian.45 He also tells how, on a sea voyage
from Cassiopoiea to Brindisium, he had encountered a philosopher who
was carrying this work in his traveler's sack; what is more, the philosopher
had read him a passage from the now-lost book V. Thus, thanks to
Rusticus, Marcus was able to read a copy of the Discourses as composed
by Arrian, and this copy was more complete than the ones known by our
modern editions.
Another hypothesis, proposed by Farquharson, 46 could also be envisaged.
The notes passed on by Rusticus to Marcus might have been
Rusticus' own, which he himself had taken at the classes of Epictetus.
From the point of view of chronology, if we assume that Epictetus died
between 125 and 130 A.D., and that Rusticus was born at the beginning
of the second century (as can be surmised from his official cursus) , it is
entirely possible that he may have been Epictetus' student around
1 20 A.D. Moreover, since the Discourses of Epictetus as reported by Arrian
were widely known in Greece around 140, it is difficult to imagine that
in the Rome of about 1 45-146 A.D.-at the time when Marcus had
become converted to philosophy-no copy of the work was to be
found. Marcus represents Rusticus' gift as something exceptional, so we
are entitled to wonder if the gift was indeed Rusticus' own notes. If this
were the case, then these notes may have revealed to Marcus an Epictetus
quite different from the one we know thanks to Arrian. After all,
66 THE I N NER CITA D EL
Epictetus certainly did not say the same things, every year, to all of his
students.
It is, in any case, virtually certain that Marcus did read Arrian's work,
since the Meditations contain several literal quotations taken from it.
Whether Marcus read only the Discourses as composed by Arrian, or
whether he also had access to the notes of Rusticus, one thing is certain:
Marcus was familiar with more texts pertaining to the teachings of
Epictetus than we are today. We now possess only a part of Arrian's
work; and the notes of Rusticus-if indeed they did exist-might well
have revealed to Marcus teachings of Epictetus other than those reported
by Arrian. As we shall see, it is thanks to Marcus that we have access to
several fragments of Epictetus which are otherwise unknown.
Quotations of Epictetus in the Meditations
You are a little soul carrying around a corpse, as Epictetus has said
(IV, 41).
When you kiss your child, says Epictetus, you must say to yourself:
"perhaps you will be dead tomorrow ... " (XI, 34).
These are the two explicit quotations of Epictetus which are to be
found in the Meditations.47 The first text is not to be found in the four
books of Epictetus' Discourses reported by Arrian which we possess today,
and came to Marcus, as I have said, by some other channel. The "soul
carrying around a corpse " also reappears in IX, 24, in one of a series of
descriptions of the miserable condition into which human life is plunged
when it is not in conformity with Nature and with Reason:
Infantile rages, infantile games! Souls carrying corpses around! In
order that the scene of the Evocation of the dead be before your
eyes in a yet more striking way.
In the other quotation from Epictetus (XI, 34), we can recognize a text
from book III of the Discourses (III, 24, 88).
Yet it often happens that Marcus repeats whole passages from
Epictetus, without quoting him. When Marcus (VII, 63) quotes a passage
from Plato (Republic, 4r 2e-4rJa), for example, he gives the text in the
form which had been given it by Epictetus (I, 28, 4) :
The Philosopher-Slave and the Emperor-Philosopher
Each soul is deprived of the truth against its will.
We encounter this quote again, moreover, in the long series of kephalaia
against anger (XI, 18, 5) .
Epictetus alluded to the Stoic theory of suicide as follows (I, 2 5, I 8) :
So there's some smoke in the house? If there's not too much, I'll
stay; if there's too much, I'll leave. For what you must never forget,
and keep firmly in mind, is that the door is wide open.
Marcus echoes Epictetus as follows 0f, 29, 2) :
Smoke? Then I'm leaving!
Epictetus gave the following recommendation to his disciple (III, 3, 1 4):
As soon as you go out in the morning, and whatever it is you see or
hear, carry out this test. You respond, as if we were having an
argument by questions and answers:
-What did you see?
-A handsome man, or a good-looking woman.
Then apply the rule (epage ton kanona), [and ask yourself] :
-Does their beauty depend upon their will, or not?
-It does not depend upon their will.
-Then reject it.
Once more, Marcus picks up the tune (V, 22) :
That which does not harm the State does not harm its citizen either.
Each time you imagine you have been injured, apply this rule (epage
touton ton kanona).
In both cases, we see a theoretical position or dogma (the distinction
between what does and does not depend on us, or the identity of interest
between the State and the citizen) represented as a rule (kanon) which
must be applied to each particular case.
The whole final part of Book XI (chapters 3 3-3 9) appears to be a
series of passages from Epictetus. First, as we have seen, Epictetus is cited
explicitly in chapter 34. Chapter 33 also gives an anonymous summary of
a passage from book III of the Discourses (III, 24, 86), while chapters
68 THE I N NER CITA D EL
3 5-3 6 cite still more texts from book III (III, 24, 92-93; III, 22, 105) . In
fact, it is as though we had before us a collection of notes that Marcus had
taken while reading book III of the Discourses.
The following chapter (XI, 3 7) is introduced by the phrase "he says,"
which gives us every right to suppose that Marcus is continuing to quote
the same author as in the preceding chapters-that is, Epictetus. This text
has no parallel in the Discourses, but it comes without any doubt from the
lost portion of Epictetus. In it, we can recognize Epictetus' usual vocabulary
(topos peri tas hormas, hypexairesis, kat' axian, orexis, ekklisis), and above
all one of his fundamental teachings: that of the three rules of life, or the
disciplines of judgment, of desire, and of action, of which I shall be
speaking throughout the present work.
Chapter 3 8 is also introduced by "he says," which can only designate
Epictetus. It is perhaps a rather free paraphrase of a text (III, 25, 3) in
which Epictetus affirms that the fight for virtue is no small matter, since
what is at stake is nothing less than happiness. Marcus remarks (XI, 3 8) :
The struggle, then, is not about winning just any old prize, but
about deciding whether one will be sane or insane.
The last chapter (XI, 3 9) is supposed to transmit various sayings of
Socrates, but since chapters 3 3 to 3 8 are taken from Epictetus, it is quite
likely that this passage should also be attributed to Epictetus.
There may be still other anonymous quotations from Epictetus in the
Meditations. H. Frankel48 thought, with good reason, that IV, 49, 2-5 was
one such quotation:
-I'm so unlucky that such-and-such a thing has happened to me!
-Not at all! On the contrary, you should say: "How lucky I am,
since now that such-and-such a thing has happened to me, I remain
free from grief I neither let myselfbe broken by the present, nor do
I fear what is going to happen! For this event could have happened
to anyone, but not everyone would have remained free from grief
-Why, moreover, should we say that this particular event is a
misfortune, while that one is a piece of good fortune? In general, do
you call anything a "misfortune " for man which does not cause the
nature of man to deviate from its goal? And do you think that that
which is not contrary to the will of Nature causes the nature of man
to deviate from its goal?
-What, then, is the will of Nature?
The Philosopher-Slave and the Emperor-Philosopher
-You've learned it. Does the event which has happened to you
prevent you from being just, from possessing greatness of soul, from
being temperant and prudent, without haste in your judgments,
without falsity in your speech, reserved, and free, and everything
else such that, when they are present together, the nature of man
possesses that which is proper to it?
Frankel bases his contention on lexical and grammatical particularities
which are quite convincing. 49 It could perhaps be objected-quite
rightly-that this passage basically does nothing but express in dialogue
form the fundamental dogma of Stoicism: that the only evil is moral evil,
in other words, that which prevents us from practicing the virtues. This
is true, but it does not alter the fact that the tone and form of this passage
are in stark contrast with the rest of the Meditations. Normally, when
Marcus uses the word "I," he is speaking either about himself, or about
the good man, speaking to himself Here, by contrast, the "I" represents
the interlocutor of a dialogue which Marcus is reporting. It is highly
probable that this is a dialogue which Epictetus has imagined before his
auditors, as he often does in the Discourses, and that Marcus has copied it
down. It should be noted that, elsewhere in his Discourses (I, 4, 23) ,
Epictetus tells his auditors that what is truly worthwhile is to work at
eliminating all "Alas!" and "How unhappy I am!" from one's life.
It is thus probable that we have here an unrecognized fragment of
Epictetus. Are there others? I think it likely that there are some. In
general, moreover, we should not exclude the hypothesis that a given
passage of the Meditations may be utilizing a text from an unknown
author, or at any rate may be a paraphrase thereof As far as Epictetus is
concerned, however, we must bear in mind the fact that Marcus had read
so much of him as to become impregnated with his vocabulary, his
stylistic habits, and especially his ideas. This situation was recognized
perfectly by the unknown fourteenth-century humanist who copied extracts
from Books I to IX in a manuscript now kept at Darmstadt. At the
beginning of Book II, he wrote: antikrus epiktetizei ("He is openly
Epictetizing"; that is, he is following and imitating Epictetus) .
The three rules oflife or disciplines according to Epictetus
We have already seen the important role played in the Meditations by
what I have called the triple rule of life, which proposes a discipline of
representations or judgments, of desire, and of action. This very triparti-
THE INNER CITADEL
tion of the acts and functions of the soul, and the entire distinction
between judgment, desire, and impulse, is a doctrine which is peculiar to
Epictetus, and which is not found in Stoicism prior to him. Its presence
in Marcus Aurelius is, nevertheless, unmistakable. In VIII, 7, for example,
Marcus clearly draws an opposition between representations (phantasiai),
desires (orexeis), and impulses toward action (hormai), and he does so
again in VIII, 28:
Every judgment, every impulse to action, and every desire or aversion
are within the soul, and nothing else can enter therein.
We have already encountered a brief maxim which also makes use of the
same schema:
Erase your representation (phantasia), check your impulse to action
(horme), extinguish your desire (orexis). Keep your directing principle
(hegemonikon) within your power (IX, 7) .
The three rules of life propose an askesis, or discipline, for these three
acts of the soul. In the context of the cento of passages from Epictetus
(XI, 3 3-3 9) which we have already seen, Marcus himself cites an
Epictetan passage which we know only through his intermediary
(XI, 3 7):
We must discover the rule to be applied in the case of the assent [to
be given to representations and judgments] ,
-while in the matter of exercises relating to impulses to action,
we must never relax our attention, in order that these impulses to
action may be accompanied by a reserve clause, that their goal be to
serve the community, and that they be proportionate to value,
-and, finally, we must abstain completely from desire, and pay
no attention to things that do not depend on us.
Discipline of representations and judgment, discipline of impulsive
action, discipline of desire: Epictetus formulates these three rules of life
not only in this text, but in several chapters of his Discourses. Moreover,
they correspond precisely to the three rules oflif e formulated by Marcus,
which are in a sense the key to his Meditations.
The Philosopher-Slave and the Emperor-Philosopher 71
The influence of Aristo
In the context of Marcus' conversion to philosophy, I alluded to the
influence that the reading of the works of the third century B.C. Stoic
Aristo of Chios may have exerted on the Emperor. I had once thought I
could recognize an echo of Aristo's teachings in some of the Emperor's
sayings. Aristo had defined the supreme goal of life in the following
terms: "To live in a disposition of indifference with regard to indifferent
things." Marcus, for his part, writes (XI, 1 6):
To spend one's life in the best way: the power to do this resides
within the soul, if one is indifferent to indifferent things.
I was once struck by the similarity of these formulas. 50 In fact, however,
Aristo was not the only Stoic to speak of indifference to indifferent
things; moreover, Marcus, as a faithful adherent to the Stoicism of
Epictetus and of Chrysippus, did not understand this principle in the
same sense as Aristo, and interpreted it in a wholly different way.
The principle of all Stoicism is, moreover, precisely indifference to
indifferent things. This means, in the first place, that the only value is
moral good, which depends on our freedom, and that everything that
does not depend on our freedom-poverty, wealth, sickness, and
health-is neither good nor bad, and is therefore indifferent. Second, it
means that we must not make any distinction between indifferent things;
in other words, we must love them equally, since they have been willed
by universal Nature. This indifference to indifferent things can be found,
for example, in a passage from Philo of Alexandria,51 which describes the
exercise of wisdom-that is to say, philosophy-without there having
been any particular influence by Aristo on Philo: "Accustomed no
longer to pay attention to bodily and external evils, exercising ourselves
to be indifferent to indifferent things, armed against pleasures and desires
... for such people, all oflife is a festival."
As a matter of fact, the difference between Aristo and the other Stoics
bore precisely on the very notion of "indifferent." For Aristo, that which
was indifferent was completely "undifferentiated, "52 and no element of
daily life had any importance in and of itself Such a view ran the risk of
leading to a skeptical attitude such as that of Pyrrho, who was also
indifferent to everything. Orthodox Stoics, while they recognized that
the things which do not depend on us are indifferent, nevertheless admitted
that we could attribute to them a moral value, by conceding the
72 THE I N NER CITADEL
existence of political, social, and family obligations, linked to the needs of
human nature in accordance with reasonable probability. This was the
realm of the kathekonta, or duties, of which I shall have more to say later.
Marcus Aurelius, like Epictetus, allowed for the existence of this entire
order of obligations and duties, which Arista had denied. In fact, Marcus
uses the technical term kathekon in the Stoic sense a total of five times. 53
There can thus be no question of any influence by Arista on Marcus as
far as the doctrine of indifference is concerned.
Moreover, Arista rejected the physical and logical parts of philosophy
as useless.54 At first glance, Marcus appears to incline toward a similar
attitude; for example, he thanks the gods for not having allowed him to
be carried away with resolving syllogisms or studying celestial phenomena
(I, 1 7, 22) . Elsewhere, he admits that he no longer hopes to excel in
dialectics or in the philosophy of nature (VII, 67) . Here again, however,
the underlying sense is wholly different. For Arista, logic and physics are
strictly useless. For Marcus, by contrast, it is the theoretical discourse oflogic
and physics which is no longer a matter of concern. He did, however,
intend to practice a lived logic (the discipline of judgment) and a lived
physics (the discipline of desire) . As he says explicitly (VIII, lJ):
Continuously, and, if possible, on the occasion of every representation
which presents itself to you, practice physics, pathology,
and dialectics.
We are thus forced to conclude that there is no trace of Aristo's
doctrines to be found in the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius. 55

THE STOIC ISM OF EPICT ETUS
The general characteristics of Stoicism
It is probably scarcely necessary to remind the reader that when we speak
of the doctrines of a philosopher from the period we are studying, we
must not imagine that we have to do with a system invented lock, stock,
and barrel by the philosopher in question. Ancient philosophy had nothing
in common with our contemporary philosophers, who imagine that
philosophy consists, for each philosopher, in inventing a "new discourse"
or new language, all the more original the more it is incomprehensible
and artificial. In general, ancient philosophy was situated within a tradition,
and attached to a school. Now, Epictetus was a Stoic; this means
that for him philosophy consisted in explicating the texts of Zeno and
Chrysippus, the founders of the school, and above all in practicing himself,
and having his disciples practice, the way oflife peculiar to the Stoic
school. This does not mean that Epictetus' teaching was devoid of its
own characteristic features. These features, however, did not modify the
fundamental dogmas of Stoicism, or the essential choice of a way of life.
On the contrary, they are to be found within his form of teaching, in his
way of presenting the doctrine, and in the definition of certain specific
points (for instance, the distinction between desire and impulse) , or else
within the particular color and tonality which permeate the Stoic way of
life proposed by the philosopher.
By the time Epictetus taught, it had been some four centuries since
Zeno of Citium had founded the Stoic school at Athens. One can say
that Stoicism was born of the fusion of three traditions: the Socratic
ethical tradition, the Heraclitean physical and "materialistic " tradition,
and the dialectical tradition of the Megareans and of Aristotle. The Stoic
choice of life was analogous to the Socratic choice of life, according to
which moral good or virtue is the only value, to which everything else
74 THE I N NER CITADEL
must be subordinated. As Socrates says in Plato's Apology (41 d): "For a
good man, no evil is possible, whether he be dead or alive." "No evil is
possible," precisely because such a man, since he is good, is a stranger to
moral evil. Since for him there is no other evil than moral evil, he
believes that all those things which appear to be evil in the eyes of
men-death, illness, the loss of wealth, insults-are not evils for him.
This transmutation of values, however, can only be carried out by means
of an operation which is, at the same time, both intellectual and ethical: it
consists in examining oneselfin a dialogue, a logos, or a process ofreasoning
which one develops either with someone else or with oneself. The
spirit of Socratism is thus the affirmation of the absolute value of moral
good, as discovered by reason; it is also the idea according to which the
moral life is a matter of judgment and of knowledge.
Prima facie, it does not appear that the physical tradition of Heraclitean
" materialism" has anything to do with the Socratic ethical tradition.
We shall soon see, however, that the originality of Stoicism consists
precisely in the intimate and indissoluble fusion of these two traditions.
For the moment, it is sufficient to emphasize the influence of Heraclitus
upon the Stoic vision of a universe in perpetual transformation, of which
the original element is fire, and which is set in order by a logos or Reason,
in accordance with which events are linked by mutual necessity.
Finally, it is not surprising that Stoicism is situated as well within the
dialectical tradition of the Megarians, but also within that of the Platonic
Academy and of Aristotle. In this period, instruction in philosophy consisted
above all in training for discussion and argumentation, and consequently
in dialectical exercises. Here again, we encounter a logos: this
time it is human discourse, but one which is rational and just, insofar as it
imitates that logos which maintains the universe in order.
We can thus glimpse the extraordinary unity which held the parts of
the Stoic system together. It is the unity of one single logos, or Reason,
which permeates all things. In the words of Emile Brehier:
It is one single, unique reason which, in dialectics, links consequent
propositions to their antecedents; which, in nature, links together
all causes; and which, in human conduct, establishes perfect concord
between acts. It is impossible that a good man should not be a
physicist and a dialectician; it is impossible for rationality to be
realized separately in these three areas; it is impossible completely to
grasp the reason within the course of events in the universe without,
at the same time, realizing reason within one's own behavior. 1
The Stoicism of Epictetus 75
Stoicism is a philosophy of self-coherence, based upon a remarkable
intuition of the essence of life. From the very first moment of its existence,
every living being is instinctively attuned to itself; that is, it tends to
preserve itself, to love its own existence, and to love all that can preserve
this existence. This instinctive accord becomes a moral accord with
oneself, as soon as man discovers by means of his reason that the supreme
value is not those things which are the objects of this instinct for selfpreservation,
but the reflective choice of accord with oneself, and the
activity of choice itself. This is because voluntary accord with oneself coincides
with the tendencies of universal Reason, which not only makes
each living being into a being in accord with itself, but makes the entire
world as well a being in accord with itself In the words of Marcus
Aurelius (IV, 23) :
All that is in accord with you is in accord with me, 0 World.
Human society, which is the society of those who participate in one
single logos or Reason, also forms-at least in principle-an ideal City,
whose Reason, which is the Law, ensures its accord with itself Finally, it
is obvious that the Reason of each individual, in the mutual linkage of its
thoughts or speech, demands logical and dialectical coherence with itself
This coherence with oneself is thus the fundamental principle of Stoicism.
For Seneca,2 all wisdom may be summed up in the formula: "Always
want the same thing, and always refuse the same thing." There is no
need, Seneca continues, to add the tiny restriction " as long as what one
wants is morally good." Why? Because, he says, " One and the same
thing can be universally and constantly pleasing only if it is morally
right." This is nothing but the distant echo of the formulas by which
Zeno, the founder of Stoicism, used to define the sovereign Good: "Live
in a coherent way (homologoumenos);3 that is to say, live in accordance
with a rule of life which is one and harmonious, because those who live
in incoherence are unhappy."
This coherence with oneself is, as we have seen, based on the selfcoherence
of universal Reason or Nature. The well-known Stoic theme
of the Eternal Return is only one other aspect of this theme. Universal
Reason wishes this world to be as it is: that is to say, arising from the
original fire, and returning to this original fire, and therefore having a
beginning and an end. Nature's will, however, is always the same; and
the only thing its continuous action can accomplish is the repetition of
this world, with precisely this beginning, precisely this end, and the
THE I N NER CITA D EL
entire course of events situated between these two moments. Thus, this
world returns eternally: "There will be another Socrates, a Plato, and
every man with the same friends and the same fellow-citizens . . . and
this renewal will not happen once, but several times; rather, all things
will be repeated eternally. "4 This is why the sage, like universal Reason,
must intensely wish for each instant: he must wish intensely for things to
happen eternally exactly as they do happen.
I have just mentioned the figure of the sage. It was characteristic of
Stoic philosophy to make of this figure a transcendent norm, which can
only be realized in rare and exceptional cases. Here we encounter an
echo of Plato's Symposium (204d) , where Socrates appears as the figure
who knows that he is not a sage. Socrates' situation places him between
the gods, who are wise and know that they are wise, and men, who think
they are wise but do not realize that they are not. This intermediary
situation is that of the philosopher: he who loves and aspires to wisdom
precisely because he knows that he lacks it. It is also the situation of Eros,
who loves Beauty because he knows he lacks it; neither man nor god,
Eros is therefore a daimon, intermediary between the two. The figure of
Socrates thus coincides both with that of Eros and with that of the
philosopher. 5
Similarly, the Stoic sage is the equal of God, since God is nothing
other than universal Reason, producing in self-coherence all the events
of the universe. Human reason is an emanation or part of this Universal
Reason. It can, however, become obscured and deformed as a result of
life within the body, owing in particular to the attractions of pleasure. It
is only the sage who is able to make his reason coincide with universal
Reason. Such perfect coincidence, however, can only be an ideal, for the
sage is necessarily an exceptional being. There are very few of themperhaps
only one, or perhaps none at all. He is an almost inaccessible
ideal, and, in the last analysis, more of a transcendent norm than anything
else, which the Stoics never tire of describing, even as they enumerate all
its paradoxes. Philosophy is not wisdom, but only the exercise of wisdom,
and if the philosopher is not a sage, he is necessarily a non-sage.
There is thus a contradictory opposition between sage and non-sage:
either one is a "sage " or one is not, and there is no middle term. There
are no degrees of unwisdom, relative to wisdom. As the Stoics used to
say, it doesn't matter much if you are one cubit below the surface of the
water, or five hundred fathoms: you'll drown in the one case just as
much as in the other. Since, then, the sage is extremely rare, all humanity
is out of its mind, and men suffer from an almost universal corruption of
The Stoicism of Epictetus 77
or deviation from Reason. Yet the Stoics still urge people to philosophize-that
is, to train themselves for wisdom. They therefore believe in
the possibility of spiritual progress.
The explanation of this apparent paradox is that, although it is true that
there is a contradictory opposition between wisdom and unwisdom, and
therefore that there are no degrees of unwisdom as opposed to wisdom,
it is nevertheless the case that, as in Plato's Symposium, there are two
categories of people within the state of unwisdom itself those non-sages
who are not conscious of their state-these are the foolish ones-and
those non-sages who are aware of their state, and who attempt to progress
toward inaccessible wisdom. Those in the latter category are philosophers.

Thus, from the point of view of logic, we have here a contrary opposition
between the sage and the foolish, who are unaware of their state.
This opposition does, however, admit of a middle tem1: the non-foolish
non-sages-in other words, philosophers. 6
The ideal sage would thus be one who could, at each moment and
definitively, make his reason coincide with that universal Reason which
is the Sage that thinks and produces the world.
An unexpected consequence of this Stoic theory of the sage is that
Stoic philosophy-and I do mean Stoic philosophy; that is, the theory
and the practice of training for wisdom-allows for a great deal of uncertainty
and simple probability. After all, only the Sage possesses a perfect,
nece�sary, and unshakable knowledge of reality; the philosopher does
not. The goal, project, and object of Stoic philosophy are thus to allow
the philosopher to orient himself or herself within the uncertainties of
daily life, by proposing probable choices which our reason can accept,
even if it is not always sure it ought to. What matters are not results or
efficiency, but the intention to do good. What matters is to act out of one
motive alone, without any other considerations of interest or pleasure:
that of the moral good. This is the only value, and the only one we need.
The Stoics on the parts of philosophy
By the time Zeno founded the Stoic school, the custom of distinguishing
various parts of philosophy, and of determining their mutual relationship,
was already traditional within the teaching provided by the philosophical
schools. Since the time of Plato, and especially since that of Aristotle,
philosophers had been paying the most careful attention to questions
THE I N NER CITADEL
concerning the different types of knowledge, and the various methods
which characterize them. 7
We can presume that within the Platonic school, also known as the
Old Academy, there was already a distinction between three parts of
philosophy: dialectics, physics, and ethics. Dialectics was the noblest part
of philosophy, inasmuch as, in the sense that Plato had given to this term,
it corresponded to the discovery of the Ideas or Forms (for example, the
notion of Justice or of Equality) . This discovery was brought about by a
" dialectical" method of discussion; that is to say, for the Platonists, by
means of rigorous argumentation. Physics, as the study of the visible
world, was an inferior part of philosophy, but it did have as its object, to
some degree at least, celestial phenomena, or the necessary, eternal
movement of the stars. Ethics was lower still, inasmuch as its objects were
the uncertain, contingent actions of mankind. Thus, the division of the
parts of philosophy reflects the hierarchy which the Platonists had introduced
among the various degrees of reality.
The Stoics, at the same time as they took up this division, transformed
it completely. Their terminology appears to remain the same, but it no
longer corresponds to the hierarchy of the Platonists, but rather to the
dynamic, unitary conception of the world which was peculiar to the
Stoa. Among physics, ethics, and dialectics, there was no longer any
preeminence of one discipline over the others, for all three were related
to the same logos or divine Reason. This Reason was equally present in
the physical world, in the world of social life-since society is based
upon the reason common to all mankind-and in human speech and
thought; that is, within the rational activity of judgment.
Moreover, from the point of view of perfect action, which is that of
the sage, these three disciplines mutually imply one another, since it is
one and the same logos or Reason which is to be found within nature, the
human community, and individual reason. This is why, to return once
more to the remarks of Emile Brehier, "it is impossible for a good man
[that is, one who practices ethics] not to be a physician and a dialectician;
it is impossible for rationality to be realized separately in these three areas,
and, for instance, to grasp reason fully in the course of events in the
world, without at the same time realizing reason within one's own conduct.
"8 The perfect exercise of any one of these disciplines implies that of
all the others. The sage practices dialectics by maintaining coherence in
his judgments; he practices ethics by maintaining coherence in his will,
and in the actions which result from it; and he practices physics by
behaving like a part which is coherent with the whole to which it
The Stoicism of Epictetus 79
belongs. For the Stoics, the parts of philosophy are virtues9 which-like
all virtues, in their view-are equal and mutually imply one another: to
practice one of them is necessarily to practice all of them.
Thus, from this point of view, there is a sense in which logic, physics,
and ethics are not really distinct from one another; no one of them
precedes the others, and they are all mixed up together. The PlatonicAristotelian
model of a hierarchy of knowledge and of levels of reality is
thus replaced by the representation of an organic unity, in which there is
complete compenetration. For the Platonists and the Aristotelians, the
whole of reality is heterogeneous, and is composed of zones in which
substantiality and necessity are completely different. For the Stoics, on
the contrary, all reality is homogeneous, and the sequence of events
wholly necessary. The distinction between physics, as the science of the
sensible world, and a science of the transcendent world of Ideas (that is,
Platonic dialectics) or of the gods (theology) is completely abolished.
Physis or nature, which, for the Platonists and the Aristotelians, was only
a small part-and the lowest part at that-of the whole of reality, becomes
all of reality.
The word "dialectics" also changes its meaning. It no longer denotes,
as it does for Plato, a method of reasoning which starts from notions
common to all mankind, and rises, by means of questions and answers, to
the discovery of those essences which make reasoning and language
possible. Nor does it denote, as it did for Aristotle, a method ofreasoning
which starts from notions which are common to all mankind-and
therefore not scientific-and makes possible, by means of questions and
answers, the attainment of probable conclusions in every area of reality.
Although Stoic dialectics also takes its point of departure in common
notions, it is able to obtain true and necessary conclusions because it
reflects the necessary interrelation of causes within the sensible world.
To be sure, for the Stoics, physics, ethics, and dialectics are--formally
at least-to be related to three different sectors of reality: the physical
world, human conduct, and the functioning of thought. Nevertheless,
the Stoics did not consider these three parts as corpora of theoretical
doctrines, but as inner dispositions and practical conduct of the sage, and
hence of the philosopher in training for wisdom. From this perspective,
the living exercise of physics, ethics, and dialectics, and the practice of
these three virtues, in fact corresponds to one attitude: the single act of
placing oneself in harmony with the logos, whether it be the logos of
universal Nature, the logos of rational human nature, or the logos as it is
expressed in human discourse.
So THE I N NER CITADEL
Although physics, ethics, and dialectics are practically merged together
into a single act when it comes to the concrete exercise of philosophy,
they must nevertheless be well distinguished when it comes to teaching
them. Philosophy must be set forth and described before the disciple.
Thus, philosophical discourse introduces a temporal dimension which
has two aspects: there is the "logical" time of the discourse itself, and
then there is the psychological time which the disciple requires to assimilate
what he or she is being taught. Logical time corresponds to the inner
requirements of theoretical discourse: there must be a series of arguments,
which must be presented in a specific order, and this is logical
time. All expositions of doctrine, however, are addressed to an auditor,
and the auditor introduces another component: the stages of his spiritual
progress; and here we are dealing with a time which is purely psychological.
Until the auditor has assimilated a given doctrine inwardly and
spiritually, it is either useless or impossible to speak to him or her about
anything else. There is, moreover, a kind of conflict between these two
times, for it is often difficult to safeguard the logical order while still
taking the auditor's spiritual state into account.
Thus, from the point of view of that discourse which transmits philosophical
instruction, the Stoics distinguished very sharply and clearly
between the three parts of philosophy, and tried to establish among them
not only a logical order, but also a pedagogical one. There was much
discussion on this topic within the school, for there was no agreement on
the order which was to be established between physics, ethics, and logic
or dialectics. We know that the Stoics used to compare the parts of
philosophy to the parts of organic totalities such as an egg, a garden, or a
living being. However, although logic was always presented in these
comparisons as the part which ensures self-defense and solidity, the innermost
and most precious part was sometimes presented as ethics, and
sometimes as physics.
In his treatise On Stoic Self-Contradictions, Plutarch10 reproaches
Chrysippus with having sometimes placed physics as the end-point of
philosophical instruction, as if it were the supreme initiation which transmitted
teachings about the gods, and at other times placing physics before
ethics, since the distinction between good and evil was only possible
on the basis of the study of universal Nature and the organization of the
world. In fact, these hesitations correspond to the various types of educational
program which could be chosen. According to the logical order of
exposition, physics should precede ethics, in order to give it a rational
foundation. According to the psychological order of education, however,
The Stoicism of Epictetus 81
physics must follow ethics, because it is by practicing ethics that one
prepares oneself for the revelation of the divine world, that is, of universal
Nature.
It was in order to get past these difficulties that some Stoics, while
continuing to profess their own theory concerning the ideal priority of a
given part of philosophy within the overall educational program, urged
that the parts of philosophy be presented simultaneously within the context
of instructional philosophical discourse: " Some Stoics held that no
part of philosophy had any priority, but that they were all mixed together;
and they made their teaching mixed, too. "11 The parts of philosophy
were "inseparable. "12 How, indeed, could one wait until one
finished the complete program for one part, before beginning the study
of another? Above all, how could one wait to practice philosophy itself,
in all its three aspects? Chrysippus himself seems to have recommended
this type of "mixed" instruction, for he writes: " He who begins with
logic must not abstain from the other parts, but must participate in the
other studies, when the opportunity arises. "13 In fact, the method of
teaching must be integral at each of its moments, since we are not trying
to acquire three distinct theoretical bodies of knowledge, separate from
one another, but rather to train ourselves for that unique act of wisdom
which is, indissolubly, the practice of physics, of ethics, and oflogic.
In view of the preceding considerations, we are now better able to
understand how the Stoics distinguished between philosophy and discourse
concerning philosophy. They affirmed that logic, physics, and ethics-which
up until now I have been calling, in accordance with common
usage, the parts of philosophy-were not in fact parts of philosophy
properly so called, but parts of discourse concerning philosophy. 14 The
only time physics, logic, and ethics appear as distinct, separate, and perhaps
even successive, is within the context of the philosophical teaching
discourse.
It is this teaching discourse which requires a theoretical exposition of
logic, in the form of an abstract study of the rules of reasoning. It also
requires a theoretical exposition of physics, that is to say, an abstract study
of the structure and coming-to-be of the cosmos. Finally, it requires a
theoretical exposition of ethics-in other words, an abstract study of
human behavior, and of the rules which it ought to obey. Chrysippus
used to say explicitly that these were the "three kinds of theoremata proper
to philosophy. "15 In philosophy itself, by contrast, understood as the
exercise of wisdom, physics, ethics, and logic are mutually implicated
within and interior to one another, in that act-at once multiple and
82 THE I N NER CITA D EL
unique--which is the exercise of physical virtue, ethical virtue, and
logical virtue. At this point, we are no longer concerned with producing
abstract theories of logic-that is, theories of the art of speaking and
writing well; rather, we are concerned with speaking and writing well in
reality. We no longer construct abstract theories of ethics, or of acting
well; instead we are concerned about whether we are in fact acting well.
Finally, at this level we are no longer interested in developing abstract
theories about physics, in order to prove that we are a part of the cosmic
All; rather, we try to live as a true part of the cosmic All.
These three exercises mutually imply one another, and in fact they
constitute one single act or disposition, which is differentiated only insofar
as it is oriented toward the three aspects of reality: the Reason of
human discourse, the Reason of human society, and the Reason of the
cosmos.
Thus, logic, physics, and ethics are distinguishable when we talk about
philosophy, but not when we live it.
The three acts of the soul and the three exercise-themes
according to Epictetus
From Zeno (332-262 B.c.) and Chrysippus (c. 281-204 B.c.) to Epictetus
(died c. 125 A.D.) , the formulation of Stoic doctrine evolved-particularly
as a result of its polemics with other philosophical schools-and
sometimes the rigor of the positions of the school's founders was somewhat
attenuated. Yet its fundamental dogmas never changed.
Epictetus himself, at any rate-perhaps because of his teaching methods,
which obliged him to explicate the works of the founding fatherswent
back to the origins. As Brehier used to say, Epictetus cannot be too
highly recommended to anyone wishing to understand the Old Stoa.16
Already in 1 894, in two remarkable studies devoted to Epictetus,
A. Bonhoffer had reached similar conclusions.17 It can be said that
Epictetus subscribes to the most orthodox Stoic tradition: that which,
beginning with Chrysippus, apparently continues through Archedemus
and Antipater; 18 he makes no allusions to Panetius or to Posidonius.
Through Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius was able to go back to the purest
Stoic sources, and the following exposition of the Stoicism of Epictetus
may consequently be regarded as a preliminary sketch of the Stoicism of
Marcus Aurelius.
It is true that, in the sayings of Epictetus as recorded by Arrian, we
The Stoicism of Epictetus
nowhere find a systematic exposition of the totality of Stoic doctrine; the
reasons for this have been explained above. The subj ects of the Discourses
were inspired by occasional circumstances, such as the questions raised by
his students, or the visit of a specific personage. Epictetus' sayings are
essentially anecdotal; but it is all the more precious to be able to observe
within them the presence of a highly structured theme, which frequently
recurs and can be said to summarize the essential points of Stoicism.
There is one highly structured theme that integrates right at the outset
something which, it would seem, Epictetus is the only one within the
Stoic tradition, besides Marcus Aurelius, to distinguish: the three activities
or operations of the soul. These are the desire to accumulate that
which is good, the impulse to act, and judgment on the value of things.
Basing his view on the traditional and fundamental Stoic distinction
between those things which do not depend upon our will and those
which do, Epictetus enumerates these three psychological operations as
follows:
What depends on us are value-judgments (hypolepseis), impulses
toward action (horme), and desire (orexis) or aversion; in a word,
everything which is our own business. What does not depend on us
are the body, wealth, honors, and high positions in office; in a
word, everything which is not our own business. 19
Here, we can glimpse one of the Stoics' most fundamental attitudes:
the delimitation of our own sphere of liberty as an impregnable islet of
autonomy, in the midst of the vast river of events and of Destiny. What
depends on us are thus the acts of our soul, because we can freely choose
them. We can judge or not judge, or judge in whatever manner we
please; we can desire or not desire; will or not will. By contrast, that
which does not depend on us-Epictetus lists our body, honors, riches,
and high positions of authority-is everything that depends upon the
general course of nature. Our body, first: it is true that we can move it,
but we are not completely in control of it. Birth, death, sickness, involuntary
movements, sensations of pleasure or of pain: all these are completely
independent of our will. As for wealth and honors: we can, to be
sure, attempt to acquire them, yet definitive success does not depend
upon us, but upon a series of human factors and events which are exterior
to us; they are imponderable and do not depend upon our will.
Thus, the Stoic delimits a center of autonomy-the soul, as opposed to
the body; and a guiding principle (hegemonikon) as opposed to the rest of
THE I N NER CITADEL
the soul. It is within this guiding principle that freedom and our true self
are located. It is also there, and only there, that moral good and evil can
be found, for the only moral good and evil are voluntary good and evil.
The soul or guiding principle thus has three fundamental activities. In
the first place, as it receives the images which come from bodily sensations,
it develops an inner discourse, and this is what constitutes judgment.
The soul tells itself what a given object or event is; in particular, it tells
itself what the object is for the soul, that is, what it is in the soul's view.
Here we have the central node of the whole of Stoicism: that of inner
discourse, or judgments expressed on the subject of representations. As
Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius never tire of saying, everything is a matter
of judgment. It is not things themselves that trouble us, but our representations
of these things, the ideas we form of them, and the inner
discourse which we formulate about them. Desire and impulses to action
are the necessary results of this inner discourse: if we desire something, it
is because we have told ourselves that the thing in question is good;
likewise, if we want to do something, it is because we have told ourselves
that it was a good thing.
As is well known, the Stoics held that only those representations
should be accepted into the mind which they called kataleptikai, a term
which is usually translated as "comprehensive." This translation gives the
impression that the Stoics believed a representation to be true when it
"comprehends," or seizes the contents of reality. In Epictetus, however,
we can glimpse a wholly different meaning of the term: for him, a
representation is kataleptike when it does not go beyond what is given,
but is able to stop at what is perceived, without adding anything extraneous
to that which is perceived. Rather than " comprehensive representations,"
then, it would be better to speak of " adequate representations."

Here is a translation-slightly paraphrased, in order to make it more
comprehensible-of a vital passage from the Discourses of Epictetus. It
shows in action the inner discourse, or the soul's dialogue with itself, on
the subj ect of representations (III, 8, 1-2) :
In the same way as we train ourselves in order to be able to face up
to sophistical interrogations, we ought also to train ourselves to face
up to representations (phantasiai), for they too ask us questions.
For example, let's say we formulate within ourselves the contents of the
representation: " So-and-so's son is dead."
The Stoicism of Epictetus
This representation is asking you a question, and you should reply:
"That does not depend on the will, and is not something bad."
" So-and-so's father has disinherited him. What do you think of
that?" Reply: "That doesn't depend on the will, and is not something
bad."
"He was very hurt by it." Reply: "That does depend on the will,
and is something bad."
"He put up with it bravely." "That depends on the will, and is
something good."
Epictetus continues:
If we acquire this habit, we will make progress; for we will give our
assent only to that of which there is an adequate (kataleptike) representation.

It is quite remarkable that Epictetus here is representing moral life as a
dialectical exercise, in which we engage in a dialogue with events, as
they ask us questions.
Epictetus then goes on to give the following examples, in which
representations ask us questions. "Her son is dead" is an inner representation
which we formulate, and it asks us the question: "What happened?"
This could lead us to enunciate a value-judgment, of the type "a
great misfortune," but we must reply: "Her son is dead." The representation,
however, is not satisfied; it asks "Nothing more?" to which the
soul responds: "nothing more." Epictetus then continues along the same
lines:
"His ship sank."
"What happened?"
"His ship sank."
" He was sent to prison." But if you add the proposition "a terrible
thing happened to him," then that is coming from you.
What Epictetus means is that the idea according to which a certain
event is a misfortune-as well as the consequences that such a representation
may have on the desires and tendencies of the soul-is a representation
which has no basis in reality; rather, it goes beyond an adequate
vision of reality, by adding to it a false value-judgment. Such a representation
can arise only in a soul which has not yet assimilated the
86 THE I N NER CITADEL
fundamental dogma of Stoicism: happiness is only to be found in moral
good, or virtue; and misfortune is only to be found in moral evil, in faults
and in vice.
If the only good is moral good, and the only evil is moral evil, how
can the Stoic live his daily life, in which there are many things which are
morally neither good nor evil, but are "indifferent," to use a term from
the Stoic vocabulary? A person must, after all, eat, sleep, work, raise a
family, and fulfill his or her role within the community. The Stoic, too,
must act; and he or she has an impulse-both instinctive and rational-to
act. Thus, the second of the soul's proper functions, coming after the
activity of representations, judgments, and assent, must be just this impulse
to act, as well as action itself The domain of the latter includes what
Epictetus and the Stoics call the kathekonta; that is, those actions which,
in all probability and for good reason, may be considered as "appropriate
" to human nature. These are the actions which conform to the
deep-rooted instinct which urges rational human nature to act in order
to preserve itself Thus, both the active impulse and action itself will be
exercised above all in the domain of society, of the state, of the family,
and of relations between human beings in general.
Human action cannot, however, hope to be completely effective; it
does not always attain its goal. Mankind is, therefore, reduced to hoping
and to desiring that what suits him actually happens, and that that which
he fears does not. Desire is thus the third activity proper to the human
soul, and its domain is not that which one does oneself, but rather that
which happens-in other words, the events which happen to us by
virtue of Destiny, and the course of universal Nature. He who desires
does not act, but is in a certain disposition of waiting. As was the case
with the impulse to action, desire depends on us, and the soul is free
either to desire a given object, or not to desire it.
The philosopher, then, must train himself in these three domains of
activity: judgment, impulse toward action, and desire (III, 2, 1-2) :
There are three domains in which he who would become perfect
must train himself
-the domain concerning desires and aversions, so that he may not
find himself frustrated in his desires, and may not encounter that
which he was seeking to avoid;
-the domain concerning active impulses and repulsions, and in
general, the domain which concerns what is appropriate (kathekon)
for our nature, so that he may act in an orderly way, in accordance
The Stoicism of Epictetus
with rational probability, and without negligence;
-the domain in which what matters is to preserve oneself from
error and insufficient reasons; and, in general, that which concerns
the assent [which we give to judgments] .
If we gather together all the indications concerning this theme contained
in Epictetus' sayings, we can present this
_
theory of the three forms
or domains20 of philosophical exercise as follows:
The first domain is that of desires and aversions. Humans are unhappy
because they desire things which they consider good, but which they
may either fail to obtain or else lose; and because they try to avoid things
which they consider as evils, but which are often inevitable. The reason
is that these apparent goods and evils-wealth and health, for example,
or on the contrary poverty and sickness-do not depend on us. Thus, the
exercise of the discipline of desire will consist in gradually renouncing
these desires and aversions, so that we may finally desire only that which
does depend on us-in other words, moral good-and may avoid only
that which depends on us-in other words, moral evil. That which does
not depend on us is to be considered as indifferent, which means that we
are not to introduce any preferential order among such things, but accept
them as willed by the will of universal Nature, which Epictetus sometimes
designates by the term "gods" in general. To "follow the gods"
means to accept their will, which is identical with the will of universal
Nature (I, 12, 8; I, 20, I 5) . The discipline of desire thus has as its object
the passions (pathe), or the emotions which we feel when events present
themselves to us.
The second domain of exercises is that of impulses to action. As we have
seen, it is the field of those actions which are " appropriate " (kathekonta)
to our rational nature. These are actions-and therefore something
which depends on us-that have an effect on things which do not depend
on us, such as other human beings, politics, health, family life, and
so forth. All of these areas are, in themselves, "indifferent" in the Stoic
sense of the term; but they may, in accordance with a rational justification
or reasonable probability, be considered as corresponding to reasonable
nature's instinct for self-preservation. Since such actions are directed
exclusively toward other people, and have their foundation in that community
of reasonable nature which unites humankind, they must be
guided by our intention to place ourselves in the service of the human
community, and bring about the reign of justice.
The third domain of exercises is that of assent (sunkatathesis). Each
88 THE I N NER CITA D EL
representation (phantasia) which presents itself to us must be subjected to
criticism, so that our inner dialogue and the judgment we enunciate with
regard to it may not add anything "subjective " to that which, within the
representation, is "adequate " to reality; only thus will we be able to give
our assent to a true judgment. We have already seen the importance of
this theme in Stoicism, for which good and evil are not to be found
anywhere else than in our faculty of judgment.
It is tempting to compare the three acts of the soul as distinguished by
Epictetus-rational activity of judgment and assent, impulse to action,
and desire-with the three parts of the soul recognized by the Platonists.
Following Plato, they distinguished between the rational part of the soul,
its " choleric " part, which is the seat of action, and the " desiring" part,
which is the principle of pleasure and of passion. This comparison is all
the more attractive in that Plato, like Epictetus, based his system of
virtues, and therefore, in a sense, his "ascetic " system, on his distinction
of the parts of the soul. For Epictetus, as we have seen, there is a
discipline of the soul's intellectual activity, a discipline of impulses and
tendencies to action, and a discipline of desire. In Plato's Republic, justice
is the inner harmony of the individual as well as of the state, and it
consists in the union of three elements: the first is wisdom, which, in the
soul, reigns over the rational part, and in the state is the characteristic of
the philosopher-kings. Within the soul, courage reigns over the "choleric
" and impulsive part; whereas within the state it pertains to the class
of warriors. Finally, that temperance which is to be found within the soul
reigns over the " desiring" part; whereas within the state it must be the
characteristic of the lowest class: that of the artisans.
21
In spite of these analogies, however, the schemes of Plato and of
Epictetus are radically and completely different. For Plato, there is a
hierarchy among the parts of the soul analogous to that which is established
between the classes of society in the Republic: rulers, warriors, and
artisans. The philosopher-kings impose their rule upon the warriors and
artisans, who are their inferiors. In the same way, good reason imposes its
law upon the inferior parts of the soul.
For Epictetus, by contrast, both active impulse and desire are acts of
the rational soul, or the "guiding principle " within each human being.
There is thus no opposition or difference oflevel between rational activity,
impulses to action, and desire. Impulses and desire are located within
the rational soul itself; and this is all the more true in that impulse and
desire, even if they do have affective repercussions upon the soul, are,
according to Stoic teaching, essentially judgments made by the rational
soul. Reason is not essentially good; rather, like impulses and desire, it
The Stoicism of Epictetus
can be either good or bad, according to whether it emits true or false
judgments, which then determine conduct. A passage from Plutarch22
provides a good summary of Stoic doctrine as we find it in Epictetus:
For the Stoics, virtue is a disposition of the ruling part of the soul
... or rather it is reason when the latter is coherent with itself, firm,
and constant. They do not believe that the passionate and irrational
parts of the soul differ from the rational faculty by means of a natural
difference; but that it is the same part of the soul, which they call
dianoia and hegemonikon (the faculty of reflection and the directing
principle) which changes and is completely transformed in the passions
and the transformations which it undergoes, either in its state
or in its dispositions, and that it becomes vice or virtue. In itself,
however, there is nothing irrational about this faculty, but it is called
irrational when, owing to excessive impulses, it becomes very
strong and triumphant, and is consequently led to something inappropriate
and contrary to the choice of reason. Passion, thus, is
reason, but reason which is vitiated and depraved, and which,
owing to the effect of bad and perverted judgment, has acquired
strength and vigor.
For Plato, we can say that the essence of human beings resides in
reason; and reason is necessarily right, but the life of the concrete individual
does not necessarily coincide with it. For Epictetus, by contrast, as
for the Stoics in general, the essence of mankind does consist in reason,
the principle of freedom, and the power to choose. Precisely because it is
the power to choose, however, it can be either good or bad and is not
necessarily right.
Impulse and desire are thus located within the " directing principle,"
or center of the human soul's freedom. For this reason, they are on the
same level as the rational faculty of judgment and of assent. Obviously,
however, judgment, impulse, and desire are not interchangeable. Each
impulse and each desire has its foundation and its origin in a judgment. It
is as a function of its inner discourse that the soul feels a certain impulse
to action, or a certain inner disposition of desire .
The three exercise-themes and the three parts of philosophy
For the Stoics, as we have seen, there is not only a discourse about logic,
but a lived logic. Likewise, there is not only a discourse about ethics, but
also a lived ethics; there is not only a discourse about physics, but also a
90 THE I N NER CITADEL
lived physics. In other words, philosophy, insofar as it is the conduct of
life, is indissolubly logic, ethics, and physics. We can recognize this lived
logic, ethics, and physics in the three exercises of Epictetus which we
have just examined.
It is worth noting that, in order to designate these exercises,
Epictetus23 uses the word topos, a term traditionally used by the Stoics-at
least since the time of Apollodoros of Seleucia, who flourished at the end
of the second century B.C.-to designate the parts of philosophy.24 When
the Stoics spoke of the parts of philosophical discourse, they were probably
using the word topos in a rhetorical and dialectical sense, in which it
signified a thesis, or a "general question which is put up for discussion. "25
In the same way as a rhetorical or dialectical topos was a theme for
exercises in the area of discourse, so Epictetus' three topoi are three
themes of intellectual exercise, which correspond to the three parts of
philosophical discourse. At the same time, however, they are also three
themes of lived exercise, which put the principles formulated in philosophical
discourse into action, in the area oflife.
It is obvious that, for Epictetus, the discipline of judgment and of
assent corresponds to the logical part of philosophy, while the discipline
of impulses corresponds to the ethical part of philosophy. This equivalence
comes out clearly in a passage in which Epictetus opposes logic, on
the one hand, as a part of theoretical discourse, and on the other the
discipline of assent, as a lived logic. He then goes on to contrast ethics, as
a part of theoretical discourse, and the discipline of impulses, as a lived
ethics. The context is a section of the Discourses (IV, 4, r r-18) in which
Epictetus is criticizing the false philosopher, who is content merely to
read theoretical discourses about philosophy. Epictetus reminds his audience
that "Life is made up of other things besides books," and then
proceeds as follows:
It is as if, in the domain (topos) of the exercise of assent, when we are
in the presence of representations of which some are " adequate "
(kataleptikai) and the others are not, we were to refuse to distinguish
the ones from the others, but preferred to read treatises entitled On
Comprehension. What, then, is the reason for this? It is because we
have never read, and we have never written, so as to be capable, in
a context of action, to use the representations which actually do
present themselves to us in a manner in conformity with nature.
Rather, we have confined ourselves to learning what is said, and
being able to explain it to someone else; we've learned how to
resolve a syllogism and how to examine a hypothetical argument.
The Stoicism of Epictetus 91
As we can see, Epictetus is here opposing two kinds oflogic; theoretical
logic, as it is contained in treatises with titles like On Comprehension,
gives us only a theoretical knowledge and technical skill in argumentation,
which bears no relationship to reality. Opposed to this stands lived
logic, which consists in criticizing, and entering into dialogue with, the
representations which actually do present themselves to us in the course
of everyday life. Similarly, Epictetus goes on, we should not be concerned
with reading treatises entitled On Impulses, in order to find out
what people have to say about impulses, but rather we should get busy
and act. Here, the theoretical ethics contained in treatises on impulse
and-Epictetus adds-on duty is placed in relation to the exercise of the
discipline of impulse.
The correspondence between logic and the discipline of assent, then,
can be easily admitted; as can that between ethics and the discipline of
impulses. What, however, shall we say about the discipline of desire? The
structure of the Stoic scheme of the three parts of philosophy seems to
require that it correspond to physics. Is this possible? Seemingly not; in
the first place, Epictetus makes no allusion to any particular relationship
between physics and the discipline of desire in the passage quoted above,
although he does relate the discipline of judgment to logic, and the
discipline of impulses to ethics. Instead, he merely speaks of theoretical
treatises entitled On Desire and Aversion, which seem to be ethical treatises.
If it is true, however, that the abstract theory of " desire " itself,
insofar as it is an act of the soul, is situated within the domain of ethics,
nevertheless the lived practice of the discipline of desire implies, in the
last analysis, a specific attitude toward the cosmos and nature. I have
already hinted at this point in my account of the content of the three
disciplines, but must now be more specific. The discipline of desire has as
its goal to bring it about that we never desire things of which we might
be frustrated, and that we never flee that which we might undergo
against our will. This discipline therefore consists in desiring only the
good which depends upon us-the only thing that is truly good, for the
Stoics-and just as much in fleeing only moral evil. As for that which
does not depend on us: we are to accept it, as willed by universal Nature
(II, 1 4, 7) :
Here is approximately what we think the philosopher's task is. He
must adapt his own will to events, in such a way that, among all
events which occur, there may be none which occur when he did
not want them to occur, and that, of all events which do not occur,
there may be none which does not occur when he wanted it to
92 THE I N NER CITADEL
happen. The result, for those who have undertaken this task, is that
they are not frustrated in their desires, and that they are not forced
to undergo that for which they have an aversion.
The continuation of this passage still describes the task of the philosopher,
but now with regard to his relations with others. We have here,
then, a very clear linkage between the discipline of desire and the consent
willed by destiny. Such consent presupposes that mankind recognize
himself as a part of the All, and that he understand that events are
necessarily linked to one another by the will of universal Reason. Whatever
happens, Epictetus recommends, one should not become irritated
against the events that have been disposed by Zeus himself [that is to
say, by universal Reason] ; he has defined them and placed them in
order in cooperation with the Moirae [i. e., the Fates] , who were
present at your birth and have woven your destiny. Don't you
know how tiny a part you are, compared to the All? (I, 12, 25).
Elsewhere, Epictetus writes in the same vein (II, 17, 25) :
Let your desires and your aversions become attached to Zeus, and
to the other gods; give them to them, let them govern them, and let
this desire and this aversion be ranged in accordance with them.
Consent to destiny and obedience to the gods-the essential components
of the discipline of desire--presuppose that man become aware of
his place within the All, and consequently that he practice physics. "The
consent to Destiny," writes A.-J. Voelke,26 "requires first of all that the
universe be understood, thanks to an effort of thought in which intellectual
power bases itself upon sense-representations .... The result of this
methodical elucidation is that, little by little, we arrive at the rational
certainty that we are living in a cosmos which is good, and set in harmonious
order by a supreme Providence." We shall see later that, in the
writings of Marcus Aurelius, this theme of the link between the discipline
of desire and physics lived as a spiritual exercise is orchestrated even
more richly than in the sayings of Epictetus which have come down to
us.27
Sometimes Epictetus places the three disciplines on the same level, but
he also sometimes seems to establish a hierarchy among them. Consequently,
he sometimes enumerates the three disciplines without estab-
The Stoicism of Epictetus 93
lishing any determinate order among them, as for example when he
begins with the discipline of assent (I, 17, 22; IV, 4, 14ff; IV, 6, 26) .
Elsewhere, by contrast, he speaks of first, second, and third themes of
exercise (topoi): the first being that of desires, the second that of impulses,
and the third that of assent. In Epictetus' view, this order corresponds to
different phases of spiritual progress. From this perspective, it is the
discipline of desire, and then that of impulses, which must come first and
which are the most necessary (I, 4, 1 2). The discipline of assent now
comes only in third place, and is reserved for those who are making
progress (III, 2, 5; III, 26, 14; IV, IO, 1 3), since it ensures them firmness in
their assenting. Nevertheless, we can sense that for Epictetus, the disciplines
of desire and of impulse are fused together into the discipline
which criticizes representations, and therefore in the discipline of judgment
and assent. After all, for Epictetus, who is here being entirely
faithful to Stoic orthodoxy, the cause of our passions-that is to say, of
our desires-as well as of our actions-that is, of our impulses-is nothing
other than representations (phantasiai}-in other words, the ideas we
form of things. All the tragedies and dramas in the world are the simple
result of the false ideas of events that the heroes of these tragedies and
dramas have formed for themselves (I, 28, rn-33). If this is true, however,
the exercise-theme which has as its object the criticism of representations
and judgment ought to come first.
In fact, this apparent confusion is, once again, the result of differences
in perspective: differences introduced, on the one hand, by the concrete,
lived practice of philosophy, and on the other by the orderly progression
demanded by the teaching of philosophy. In practice, it is indeed the
criticism of our representations, and the correction of the false ideas
which we form about things, which is the most urgent task, because it
conditions the control of our desires and our impulses. We cannot wait
to practice the discipline of judgment and of assent until, at the end of
our program of studies, we have begun the study of texts on theoretical
logic, or the examination of hypothetical syllogisms and sophisms. The
urgency of life does not permit such niceties, and, in the words of
Epictetus, "life is made up of other things besides books." In everyday
life, the discipline of desire, the discipline of impulses, and the discipline
of judgment are inseparable, and are but three aspects of one activity,
which Epictetus calls "the right way of using (chresis)" representations (II,
1 9, 32; 22, 29) ; that is to say, the right way of examining the value and
correctness of the ideas which we form of things, which are the causes of
our desires and impulses.
94 THE I N NER CITA D EL
And yet these three disciplines are taught, which means they are the
object of a theoretical discourse which, if it is well assimilated by the
disciple, contributes to his spiritual progress. Here again the matter is
urgent-but from another point of view. The exercise-themes which are
to be given top priority are those which will allow the disciple to live
philosophically: the discipline of desire, which delivers us from "worries,
agitations, and grief" (III, 2, 3), and the discipline of impulse, which
teaches us to live within our family and our city. "These," says Epictetus
(I, 4, 12), " are the exercise-themes which must come first, and which are
the most necessary." In theoretical teaching, then, the discipline of desire,
which is the first exercise-theme, will correspond to physics; the
second-the discipline of active impulses-will correspond to ethics, and
in particular to the theory of appropriate duties and actions (kathekonta).
Once again, then, we return to the relationship between theoretical
physics and that lived physics which we have identified as the discipline
of desire. In order for the philosopher to be able to discipline his desires,
he must understand the Stoic theory of nature. As Chrysippus28 himself
had already said:
There is no more appropriate way to arrive at the theory of goods
and of evils, virtues and wisdom, than by starting out from universal
Nature and the organization of the world . . . for the theory of
goods and evils must be connected to these subjects ... and physics
is taught only so that we may be able to teach the distinction which
must be established between goods and evils.
It is precisely upon this distinction between goods and evils that the
discipline of desire is based, and this is why we encounter this intimate
link between physics and the theme of the exercice of desire in Epictetus.
Epictetus, moreover, also makes an explicit reference to Chrysippus (I,
IO, r o) :
Please examine what, according to Chrysippus, is the administration
of the world, and what place rational animals occupy therein. Then,
from this point of view, consider who you are, and what good and
evil are for you.
In the Discourses of Epictetus as reported by Arrian, we do not find
lengthy considerations of this series of questions, which must have corresponded
to an entire program of studies. Often, however, we can recog-
The Stoicism of Epictetus 95
nize in passing Epictetus' allusions to this essential part of the discourse
on the teaching of physics, such as the following passage (IV, 7, 6) :
God has made everything that is in the universe and the universe in
its entirety, free of constraint and independent; but he made the
parts of the Whole for the sake of the Whole. Other beings lack the
capability of understanding the divine administration; but rational
beings possess the inner resources which allow them to reflect upon
this universe. They can reflect that they are a part of it, and on what
kind of a part they are; and that it is good for the parts to yield to the
Whole.
Becoming aware, by means of the study of physics, of our situation as
parts of the Whole does not just serve the function of providing a theoretical
and rational foundation for the discipline of desire, which, as we
have seen, requires that, precisely because we are parts of the Whole, we
must desire everything that happens as a result of the natural course of
Nature. On the contrary, it also means enjoying the spectacle of the
entire universe, and looking at the world with the vision of God himself
In another passage, Epictetus describes the solitary meditation of God at
the moment when, at the end of one of the periodic cycles of the
Universe, he remains alone, since for a moment all things have been
reabsorbed into him-that is to say, into the original fire which is at the
same time the logos which produces the world-and he urges us to
imitate him (III, 13, 7) :
As Zeus is with himself, rests in himself, thinks about the way in
which he administers the world, and is plunged in thoughts worthy
of himself; so too should we converse with ourselves: with no need
of others, and without being worried about how to keep our lives
busy. We, too, should reflect on the way in which God administers
the world, and on our relation to the rest of the world; we should
consider what our attitude has been, up until now, toward things
that happen; and on what it is now; we should consider what are
the things that cause us pain, and how we could best remedy
them ....
Here we switch, with complete naturalness, from a v1s1on of the
universe to an examination of conscience. The latter is related to the
discipline of desire, and to our attitude with regard to the events that
THE I N NER CITADEL
happen to us by virtue of the general movement of the universe. As
Epictetus says later on (IV, r , r oo-ror ) :
This body made of mud: how could God have created it free of
impediments? He therefore submitted it to the revolution of the
Universe, as he did with my possessions, my furniture, my house,
my children, and my wife. Why, then, should I fight against God?
Why should I wish for things that ought not to be wished for?
It is thus no good complaining, and blaming him who has given us all
for taking away from us that which he has given (IV, I, 1 03-4) :
Who are you, and why have you come here? Isn't it God who has
introduced you down here? Isn't it he who has made the light shine
for you ... and who has given you reason and the senses? In what
condition, moreover, has he introduced you down here? ... Was it
not so as to live on earth with a miserable piece of flesh and, for a
little while, to contemplate his government, follow his procession,
and celebrate a festival with him?
Good people, therefore, will say when they are dying (III, 5, r o) :
I leave full of gratefulness to you, for you have judged me worthy of
celebrating the festival with you, of contemplating your works, and
of following together with you the way in which you govern the
world.
Finally, the discipline of desire, insofar as it is a lived physics, consists
not only in accepting what happens, but in contemplating the works of
God with admiration (I, 6, 1 9-25) :
God introduced humankind down here in order to contemplate
both him and his works ... For us, nature's final accomplishment is
contemplation, becoming aware, and a way of living in harmony
with nature. Make sure, then, that you do not die without having
contemplated all these realities ... will you never realize, then, who
you are, why you were born, and what this spectacle is to which
you have been admitted?
The first theoretical instruction in the education of a philosopher must
therefore be in physics, which forms the basis of the distinction between
The Stoicism of Epictetus 97
good and evil, and hence the discipline of desire. The second subj ect of
theoretical teaching is in ethics, which is the basis of the discipline of
impulses. Theoretical instruction in logic, which corresponds to what
Epictetus calls the " exercise-theme of assent," comes third.
We have here a good example of the way in which Epictetus viewed
two kinds of exercises as somehow fundamentally identical: intellectual
exercises, as practiced in the exposition of a given part of philosophical
discourse-in this case, logic-and lived exercises, as practiced in everyday
life-here, as the exercise-theme (topos) of judgment and assent.
Epictetus does, after all, use the same term, " the exercise-theme of assent,"
to designate both lived logic (the criticism of our representations
and of the ideas which we form of things) and, on the other hand,
theoretical logic (that is to say, the theory of syllogisms) .
On the one hand, Epictetus affirms (III, 1 2, 14-15):
The third exercise-theme concerns assent, and in particular seductive
and attractive representations. Just as Socrates used to say that an
unexamined life is not worth living, so we must never accept an
unexamined representation.
Thus, in this description of lived logic, or logic put into practice, we
recognize the proper use of representations which is, in fact, the basis and
foundation of all the other exercise-themes. Let me repeat: from this
lived and concrete point of view, the three themes are necessarily simultaneous;
and if Epictetus speaks of the "third theme," it is only for the
sake of clarity of exposition.
On the other hand, there are other passages in which the exercisetheme
of assent really is the third theme: it comes last after all the others,
and is reserved for those who are making progress (III, 2, 5) . In this case,
what is under discussion is theoretical/scholarly discourse about logic,
conceived as reasoning-processes which change in value-those which
end in one of the premises, hypothetical syllogisms, and deceptive reasoning
(III, 2, 6) . 29 Epictetus insists upon the absolute necessity of this
teaching; for instance, he responds as follows to an auditor who asks to be
persuaded of the usefulness of logic (II, 2 5, 1): "Without logic, how will
you know whether or not I am deceiving you with a sophism?" For
Epictetus, it is indispensable to be able to provide, by means of the art of
uncovering sophisms and errors in reasoning, the dogmas one has received
via instruction in physics and ethics with an unshakably firm
foundation. Such logic may be sterile (I, 1 7, r n) ; it is a purely critical
THE I N NER CITADEL
discipline, which teaches no dogma, but examines and criticizes everything
else.
In the final analysis, one gets the impression that, for Epictetus, the
place of logic in a philosophical education is situated at two moments:
the beginning and the end. It has its place at the beginning, because, as
we have seen, in order to be able to practice the three themes of philosophical
exercise, it is indispensable to learn, as soon as possible, how to
criticize one's representations, and how to give one's assent only to those
which are adequate. "This," says Epictetus, "is the reason why we place
logic at the beginning" (I, 1 7, 6) . Logic also, however, has its place at the
end of the curriculum, in its more technical form of the theory of
syllogisms; this is what gives unshakable certainty to the dogmas, which
are the principles of action (III, 26, 14). The danger of this technical
study, however, is that it may remain purely technical, and become an
end in itself or a means of showing off (III, 2, 6; I, 26, 9; II, 1 9, 5) . In such
a case, the third exercise-theme may become deleterious to a philosophical
education.
As we can see, reconciling the demands of concrete philosophical life
with those of pedagogical and theoretical education was very difficult for
Epictetus, as it was for the other Stoics as well. He probably restricted
himself to the combined teaching of all three disciplines. Nevertheless,
the doctrine of the three topoi, or lived exercise-themes, appears in
Epictetus' teachings as the final development of the Stoic theory of the
three parts of philosophy. Epictetus enunciates a philosophical discourse
on the subject of these three parts, but at the same time he also finds
them within the everyday life of philosophers. Here, they assume the
form of three exercise-themes, linked to the three activities of the soul;
for the discipline of desire is possible only by means of that awareness by
virtue of which the philosopher considers himself as a part of the cosmic
All. Likewise, the discipline of impulses is possible only by means of that
awareness by virtue of which the philosopher discovers his place within
the human community; while the discipline of assent is possible only
thanks to the awareness by means of which the philosopher simultaneously
discovers, on the one hand, his liberty with regard to representations,
and, on the other, the rigorous laws of Reason.
The coherence of the All
Most historians of philosophy mention Epictetus' doctrine of the three
exercise-themes. For instance, they have recognized that Arrian used this
The Stoicism of Epictetus 99
scheme of the three exercise-themes in order to group together those
sayings of Epictetus which he collected in the summary of the Master's
teachings which he entitled the Manual. 30 Scholars have also sought to
discover traces of analogous schemes in Seneca or Cicero,31 but it appears
that we shall never arrive at decisive results concerning this point. Despite
all these efforts, however, scholars have perhaps not sufficiently
emphasized the human significance of this doctrine.
The discipline of desire essentially consists in re-placing oneself within
the context of the cosmic All, and in becoming aware of human existence
as being a part, one that must conform to the will of the Whole,
which in this case is equivalent to universal Reason. The discipline of
impulses and of actions consists essentially in re-placing oneself within
the context of human society; this entails acting in conformity with that
Reason which all human beings have in common, and which is itself an
integral part of universal Reason. Finally, the discipline of judgment
consists in allowing oneself to be guided by the logical necessity which is
imposed upon us by that Reason which is within ourselves; this Reason,
too, is a part of universal Reason, since logical necessity is based upon the
necessary linkage of events.
Thus, the scheme of Epictetus' exercise-themes has exactly the same
goal as did the three aspects of lived philosophy-physics, ethics, and
logic-for the Stoics: to live "in accordance with Reason." There is
nothing surprising about this, since, as we have seen, Epictetus holds that
the three exercise-themes are the three aspects of lived philosophy. The
philosopher must abandon his partial, egoistic vision of reality, in order,
by way of physics, to rise to the point of seeing things as universal
Reason sees them. Above all, the philosopher must intensely wish the
common good of the universe and of society, by discovering that a part
can possess no other proper good than the common good of the All. The
philosopher is a citizen of the world (I, 9, l; II, I O, 3); but he or she is also
a citizen of the human City (II, 5, 26) , which is nothing other than a
smaller image of the cosmic City. If one's individual consciousness can be
expanded as far as the utmost limits of the cosmic event, and wills this
wholly and completely, this still does not prevent one from assuming the
responsibilities of social duties, nor from having a profound love for the
human community. If my Reason has come forth from universal Reason,
then so has that of all other human beings. All people are brothers
and sisters since they share in the same Reason; and even a slave is thus
his master's brother (I, 13, 3).
Epictetus' three disciplines, therefore, guide and direct the relations
100 THE I N NER CITADEL
between human beings and the universe, other human beings, and humankind's
own reason. Thus, the totality of human existence is situated
in relation to the whole of reality. For the Stoics, moreover, totality is
precisely what characterizes living beings; in their view, to be a whole is
to be coherent with oneself By means of the three disciplines, people
freely cooperate with a totality and a coherence which will necessarily be
actualized, whether they like it or not, for it is only the totality of the
cosmos which is assured of a perfect, unbreakable coherence. Although
humankind's freedom confers upon it the privilege of being able to
conform, freely and voluntarily, to this rational coherence of the cosmos,
it also exposes humanity to the risk of allowing incoherence to infiltrate
its thought, its affectivity, and the human City as a whole. Humankind's
adherence to the coherence of cosmic Reason is always fragile and in
doubt, but the divine plan will be realized of necessity.
The doctrine of the three exercise-themes, disciplines, or rules of life
thus contains within itself the whole essence of Stoicism, recapitulated in
a grandiose way. It invites humankind to a complete reversal of its vision
of the world and its usual way of living. The philosopher-emperor Marcus
Aurelius, as the distant disciple of the philosopher-slave, would magnificently
develop and orchestrate these richly-harmonied themes in his
Meditations.
6
THE I N NER CITA D EL, OR
THE DISC IPLINE OF ASSENT
The discipline of assent
As we have seen, the Meditations are Stoic spiritual exercises. We can,
however, be more specific: by means of these exercises, Marcus Aurelius
wished to establish within himself the inner discourse and the profound
dispositions which would allow him to practice concretely-in the midst
of his imperial life-the three exercise-themes or rules of life set forth by
Epictetus. The Meditations return constantly to the formulation of these
exercise-themes, and of the dogmas which serve as their foundation. The
structure underlying the Meditations is the very same ternary structure
that we have just seen in the case of Epictetus, and we must now turn to
examining the form which this structure takes on in the Meditations.
The objective or adequate representation (phantasia kataleptike)
The discipline of assent consists essentially in refusing to accept within
oneself all representations which are other than objective or adequate. In
order to understand what Marcus Aurelius means by this, it is necessary
to specify the meaning of the technical Stoic vocabulary which the
Emperor uses in this context.
In the first place, sensation (aisthesis) is a corporeal process which we
have in common with animals, and in which the impression of an exterior
object is transmitted to the soul. By means of this process, an image
(phantasia) of the object is produced in the soul, or more precisely in the
guiding part (hegemonikon) of the soul.
The phantasia has a double aspect. On the one hand, it replaces the
object, and in a sense becomes identified with it, since it is an image of
the object. On the other hand, it is a modification (pathos) of the soul,
brought about by the action of an exterior object. Marcus Aurelius, for
102 THE I N NER CITADEL
instance, asks himself the following question (III, r r, 3; XII, r 8) : "What
is the nature of the object which is producing this phantasia within me?"
In the summary of Stoic logic which the historian Diogenes Laertius
has preserved for us, we read the following: "The phantasia comes first,
and then reflection (dianoia) which enunciates what it feels as a result of
the phantasia, and expresses it in discourse. "1 The presence of this image
in the soul is thus accompanied by an inner discourse; that is to say, a
phrase, proposition, or series of phrases and propositions which enunciate
the nature, quality, and value of the object which has given rise to the
phantasia in question. It is to these enunciations that we may either give
or withhold our assent. Like exterior objects, the phantasia is corporeal,
but the inner discourse to which we give our assent is incorporeal,
insofar as it possesses a meaning. By contrast with the passive nature of
the phantasia-the image or representation produced by exterior objects-this
inner discourse represents an activity of the guiding part of the
soul. The soul, moreover, can also produce representations (phantasiai)
when it combines the images it has received. 2
This double aspect of the cognitive process-passive and active, constrained
and free-can be observed in a passage by Epictetus quoted by
Aulus Gellius.3 It deserves to be cited in its entirety, since it gives a good
description of the mechanism of assent:
These representations of the soul, which the philosophers call phantasiai,
by which a person's spirit is momentarily moved, at the first
glimpse of the thing which presents itself to the soul: they do not
depend upon the will, and are not free. Rather, by means of some
kind of force which is peculiar to them, they throw themselves
upon people, in order to be known.
Assents, by contrast, which are called sunkatatheseis, by means of
which these representations are recognized and judged, are voluntary
and take place through human freedom.
This is why, when a terrifying sound is heard-whether it comes
from the heavens or from the collapse of some building, or whether
it announces some kind of danger, or anything else of that natureit
is necessary that the soul of the sage, too, be also slightly moved
and constricted and terrified; not because he judges that some form
of evil is present, but because of the rapid and involuntary movements,
which usurp the proper task of the mind and of reason.
The sage, however, does not give his assent immediately to such
representations which terrify his soul; he does not approve them,
The Discipline of Assent 103
but brushes them aside and rejects them, and it seems to him that
there is nothing to fear from such things. This is the difference
between the sage and the foolish person: the foolish person thinks
that things are as they appear to the first emotion of his soul-that is
to say, atrocious and frightful, and the foolish person approves by his
assent these first impressions, which appear to justify his fear.
But the sage, although the color of his face was briefly and rapidly
altered, does not give his assent, but maintains the force and solidity
of the dogma which he has always had about such representations:
that they are not at all to be feared, but they terrify people by means
of a false appearance and an empty terror.
This text provides a fairly clear distinction between the image (phantasia-in
this case, the thunderclap which resounds within the soul) ; the
judgment (which Marcus calls a hypolepsis) , which is an inner discourse of
the form: "This is awful and terrible!"; and finally the assent (sunkatathesis),
which either approves or fails to approve the judgment.
Marcus has a frequent tendency to confuse judgment and representation;
in other words, he identifies representations with the inner
discourse which enunciates their content and their value. We may omit
the passage in Book V, 16, 2, where Marcus speaks of a chain of representations,
even though what is being discussed is a syllogism, and hence
a chain of judgments: for in this particular case one can admit that he is
speaking of those phantasiai logikai, or abstract representations, which I
have alluded to above as the result of intellectual operations. Elsewhere,
however, we find Marcus saying either (VIII, 29) : "Erase your representations
(phantasiai), " or else (VIII, 40) : " Suppress your judgment,"
without there being any apparent difference in meaning. And yet Marcus
is sometimes quite capable of distinguishing the inner discourse-and
hence the judgment-which the soul develops about a given representation,
from the representation itself (VIII, 49) :
Don't tell yourself anything more than what your primary representations
tell you. If you've been told, " So-and-so has been talking
behind your back," then this is what you've been told. You have
not, however, been told that " Somebody has done a wrong to you."
Here, we can recognize the stages of the process. In the first place, we
have the exterior event: someone announces to Marcus that so-and-so
has been saying negative things about him. Next, we have the repre-
THE I N NER CITADEL
sentation produced within him, which is called "primary" because as yet,
nothing has been added to it. In the third place, there is the discourse
which enunciates the contents of this primary representation: " So-and-so
has been saying negative things about you"; this is what is announced by
the primary representation. Finally, there is yet another enunciation,
which is no longer content merely to describe the situation, but emits a
value-judgment: "I have been wronged."
Here we encounter once again the notion of an " adequate" or " obj ective
" representation (phantasia kataleptike), as we have seen it defined by
Epictetus. An objective or adequate representation is one which corresponds
exactly to reality, which is to say that it engenders within us an
inner discourse which is nothing other than the pure and simple description
of an event, without the addition of any subjective value-judgment
(Arrian, Discourses, III, 8, 5) :
He was sent to jail.
What happened? He was sent to jail. But "He is unhappy" is added
by oneself [i. e., subjectively] .
Thus, both Marcus and Epictetus draw a clear distinction between "objective
" inner discourse, which is merely a pure description of reality,
and "subjective " inner discourse, which includes conventional or passionate
considerations, which have nothing to do with reality.
The "physical" definition
One must always make a definition or description of the object
which is presented in a representation, so as to see it in itself, as it is
in its essence, in its nakedness, in its totality, and in all its details.
One must say to oneself the name which is peculiar to it, as well as
the names of the parts which compose it, and into which it will be
resolved (III, r r ) .
Marcus Aurelius gives us several examples of what he means by this kind
of definition (VI, 13):
How important it is to represent to oneself, when it comes to fancy
dishes and other such foods: "This is the corpse of a fish, this other
thing the corpse of a bird or a pig." Similarly, "This Falernian wine
is just some grape juice," and "This purple vestment is some sheep's
The Discipline of Assent 105
hair moistened in the blood of some shellfish." When it comes to
sexual union, we must say, " This is the rubbing together of abdomens,
accompanied by the spasmodic ejaculation of a sticky liquid."
How important are these representations (phantasiai) which reach
the thing itself and penetrate right through it, so that one can see
what it is in reality.
Here again, Marcus uses the term phantasia to designate that inner
discourse which describes the object of representations. Yet these representations,
which appear to be discourses which "strike reality and penetrate
it through and through," correspond to " obj ective " or "adequate "
representations, as these are conceived by Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius.
They do not add anything to reality; rather, they define it in its nudity, by
separating it from the value-judgments which people feel obliged to add
to it, whether by habit, under the influence of social prejudices, or out of
passion.
We can call this kind of definition "physical," since it frees our representations
from every kind of subjective and anthropomorphic consideration,
as well as from every relation to the human point of view, in
order to define them, as it were, scientifically and physically. Once again
we note that, according to Stoic philosophy, all is in all. Although the
criticism of representations and the search for objective representations
are a part of logic, they can nevertheless only be achieved if we adopt a
physical point of view, by situating events and objects within the perspective
of universal Nature. It is for this reason that it will be necessary
to speak of this kind of definition once again, when we are dealing with
the discipline of desire.
The Inner Citadel
Things Cannot Touch the Soul
Things cannot touch the soul.
They have no access to the soul.
They cannot produce our judgments.
They are outside of us.
They themselves know nothing, and by themselves they affirm
nothing.
(Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, IV, 3, ro; V, r9; VI, 52; IX, r 5)
106 THE I N NER CITADEL
Marcus insists strongly and repeatedly on the total exteriority of things
with respect to us, and he does so in striking terms which do not appear
in the sayings of Epictetus which Arrian has preserved. When Marcus
says that "things cannot touch the soul," he does not mean that they are
not the cause of the representations (phantasiai) which are produced
within the soul. One could argue that, since the relationship between
things and their representations is that of cause and effect, it is a part of
the necessary linkage of Destiny. But the blow which sets the inner
discourse of the guiding principle in motion is only the opportunity for
this guiding principle to develop its inner discourse. The discourse itself,
however, remains entirely free:
Just as when you push a cylinder, says Chrysippus,4 you have caused
it to begin its movement, but you have not given it the property of
rolling, so likewise a representation will no doubt mark and imprint
its form upon the soul; and yet our assent will still remain within
our power. Just like the cylinder, our assent may be pushed from
without, but then it will move by its own force and nature.
The skeptic Sextus Empiricus5 confirms this twofold aspect of perception,
in the context of his criticism of the Stoics:
Perception (katalepsis) consists, according to them, in giving one's
assent to an objective (kataleptike) representation, and this seems to
be a twofold matter: there is something involuntary it, as well as
something voluntary, which depends upon our judgment. The act
of receiving a representation, for instance, is involuntary; it does not
depend upon the person receiving the representation, but upon the
cause of the representation .... Giving one's assent to such a psychological
movement, however, is within the power of the person
receiving the representation.
In order to understand what Marcus Aurelius means when he says that
things cannot touch the soul and are outside of us, we must bear in mind
that the word "soul" could have two meanings for the Stoics. In the first
place, it was a reality made of air (pneuma) which animates our body and
receives the impressions, or phantasiai, from exterior obj ects. This is often
what Marcus means by " soul." Here, however, when he speaks about
"us" and about the soul, he is thinking of that superior or guiding part of
the soul which the Stoics called the hegemonikon. It alone is free, because
The Discipline of Assent
it alone can give or refuse its assent to that inner discourse which enunciates
what the object is which is represented by a given phantasia. This
borderline which obj ects cannot cross, this inviolable stronghold of freedom,
is the limit of what I shall refer to as the "inner citadel." Things
cannot penetrate into this citadel: that is, they cannot produce the discourse
which we develop about things, or the interpretation which we
give of the world and its events. As Marcus says, the things outside of us
" stay still"; they " do not come to us"; rather, in a way, "it is we who go
toward them" (XI, I I).
These assertions must obviously be understood in a psychological and
moral sense. Marcus does not mean that things stay immobile in a physical
sense, but that they are "in themselves," in the sense in which "in
itself" could be opposed to "for itsel£ " Things do not care about us: they
do not try to influence us, penetrate within us, or trouble us. Besides,
"they know nothing about themselves and affirm nothing about themselves."
It is rather we who are concerned about things, who try to get to
know them, and who are worried about them. It is human beings who,
thanks to their freedom, introduce trouble and worry into the world.
Taken by themselves, things are neither good nor evil, and should not
trouble us. The course of things unfolds in a necessary way, without
choice, without hesitation, and without passion.
If you are grieving about some exterior thing, then it is not that
thing which is troubling you, but your judgment about that thing
(VIII, 47) .
Here we encounter an echo of a famous saying by Epictetus:
What troubles people is not things, but their judgments about
things (Manual, §s).
Things cannot trouble us, because they do not touch our ego; in other
words, they do not touch the guiding principle within us. They remain
on the threshold, outside of our liberty. When Marcus and Epictetus add
that "what troubles us is our judgment about things," they are clearly
alluding to the discourse which it is within our power to pronounce
within ourselves, in order to define for ourselves the meaning of a given
event. It is this latter judgment which may trouble us, but this is where
the fundamental dogma of Stoicism comes in: there is no good but moral
good, and there is no evil but moral evil. That which is not moral-that
108 THE I N NER CITAD EL
is to say, that which does not depend on our choice, our liberty, or our
judgment-is indifferent, and ought not to bother us. If our judgment
about things is troubling us, the reason is that we have forgotten this
fundamental dogma. The discipline of assent is thus intimately linked to
the doctrine of good, bad, and indifferent things (XI, 1 6):
To live one's life in the best way: the power to do this resides
within our soul, if we are capable of being indifferent to indifferent
things. And we can be indifferent to indifferent things if we consider
each of these things, in each of its parts and in its totality, remembering
that none of them can produce within us a value-judgment
about them, nor can they reach us. Rather, things remain immobile,
whereas it is we who engender judgments about them, and, as
it were, write them down within ourselves. But it is possible for us
not to write them down; it is also possible, if we have not succeeded
in this, to erase them instantaneously.
The soul is free to judge as it pleases
Things, therefore, should not have any influence upon the guiding principle
. Both Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius agree that the guiding principle
alone is responsible, whether it is troubled by things, or whether, on
the contrary, it is at peace. It is the guiding principle itself which modifies
itself, as it chooses this or that judgment about things, and consequently
this or that representation of the world. In the words of Marcus Aurelius
(who here uses the word "soul" to designate the superior, guiding part of
the soul; V, 1 9): "the soul modifies itself. " This concept was a part of
Stoicism well before the time ofEpictetus and Marcus, as is shown by the
following passage in Plutarch:6
It is the same part of the soul, which they call dianoia (faculty of
reflection) and hegemonikon (guiding principle) , which changes and
is totally transformed in the passions and transformations which it
undergoes ... they affirm that passion itself is reason, but depraved
and vicious reason, which, as a result of bad and mistaken judgment,
grows strong and vigorous.
Here we encounter another Stoic dogma: there is no opposition, as
the Platonists had held, between one part of the soul which is rational
The Discipline of Assent 109
and good in and of itself, and another part which is irrational and bad.
Rather, it is reason-and the ego itself-which becomes either good or
bad, as a function of the judgments which it forms about things. " It is the
soul which changes itself, according to whether it knows things, or fails
to know them. "7 This means that it is by its own judgment and decision
that the soul is in the right, or in error.
It must be understood that, for Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius, all of
the preceding must be situated in the order of the value which is attributed
to things, and not in the order of being. In order to clarify this, we
can use an example set forth by Marcus (VIII, 50): the cucumber that I
want to eat is bitter. Consequently, there is impressed upon my soul the
representation of a bitter cucumber, and the soul's guiding principle
should have only one thing to say about this representation: the assertion
"This cucumber is bitter." Here we can recognize an instance of the
objective and adequate representation (phantasia kataleptike). The entire
discipline of assent will therefore consist in my accepting only this one
objective representation. If, however, I were to add the question: "Why
are there such things in the world?" or the exclamation "Zeus is wrong
to allow such things!" then I am adding, freely and of my own accord, a
value-judgment which no longer corresponds to the adequate content of
my objective representation.
In Arrian's Manual (§ 5), the saying " It is not things that trouble people,
but their judgn1ents about things" is well explained by the following
commentary: " For instance, there is nothing fearful about death ...
rather, it is because of the judgment which we bring to bear upon
death-i.e., that it is fearful-that is what is fearful about death." Once
again, we have here a value-judgment which is added on in a purely
subjective way.
It is in the area of value-judgments that the power of the guiding
principle, and of its faculty of assent, comes into play. It is this power that
introduces value differences into a world which is indifferent and "in
itself. " Nevertheless, the only value-judgments which are authentic and
true are those which recognize that the good is moral good, that evil is
moral evil, and that that which is neither morally good nor bad is indifferent,
and therefore valueless. In other words, the Stoic definition of
good and evil has as its consequence the total transformation of one's
vision of the world, as it strips objects and events of the false values which
people have the habit of attributing to them, and which prevent them
from seeing reality in its nudity (VII, 68) :
1 10 THE I N NER CITADEL
True judgment says to that which presents itself: "this is what you
are in essence, even though you may appear to common opinion to
be something else."
However, although
the guiding principle has the power to bring it about that every
event appears to it in the way it wills (VI, 8) ,
this does not mean that the guiding principle can imagine anything it
pleases about reality, but rather that it is free to attribute what value it
wishes to the objects it encounters. In order to suppress the false value
which we attribute to these objects, it is enough to suppress our false
discourse about the value of these objects. If we suppress the inner
discourse which says "I have been harmed," then the harm disappears
and is suppressed (IV, 7) . As Epictetus had said (IV, 1, I Io) : "Do not tell
yourself that indifferent things are necessary to you, and they will no
longer be so."
Thus, when Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius speak of "judgments"
(hypolepsis), they are thinking of "value-judgments." This is why I have
usually translated hypolepsis as "value-judgment."
Critical idealism?
It is thus misleading to compare, as does Victor Goldschmidt,8 the affirmations
of Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius to a kind of "Kantian idealism,"
completely different from the theory of the objective or comprehensive
representation proposed by Chrysippus. For Chrysippus, writes
Goldschmidt, " comprehension was the natural consequence of assentaccorded
voluntarily but necessarily-to the comprehensive representation.
Now, as in Kantianism, comprehension applies more to appearances
than to the thing in itself It is we who elaborate upon the
appearance brought about by the object, and it is therefore this subjectivity,
deforming reality as it does, which we must study and criticize, much
more than reality itself ... it is as if the representation, which is no longer
comprehensive immediately and as a result only of the object, was now
rendered such by the activity of the subject." Goldschmidt, however,
failed to see that, for Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius, the activity of the
subject does not consist in producing a comprehensive or objective representation,
but rather in sticking to that which is objective within the
The Discipline of Assent III
obj ective representation, without adding to it any value-judgment which
might deform it. According to Epictetus (III, I2, I 5), we must say to
each of our representations:
Let's see some identification! Do you have the sign from nature
which every representation must have, in order to be approved?
This interrogation is not directed toward the obj ective and adequate
representation to which we spontaneously give our consent, but rather
to the other representations or judgments: those inner discourses we
pronounce not about the reality of the event or thing, but about its value.
It is the latter which lack the "ID" and the "sign" of an objective and
adequate representation.
The reason Goldschmidt gave this interpretation of Epictetus and of
Marcus Aurelius is that he has misunderstood a passage from Epictetus.
This passage is, to be sure, highly enigmatic at first sight (Manual, I, 5) :
Every time you are in the presence of an unpleasant representation,
practice saying to yourself: "You're only a representation (phantasia),
and not quite what you represent (to phainomenon). "
This, at any rate, is the translation proposed by Goldschmidt, but it is
incorrect. What is under discussion here is an "unpleasant" representation-that
is, one which gives the impression that an object or event
is painful, injurious, or terrifying. What this means is that the value-judgment
"this is unpleasant" has been added on to the objective representation
of an object or event. The representation is consequently no
longer objective, but subjective. A more accurate translation of
Epictetus' Greek would thus be "You are only a subjective representation,"
which is to say, "You are merely a pure representation" (or "a
mere product of my imagination," as we would put it today) , " and you
are not at all" ("not at all, "9 and not "not quite," as Goldschmidt translated)
"what really presents itself " Here, then, to phainomenon designates
the object as it is when it presents itself within an objective and adequate
representation-in other words, what is truly perceived.
The simultaneous discovery of oneself and of the world
In the last analysis, then, the discipline of assent appears as a constant
effort to eliminate all the value-judgments which we bring to bear upon
1 12 THE INNER CITA D EL
those things which do not depend upon us, and which therefore have no
moral value. The phenomena of nature and the events of the world,
once they are stripped of all the adjectives-" terrifying," "frightening,"
" dangerous," "hideous," " repulsive "-which humankind, in its blind
anthropomorphism, applies to them, appear in their nudity and all their
savage beauty. All reality is then perceived from the perspective of universal
Nature, as within the flow of eternal metamorphoses of which our
individual life and death are only the tiniest waves. And yet, in the very
act by which we transform the way we used to look at things, we also
become aware of our ability to transform this way of seeing. Hence, we
become aware of the inner power which we possess to see things-and
by " things," let us always understand the value of things-as we want to
see them. In other words, thanks to the discipline of assent, the transformation
of our consciousness of the world brings about a transformation
of our consciousness of ourselves. And although Stoic physics makes it
seem as if events are woven inexorably by Fate, the self becomes aware of
itself as an island of freedom in the midst of a great sea of necessity. This
awareness consists in delimiting our true self, as opposed to what we used
to believe was our self, and we shall see that this is the necessary condition
for peace of mind. If I can discover that the selfI thought I was is not
the self I am, then nothing can get to me.
Circumscribing the self
Marcus Aurelius speaks several times of the need for the self and for the
guiding part of the soul to delimit and circumscribe themselves. On one
occasion, he takes the trouble to describe this exercise in detail (XII, 3):
There are three things of which you are composed: your body, your
vital breath, and your intellect (nous).
The first two are yours only insofar as you must take care of
them. Only the third is yours in the proper sense of the term.
This is why, if you separate yourself from yourself,
that is to say, from your thought (dianoia),
-everything that others may say or do;
-or again, everything that you yourself have said and done (in the
past) , as well as the things which trouble you because they are still to
come;
-and everything that happens to you, independently of your will,
The Discipline of Assent 1 13
because of the body which surrounds you, or your innate vital
breath;
-and everything which stirs the waves of the violent sea which
bathes you,
in order that
-raised above the interweavings of Fate,
-pure,
-free for itself,
the living intellectual power
-by doing what is right,
-by willing everything that happens,
-by telling the truth, --if, I say, you separate from this guiding principle (hegemonikon)
the things which have become attached to it, because it has become
attached to them,
and if you separate from time that which is beyond the present
and that which is past,
and if you make yourselflike the Sphairos ofEmpedocles, "a pure
orb, proud of its joyful uniqueness,"
and if you strive to live only what you live-that is to say, the
present, --then you will be able to live the time that is left to you, up
until your death, untroubled, benevolently and serenely with regard
to your inner daimon.
The exercise designed to circumscribe and delimit the self, then, begins
with the analysis of the components of human beings: the body; the
vital breath, or soul which animates the body; and the intellect. This last
is equivalent to our faculty of judgment and assent, our power ofreflection
(dianoia) or guiding principle �iegemonikon). We encounter this description
of the human being several times in Marcus (II, 2, l-3; II, 1 7,
l-4; III, 1 6, l; V, 33, 6; VII, 16, 3; VIII, 5 6, l; XI, 20; XII, 1 4, 5; XII, 26,
2) . At other times, the only things mentioned are the soul and the body,
with the soul being identified with the hegemonikon, as is clear from a
passage like VI, 3 2, in which soul and dianoia-and therefore
hegemonikon-are synonyms.
Traditional Stoic doctrine made a distinction between the body and
the soul, and further, within the soul, it distinguished a superior part: the
guiding part of the soul, in which the various psychic functions were
1 14 THE I N NER CITADEL
situated. Such a schema was purely dichotomous, in that it opposed soul
and body. It is easy to understand, however, how the Stoic doctrine of
the soul was able to evolve in the direction of the position we find taken
by Marcus Aurelius. The meaning of this evolution is well explained by a
passage from the Skeptic Sextus Empiricus:10
Some Stoics say that the word " soul" is used in two ways: on the
one hand, to designate that which holds together the entire mixture
of the body [this is what Marcus calls the pneuma, or vital breath] ,
and on the other, in a more proper sense, the guiding principle ....
In the division of good things, when we say that some things are
goods of the soul, others of the body, and others are exterior, we are
not referring to the soul in its entirety, but to that part of the soul
which is the guiding principle.
Although we encounter this splitting up of the soul into vital principle
and thinking principle in Marcus Aurelius, it does not seem that there is
any trace of the trichotomy proposed by Marcus in the sayings of
Epictetus as recorded by Arrian. It is, however, perhaps worth noting
that Epictetus (II, 1, 1 7) does use terminology analogous to that of
Marcus when he contrasts the body (designated by the diminutive term
somation) with the vital breath (designated by the diminutive pneumation) .
The general principle which presides over the exercise of the delimitation
of the self, which I am now describing, was formulated by Epictetus,
and placed by Arrian at the beginning of his Manual: the difference
between the things that depend on us and the things that do not depend
on us. In other words, it is the difference between inner causality, or our
faculty of choice-our inner freedom-and external causality, that is to
say, Destiny and the universal course of Nature.
The first step in the delimitation of the ego consists in recognizing
that, of the being which I am, neither the body, nor the vital breath
which animates it, is mine in the proper sense of the term. I must, of
course, take care of them: this is part of the doctrine of " duties" or
" actions appropriate " to nature. It is both natural and in conformity with
my instinct for self-preservation that I care for my body and the pneuma
which makes it live; but it is precisely this decision which I make concerning
these things which belong to me that belongs to a principle of
choice, and this principle of choice does belong to me in the proper sense.
The body and the vital pneuma are not completely mine, because they are
imposed upon me by Destiny, independently of my will. It might be
The Discipline of Assent 1 15
obj ected that the hegemonikon is also "given," but it is given as a source of
my initiative, or an "I" who decides.
In the passage quoted above, Marcus describes in a quite remarkable
way the different circles which surround the ego or the " I," as well as the
exercise which consists in rejecting them one by one, as something
foreign to my sel(
The first circle, and the most exterior, is the others. As Marcus says
elsewhere (III, 4, r):
Don't waste the part of life that remains to you in representations
(phantasiai) concerning other people, unless you relate them to
something which benefits the common good. Why do you deprive
yourself of the opportunity of accomplishing another task ... imagining
what so-and-so is doing, why he is doing it, what he thinks,
what he is plotting and all those other questions which make you
dizzy inside and turn you away from the attention which you
should be paying toward your own guiding principle (hegemonikon)?
The second circle is that of the past and the future. If we want to
become aware of our true selves, we must concentrate upon the present.
As Marcus puts it, we must " circumscribe the present," and separate
ourselves from that which no longer belongs to us: our past words and
actions, and our future words and actions. Seneca had already expressed
this idea: 11
These two things must be cut away: fear of the future, and the
memory of past sufferings. The latter no longer concern me, and
the future does not concern me yet.
Thus, neither the past nor the future depend upon me, and only the
present is within my power.
The third circle is constituted by the domain of involuntary emotions;
these are caused by impressions received by the body, and by the soul
considered as the principle of the body's animation, or "inborn vital
breath." In order to understand these involuntary emotions, let us recall
the passage alluded to earlier from the lost fifth book of Epictetus' Discourses,
as recorded by Arrian. In his Attic Nights, Aulus Gellius reports
that, during a sea voyage, he had seen a Stoic philosopher grow pale
during a storm, and when they arrived in port he had asked the philosopher
why he had experienced such a moment of weakness. At this, the
I I 6 THE INNER CITA D EL
philosopher had pulled Arrian's book out of his traveling bag, and
pointed to the passage in which Epictetus explained that if the sage
experienced a particularly strong and violent sensation, then he, too,
despite his wisdom, would experience an involuntary emotion which
would echo throughout the body and the rest of the soul. That, he
explained, was why the color of the sage's face might change, but, as
Epictetus had put it, "The sage does not give his assent to this emotion."
What this means is that when our rational consciousness or guiding
principle translates such an emotion into its inner discourse, and announces
that "This is terrible and appalling," then the guiding principle
immediately refuses to give its assent to this value-judgment. Let us note
in passing that this testimony is all the more interesting in that it lets us
glimpse how Epictetus, in those books written by Arrian which have
since become lost, spoke of themes very different from those which are
dealt with in the first four books. In the Discourses which have come
down to us, there does not seem to be any allusion to the sage's involuntary
movements.
In any case, Marcus Aurelius returns in another passage to the relation
between the guiding principle and involuntary movements (V, 26, 1):
Let the sovereign and directing part of your soul remain unaltered
in the presence of movements, whether gentle or violent, which are
produced in the flesh. Let it not be mixed with them, but let it
delimit itself and circumscribe these affections within the parts of
the body.
The guiding principle draws a border, as it were, between sensitive
emotions and its freedom of judgment, by refusing to consent or give its
assent to judgments which would attribute a positive or negative value to
the pleasures or pains that occur within the body. This border does not
prevent the guiding principle from perceiving everything that goes on
within the body, and thereby it ensures the unity of consciousness of the
entire living being, just as, within the cosmic living being, everything
goes back to the single consciousness of the guiding principle of the
universe (IV, 40) . From this new perspective, Marcus continues, we
cannot prevent sensations from penetrating within the guiding principle,
since they are natural phenomena; nevertheless, the guiding principle
must not add its own value-judgments concerning them.
On one hand, the guiding principle ensures the unity of living beings,
so that the sensations and emotions which I perceive are mine, since I
perceive them from within. On the other hand, however, the guiding
The Discipline of Assent 1 1 7
principle considers these sensations and emotions as somehow alien to
itself, insofar as it refuses to acquiesce and participate in the disturbances
which they introduce into the body. And yet, shouldn't the sage be
completely impassive, and the complete master of his body and of his
soul? This is how the Stoic sage is usually conceived. In fact, however,
the Stoic sage, as Seneca points out, 12 is far from being insensitive:
There are misfortunes which strike the sage-without incapacitating
him, of course-such as physical pain, infirmity, the loss of
friends or children, or the catastrophes of his country when it is
devastated by war. I grant that he is sensitive to these things, for we
do not impute to him the hardness of a rock or of iron. There is no
virtue in putting up with that which one does not feel.
This initial shock of emotion is the same movement, independent of
our will, of which Marcus Aurelius speaks. Seneca is quite familiar with
it, too:13
This is how passions are born, develop, and become excessive. First
of all, there is an initial involuntary movement; a kind of preparation
for and threat of passion. Then there is a second one, accompanied
by a desire which we are still able to reject: to wit, the idea that
"I have to get even because someone has done me wrong .... "
Finally, there is a third movement which can no longer be mastered
... we must have revenge at all costs. The first shock to the soul
cannot be avoided with the help of reason, any more than other
reflex movements which happen to the body, such as yawning ...
reason cannot vanquish them, but perhaps habit and constant attention
may attenuate them. The second movement, which arises from
a judgment, can be suppressed by a judgment.
According to the Stoics, then, even the sage himself cannot escape these
first involuntary movements. As Seneca puts it, 14 he always feels appearances
or "shadows of passions."
The fourth circle, a "rushing tide which bathes you with its waves," is
that of the course of events; in other words, it is the course of Destiny
and of the time in which Destiny unveils itself (IV, 43):
A river of all events, a violent current: that is what eternity is. No
sooner has each thing appeared than it has already passed; another
comes along, and it too will be swept away.
I I8 THE I N NER CITADEL
Elsewhere, Marcus writes (V, 23):
Think often of how quickly beings and events pass and disappear;
for substance is like a river in perpetual flux.
If, Marcus adds, we can recognize that all this flux of things and events
is alien to us, then we will be "raised above the tangled web of Destiny."
To be sure, our body and our vital breath are swept along by this flux,
and both our representations of things which are received into the body
and our vital breath belong to this flux, because they are produced by
causes outside of us. Yet the self becomes aware of the fact that, thanks to
its freedom of judgment-which also implies freedom of desire and of
the will-it stands apart from this flux. The self, then, identical with the
guiding principle, is raised above the web of destiny.
When the self thus becomes aware of its freedom, it acts only by
making its reason coincide with the Reason of universal Nature. It wants
that which happens; in other words, it wants what universal Nature
wants. The self now tells the truth, both inwardly and outwardly: in
other words, whenever a representation presents itself to the guiding
principle in order to obtain its assent, the self restricts itself to what is. It
holds fast to the objective representation, without adding value-judgments
to things which have no moral value. Finally, the self now does
what is right: that is, it acts in accordance with Reason, in the service of
the human community. Here (XIII, 3, 3) we recognize Epictetus' three
exercise themes (topoi), which, as we have seen, were taken up again by
Marcus Aurelius. To circumscribe and delimit one's self thus means to
practice the following exercises:
( r ) in the area of assent, it means not approving those value-judgments
which may be influenced by the body and the vital breath, which are
something other than myself;
(2) in the area of desire, it means recognizing that everything that does
not depend upon my moral choice is indifferent; and
(3) in the area of action, it means going beyond the egoistic concern for
my body and my vital breath, in order to rise up to the viewpoint of
Reason, which is common to all human beings; thus, it means willing
that which is beneficial to the common good.
After he has arrived at this culminating point, Marcus returns to the
theme of the delimitation of the self, in order to clarify certain aspects of
the process. The effort of concentration must make us aware of the fact
that things have become attached to us, and are no longer distinguishable
The Discipline of Assent 1 1 9
from us. Our self has become confused with such things, because we
have attached ourselves to them. Epictetus is fond of this theme of our
alienation toward things to which we attach ourselves (IV, 1, 1 1 2) :
Purify your judgments, so that nothing that is not "yours" may
become attached to you or become connatural with you, so that
you do not feel any suffering if it is snatched away from you.
Such objects are not " ours," Epictetus reminds us, not only because they
are different from us, but above all because they belong to Destiny and to
God, who are free to take them back after they have given them to us
(III, 24, 84) :
When you become attached to something, do not do so as to an
object that cannot be taken away from you, but as if it were something
like a pot or a glass cup, so that, if it is broken, when you
remember what it was, you will not be disturbed ... Remember
that what you love is mortal, and that nothing of what you love
belongs to you in the proper sense of the term. It has been given to
you for the time being, not forever or in such a way that it cannot
be taken away from you, but, like a fig or a bunch of grapes, at a
particular season of the year. If you get a craving for them during
the winter, then you're stupid.
Marcus Aurelius then returns to the importance of concentrating upon
the present moment. This indissoluble link between the delimitation of
the self and the delimitation of the present moment is extremely significant.
It is only when I am active, either within myself or upon the
outside world, that I am truly myself and at liberty; and it is only in the
present moment that I can be active. Only the present is mine, and the
present is all that I live.
When the self has thus isolated and returned into itself, says Marcus, it
can be compared to the Sphairos of Empedocles. For Empedocles, this
term denoted that unified state of the universe when it is dominated by
Love, as opposed to the state of division it is in when dominated by Hate.
While in its state of unity, the universe is perfectly round, delighting in its
joyful immobility. In the philosophical tradition, Empedocles' Sphairos
had become the symbol of the sage, "completely within itself, wellrounded
and spherical, so that nothing extraneous can adhere to it,
because of its smooth and polished surface," in the words of Horace.15
120 THE I N NER CITADEL
Such an image corresponds to the ideal of the inner citadel, invincible
and impenetrable (VIII, 48, 3), which represents the self that has delimited
itself.
At the end of this passage, Marcus alludes to our inner daimon, which,
for him, is identical with the self, the guiding principle, or the faculty of
reflection. I shall return below to this notion of the daimon.
As we can see, this delimitation of the self is, in the last analysis, the
fundamental exercise of Stoicism. It implies a complete transformation of
our self-consciousness, of our relation toward our body and toward
external goods, and of our attitude toward the past and the present. It
calls for concentration on the present moment, an asceticism of detachment,
the recognition of the universal causation of Destiny, in the midst
of which we are plunged, and the discovery of the power we possess to
judge freely, that is, to give things whatever value we wish to give them.
Thus, the process of the delimitation of the self brings about a distinction
between two elements. On the one hand, there is what we believe
to be our true self our body, but also our soul-the vital principletogether
with the emotions that it feels. On the other hand, there is our
power to choose. That which we think is our true self is imposed upon
us by Destiny, but in fact our genuine self is situated high above Destiny.
This opposition between our two "selves" appears quite clearly in a
passage where Marcus Aurelius confesses that he is slow-minded. This
trait, he writes, is inborn in him; it belongs to his character and his
physical constitution, and therefore does not depend upon him, any
more than do his size or the color of his eyes. What does depend on him,
by contrast, is his freedom to act in a moral way (V, 5):
So it's not likely that they're going to admire your quick-wittedness.
So be it! But there are many other matters about which you
cannot say that you are not gifted; these are the things that you must
display, because they are completely within your control: avoiding
duplicity; being serious; putting up with suffering; having contempt
for pleasure; not complaining about Destiny; having few needs;
being free, benevolent, and simple; avoiding idle chatter; possessing
greatness of soul. Can't you feel how many things there are which
you are capable of displaying, and for which the absence of talent
and natural capacities can no longer serve you as an excuse?
Two things are opposed in this passage: the awareness by means of
which one discovers one's psychological self, with its qualities and its
defects, and such as it is determined by Destiny. Over and against this, we
The Discipline of Assent 121
see the awareness of one's self qua guiding principle, and therefore capable
of acceding to the sphere of morality. We thus have to do with two
aspects of the faculty of reasoning and thinking. Although reason is
inherent in every human being, it is only equally present in all human
beings in its role as a faculty of judgment and of moral decision-making.
This, however, does not prevent the existence of qualitative differences
in speculation and in expression, according to one's individual particularities.

Let us be clear: the self, whether envisaged as a principle of freedom
capable of acceding to morality, or as a guiding principle, is not, by itself,
either good or evil. It is indifferent. To be able to choose means being
able to choose between good and evil; consequently, it means being able
to be either good or evil. For Marcus, rationality is not good in and of
itself, as it was for Plato. Reason can be utterly depraved (X, 13):
Men commit [these evil actions] not with their hands or feet, but
with the noblest part of themselves. If it so wishes, however, this
same part may become faith, modesty, truth, law, or a good daimon.
This delimitation of the self, as a potential for liberty which transcends
Destiny, is equivalent to the delimitation of the faculty I possess to judge,
and either to give or to withhold my assent from my value-judgments. I
may be constrained by Destiny to have a body; to be sick or poor; to be
hungry; or to die on such-and-such a day; but I can think whatever I
please about such situations. I can refuse to consider them as misfortunes,
and no one can tear this freedom of viewpoint away from me.
In the name of what, however, or in virtue of what shall I judge that
the only good is moral good, and the only evil moral evil? This is where
the mystery of freedom comes in. As Marcus says, the self, in its capacity
as the power of judging and choosing, can also become "faith, modesty,
truth, law, or a good daimon, " as well as the contrary of any of these.
Thus the self, if it so desires, can identify itself with universal Reason, or
the transcendent Norm which posits the absolute value of morality. This
is precisely the level at which Marcus was situating himself when he
wrote his spiritual exercises; in other words, he was identifying himself
with this universal Reason or transcendent Norm. This is what Epictetus
used to call "the Other" (I, 30, l ) :
When you go to see some important personage, remember that
there is an Other, watching what happens from above, and that it is
better to please this Other than that man.
122 THE INNER CITA D EL
Like an inner voice, this Other has a dialogue with the guiding principle
in the discussion which Epictetus imagines following this passage. It is,
moreover, this same transcendent Other with whom Marcus Aurelius
carries on a dialogue in the Meditations.
It can thus be said-although Marcus does not make the distinction
explicitly-that there is a difference between two kinds of freedom. On
the one hand, there is freedom of choice, by virtue of which the guiding
principle has the possibility of rendering itself either good or evil. On the
other, there is real freedom, thanks to which the guiding principle chooses
moral good and universal Reason, and thereby ensures that its judgments
are true, its desires fulfilled, and its acts of will efficacious. Only real
freedom is freedom in the full sense of the term.
Thus, the guiding principle is an "inner citadel," already impregnable
in its guise as freedom of choice, which cannot be forced if it refuses.
This citadel is still more impregnable, however, in its guise as real freedom-that
is, if it manages, thanks to its identification with universal
Reason, to liberate itself from all that could possibly subjugate its judgments,
desires, and its will (VIII, 48) :
Remember that the guiding principle becomes invincible when it
turns itself toward itself, and is content with not doing that which it
does not wish to do, even if its resistance is unreasonable .
What shall happen, then, if it surrounds itself with circumspection
and reason when it emits a judgment? This is why the intellect,
when freed from the passions, is a citadel; for mankind has no
stronger fortress than this. If we take refuge within it, we will be in
an impregnable position from now on.
When the guiding principle thus discovers that it is free in its judgments,
that it can give whatever value it pleases to the events which
happen to it, and that nothing can force it to commit moral evil, then it
experiences a feeling of absolute security. From now on, it feels, nothing
can invade it or disturb it. It is like a cliff against which the crashing surf
breaks constantly, while it remains standing unmoveably as the waves
come, bubbling, to die at its feet (IV, 49, l).
In the passage from Marcus which I have discussed at length above,
one can observe a complete equivalence between five terms:
r. the self;
2. intellect (nous);
The Discipline of Assent 1 23
3. the power of reflection ( dianoia);
4. the guiding principle (hegemonikon); and
5. the inner daimon.
All this is in complete conformity with Stoic tradition, including the idea
of the daimon, which seems clearly to turn up in the writings of Chrysippus.16
The definition of the happy life, according to Chrysippus, is that in
which everything is done "in accordance with the harmony between the
daimon within each one of us and the will of the governor of the universe."

It is not difficult for modern readers to understand this identification of
the self with the intellect, the power of reflection, or the guiding principle;
but the idea of the daimon may seem more obscure. It is a very old
notion: in the Homeric poems, daimon often evokes the idea of individual
destiny, or more generally, a diffuse divine power. Everyone is familiar
with Socrates' daimon, which Plato presents as an inner voice; but we
ought not to forget that Plato himself, when he speaks near the end of
the Timaeus (9oa) of the rational soul "which is the sovereign soul within
us," asserts that "the god has given it to each one of us as a present, as ifit
were a daimon. " A few lines later (9oc) , Plato adds that whoever has
succeeded in touching true reality "renders ceaseless worship to the
divinity, and keeps the daimon which lives within him in good state. " For
Aristotle, the intellect within us is something divine.17
Might not this daimon within us be a power which transcends the self,
and which cannot therefore be identified with the self? And yet, even
though for Plato we are the rational soul, he nevertheless tells us that we
must keep this daimon "in good state." This is probably a reference to the
statue of a god, to which worship must be offered.
We find the same ambiguity in Marcus Aurelius. Sometimes he tells us
that we must conserve this inner divinity and preserve it from all contamination,
as if it could be stained (II, 13, l; II, 1 7, 4; III, 12, l; III, 16,
3). Elsewhere, however, Marcus asserts that we must carry out the will of
the daimon which God has given to us, as though we had to do with a
reality which transcends us (III, 5, 2; V, 27) .
In fact, however, such assertions do not mean that Marcus thinks of
the daimon as something different from the intellect or the power of
reflection. For instance, he says of the power ofreflection (III, 7, 4)-just
as he says of the daimon-that we must take care all our lives " to preserve
it from a deformation which would not be fitting for a being which
thinks and lives in community with other human beings."
1 24 THE I N NER CITA D EL
Everything becomes clear if we replace the word daimon by "reason."
On the one hand, reason for the Stoics is a part of universal divine
Reason; it was given to us by the latter, and we must do what reason
wishes. On the other hand, however, our reason may become corrupted,
and we must therefore take care to preserve it against every attack. This
celestial gift is a fragile one.
What, however, is the precise relationship between this daimon and the
self? To be sure, it corresponds to the transcendent Norm, which, as we
have seen, was equivalent to Reason. It also corresponds to the " Other"
mentioned by Epictetus: a kind of inner voice which imposes itself upon
us. Here, however, we come face to face with the paradox of moral life,
for the self identifies itself with a transcendent Reason which is simultaneously
above it and identical with it; it is a case of " Someone within me,
more myself than mysel£ "18 As Plotinus19 said of the Intellect, by virtue
of which we lead a spiritual life: " It is a part of ourselves, and we ascend
toward it."
Although the self may thus raise itself to a transcendent level, it is very
difficult for it to keep itself there. The figure of the daimon allows Marcus
Aurelius to express, in religious terms, the absolute value of moral intent
and the love of moral good. No value is superior to virtue and the inner
daimon (III, 6, r-2) , and everything else, compared to the mysteries
which honor the eminent dignity of the inner daimon, is worthless pettymindedness
(III, 6, 3).
There is something quite remarkable in this Stoic affirmation of the
transcendence of the realm of moral intent, compared to all other reality.
It could be compared to the distinction between the three orders which
we find in Pascal: the order of the "flesh"; that of the "spirit"; and that of
the "will. "20 Above all, it can be compared to Pascal's distinction between
the triad of "bodies," "spirits," and "charity." Each order transcends
the others to an infinite degree:21
One little thought could not be made to arise from all bodies taken
together, for this is impossible and they are of different orders. One
single movement of true charity could not be derived from all
bodies and all spirits; for that is impossible. It is of another order,
and is supernatural.
In Pascal, this idea is intended to allow us to understand that Jes us Christ
has neither the splendor of physical grandeur, nor that of intellectual
genius. There is nothing more simple than He, and yet more hidden. His
The Discipline of Assent 125
grandeur is of another order. Similarly, for the Stoics, the order of good
will and moral intent infinitely transcends the order of thought and of
theoretical discourse, as well as that of physical magnitude. What makes
humankind equal to God is reason, when it chooses moral good.
"Everything is a matter of judgment"
The discipline of assent, then, orders us to consent only to comprehensive
representations, and it represents logic as the latter is lived and put
into practice. It might therefore appear that this discipline is exercised
only in a limited and determinate area-the rectitude of our inner discourse-and
that it does not interfere with the other areas of exercise,
namely those of desire and of action.
In fact, however, this is by no means the case. In the first place, the
discipline of assent is not exercised only with regard to inner discourse,
but also with regard to outer discourse. In other words, part ofit consists
in not lying, either to oneself or to others. It is for this reason that Marcus
calls the virtue which corresponds to this discipline "truth" (IX, I, 2) .
Above all, however, as we have seen throughout this chapter, there is a
sense in which the discipline of assent embraces all the other disciplines,
which can only be practiced through the perpetual rectification of our
inner discourse-that is, what we say to ourselves about things. On the
one hand, the discipline of assent is the same thing as the criticism of our
value-judgments, and to practice it presupposes that we accept a fundamental
Stoic principle of action: that the only good is moral good, and
the only evil is moral evil. On the other hand, practicing the disciplines
of desire and of action consists essentially in rectifying the judgments
which we bring to bear upon things. Leaving aside doctrinal refinements
and quarrels within the school, we can say that for the Stoics in general,
desire and impulses to action are essentially acts of assent.22 It is no doubt
true that their notion implies that of "movement-toward," but this
movement is inseparable from our inner adherence to a specific judgment
or discourse which is uttered about things.
Thus, we can say that, for Marcus, " everything is a matter of valuejudgments."
This does not imply any kind of subjectivism or skepticism,
but is the simple application of what we could call Stoic "intellectualism."
Inherited from Socratism, this doctrine proclaims that all virtue is a
kind ofknowledge,23 and that all vice is ignorance. Whatever the precise
meaning of this Socratic doctrine may have been, it is clear that it is not a
question of theoretical or abstract knowledge and ignorance, but of a
126 THE I N NER CITADEL
knowledge and a non-knowing which engage the individual. The kind
of knowledge at issue does not have to do with judgments of existence,
but with value-judgments, which bring into question one's entire way of
living. This nuance is conveyed well by the term "realize." A person
who commits a fault does not " realize " that his action is bad. He thinks it
is good, by means of a false value-judgment. A good man, by contrast,
"realizes" that moral good is the only good, which is the same as to say
that he understands the kind of life to which his value-judgment commits
him. There is implied within this doctrine the idea that every person
has a natural desire for the good, and that he can only fail to achieve it by
being mistaken about the nature of the good. As Rene Schaerer24 has
correctly observed, this is the postulate upon which Socratic and Platonic
dialectics are based: " No discussion is possible if one's adversary refuses to
admit that good-in one form or another-is better than evil."
It is from the viewpoint of this "intellectualism" that we can say that
"no one is evil voluntarily"; for the apparently evil person, although he
naturally desires the good, is simply mistaken by the value-judgment he
brings to bear upon the nature of the good. As Epictetus and Marcus
Aurelius both say, following Plato: " each soul is deprived of the truth
involuntarily."
Epictetus elsewhere gives forceful expression to this doctrine (II, 26) :
All errors imply a contradiction, for since he who errs does not wish
to err, but to succeed, it is obvious that he is not doing what he
wishes. What does the thief want to do? That which is profitable to
him. If therefore, theft is a harmful thing for him, then he is not
doing what he wishes. Now contradiction is, for every rational soul,
naturally abhorrent. So long as the soul is not aware that it is involved
in a contradiction, nothing prevents it from doing contradictory
things. Once it has become aware, however, it is absolutely
necessary that it desist from contradiction and flee, just as in the case
of error. He who notices his error is obliged by harsh necessity to
renounce it; but as long as the error does not appear, he adheres to it
as if it were the truth. He who is able to show each person the
contradiction which is the cause of his error, and to make clear to
him in what sense he is not doing what he wants, and is doing what
he does not want, is therefore a skilled talker, and knows how to
refute and persuade at the same time. Indeed, if a person can be
shown this, then he will retreat of his own accord. As long as you
do not show this, however, do not be surprised if he persists in his
The Discipline of Assent 127
error, for he does what he does because he believes it is a good
action. Socrates was full of confidence in his ability to do this, and
that is why he used to say: "I don't usually quote authorities to back
up what I say, but am always satisfied with my interlocutor. It is he
whose vote I take, and him I call forth as a witness, and he alone
replaces all the others for me." For he knew that once the rational
soul is set in motion, like a scale, it is going to tip whether people
want it to or not. Point out a contradiction to the guiding principle,
and it will give it up. If you do not, then it is yourself you should
accuse, rather than the person you cannot persuade.
"Everything is a matter of value-judgment," says Marcus (II, I 5; XII,
26, 2) , whether the subject is the discipline of assent, the discipline of
desire, or that of action. Can the last two, then, be reduced to the first?
The descriptions given by Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus incline us to
think that they apply to different domains, in accordance with the various
relationships with reality into which we enter. My relationship to
universal Nature and the cosmos is the subject of the discipline of desire;
my relationship to human nature is that of the discipline of action; and
my relationship with myself-insofar as I am a power of assent-is the
domain of the discipline of assent. Nevertheless, it is the same method
which is used in the three disciplines. It is always a matter of examining
and criticizing the judgments which I bring to bear, either on the events
which happen to me, or on the actions which I want to undertake. From
this point of view, as Emile Brehier has said, "logic penetrates the whole
of our conduct. "25

THE DISC IPLINE OF DES I RE,
OR A MOR FATI
Discipline of desire and discipline of the impulses
The ancient Stoics distinguished two main functions of the guiding principle:
assent, which is concerned with the areas of representation and
knowledge, and active impulse (horme) or the will, which is concerned
with the area of the motor functions, or of the movement toward objects
which is caused by our representations. 1 After them, Epictetus and Marcus
Aurelius are the only Stoic thinkers who distinguish not two, but
three functions: assent, desire, and active impulse, to which the three
disciplines of assent, desire, and impulse correspond. It is interesting to
note that we find in Marcus Aurelius a systematic description of reality,
which justifies this opposition between desire and impulse in a way that
is much more precise than anything to be found in the sayings of
Epictetus as reported by Arrian.
Desire and active impulse represent a reduplication of the notion of
the will. Desire is, as it were, an ineffective will, whereas active impulse
or tendency is will which produces an action. Desire is related to affectivity,
while tendency is related to the motor functions. Desire is situated in
the area of what we feel-pleasure and pain-and of what we wish to
feel: it is the domain of passion, in the double sense of a state of the soul
and of passivity with regard to an external force which imposes itself
upon us. Tendency, by contrast, is situated in the domain of what we
want or do not want to do. It is the domain of action and initiative, and
implies the idea of a force within us which wants to exercise itself
For Marcus, desire and aversion presuppose passivity. They are provoked
by external events, which are themselves the product of a cause
which is external to us; the tendency to act or not to act, by contrast, is
the effect of that cause which is within us (IX, 3 r ) . For Marcus, these two
causes correspond respectively to common and universal Nature, on the one
hand, and to our nature, on the other (XII, 32, 3):
The Discipline of Desire 1 29
Don't imagine that anything is important except that you act as your
own nature leads you, and that you suffer as common Nature ordains.
Elsewhere, Marcus writes (y, 25) :
At this moment, I have what common Nature wants me to have in
this moment, and I'm doing what my own nature wants me to be
doing at this moment.
And again (yl, 5 8):
No one is going to stop you from living according to the reason of
your own nature, and nothing will happen to you contrary to the
reason of common Nature.
By opposing external and internal causes, common Nature and one's
own nature, Marcus provides an ontological foundation for the disciplines
of desire and of impulse. The farmer's object is my relationship
with the immense, inexorable, and imperturbable course of Nature, with
its ceaseless flux of events. At every instant, I encounter the event which
has been reserved for me by Destiny; that is, in the last analysis, the
unique, universal, and common Cause of all things. The discipline of
desire will therefore consist in refusing to desire anything other than
what is willed by the Nature of the All.
The object of the second discipline-that of active impulses and the
will-is the way in which my own minuscule causality inserts itself
within the causality of the world. In other words, this discipline consists
in wanting to do that which my own nature wants me to do.
We saw earlier that the discipline of assent constitutes, as it were, the
fundamental method of the other two disciplines, since both desire and
impulse depend on the assent which we either give to, or withhold from,
our representations.
If this is the case, and the discipline of assent is somehow implied by
the two others, then one can say that the practice of the philosophical life
can be summed up in the two disciplines of desire and the active will
(Marcus Aurelius, XI, 13, 4) :
What evil can there be for you, if you do that which, in this present
moment, is appropriate to your nature;
and if you accept that which, in this present moment, comes at the
moment which is opportune for the Nature ef the All?

What precisely is meant by these two natures? "My" nature is not my
particular individual character, but my nature as a human being and my
reason, which I have in common with all human beings. Thus, it corresponds
to that transcendent self which we have seen in the context of the
discipline of assent: that divine principle or daimon which is within us 0/,
IO, 6) :
Nothing will happen to me which is not in accordance with the
Nature of the Whole, and it is possible for me to do nothing which
is contrary to my god and my daimon.
"My" nature and the common Nature are not opposed, nor external
to each other, for " my" nature and "my" reason are nothing other than
an emanation from universal Reason and universal Nature, which are
immanent in all things. Thus, these two natures are identical (VII, 55, 1):
Keep looking straight ahead, in order to see where nature is leading
you; both the nature of the All, by means of the events which happen
to you, and your own nature, by means of that which you must do.
These ideas go back to the Old Stoa, and can be traced at least as far
back as Chrysippus.2 While defining the moral goal as life in conformity
with nature, Chrysippus specified that he understood by this term both
universal Nature and that nature which is peculiar to humankind. The
identity between "nature " (physis) and "reason" �ogos) is, moreover,
attested throughout the Stoic tradition.3 The fact that these two terms are
identical means that the world, together with all beings, is produced by a
process of growth (in a sense, this is the meaning of the word physis) ,
which has within itself its own method, rational law of cause and effect,
and organization (this is the meaning of the word logos) . Human beings,
as rational animals, live according to nature when they live according to
that inner law which is reason.
We constantly return to the fundamental intuition of Stoicism: selfcoherence,
which is at the same time the law which generates reality and
that which regulates human thought and conduct. The two disciplines of
desire and impulse thus consist, in the last analysis, in remaining coherent
with oneself; and this is the same thing as remaining coherent with the
Whole of which we are only a part (IV, 29, 2) :
He who flees the reason of the human community is a fugitive ....
He who separates and distances himself from the Reason of com-
The Discipline of Desire 13 I
man Nature, and complains about what happens to him, is an
abscess upon the world ... He who splits off his own particular soul
from the soul of other rational beings is like an amputated limb of
the city, for the soul is one.
By means of the discipline of desire, we are to desire only that which is
useful to the All constituted by the world, because that is what universal
Reason wants. By means of the disciplines of the will and of our impulses,
we must want only that which serves the Whole constituted by
the human city, because that is what is wanted by right reason, which is
common to all humankind.
Circumscribing the present
As the reader has perhaps already noticed, what characterizes the presentation
of the three exercise-themes in Marcus Aurelius, and differentiates
it considerably from the analogous expositions found in the sayings of
Epictetus as written down by Arrian, is the insistence with which Marcus
emphasizes that these exercises are concerned with the present. In the
case of the discipline of assent, they are concerned with our present
representations. In the discipline of desire, these exercises are directed
toward the present event; and in the discipline of active impulse what
counts are our present actions. We have already seen that the exercise
intended to delimit and circumscribe the self was, simultaneously and
indissolubly, an effort to concentrate upon the present.
This process of delimiting the present is entirely analogous to the
process by means of which we hold fast to the facts and to reality in our
objective and adequate representations, and refuse to add value-judgments
to them. There is, after all, a sense in which the value-judgments
which trouble us are always related either to the past or to the future. We
become agitated about the consequences which a present event-or
even something that happened long ago-may have for us in the future;
or else we are afraid of some future event. In any case, instead of sticking
exclusively to what is happening right here and now, our representations
constantly overflow toward the past and the future-in other words,
toward something which does not depend on us, and is therefore indifferent
(VI, 32, 2) :
Everything other than its own activity is indifferent to the faculty of
reflection (dianoia). Everything that is its own activity, however, is
within its power. Moreover, even among these latter activities, the
IJ2 THE I N NER CITADEL
reflective faculty concerns itself only about the present; for even its
past or future activities are now indifferent to it.
Only the present is within our power, simply because the only thing
that we live is the present moment (II, 1 4; III, ro, r; XII, 26, 2) . Becoming
aware of the present means becoming aware of our freedom.
For the present is real and has value only if we become aware of it; that
is to say, if we delimit it by distinguishing the present action or event
from the past and from the future. We must therefore recognize that our
real lives are limited to a minuscule point which, by the intermediary of
the present event or action, places us in constant contact-whether actively
or passively-with the overall movement of the universe. "To
circumscribe that which is lived in the present" means simultaneously to
isolate oneself with regard to the past and to the future, and to recognize
our pumness.
The delimitation of the present has two principal aspects. On the one
hand, its goal is to make difficulties and hardships bearable, by reducing
them to a succession of brief instants. On the other, it is a matter of
increasing the attention we bring to bear upon our actions, as well as the
consent which we grant to the events that happen to us. These two
aspects can, moreover, be reduced to one fundamental attitude, which
consists, as we can already glimpse, in transforming our way of seeing
things, and our relationship to time.
The first of these aspects appears very clearly in the following passage
(VIII, 3 6):
Don't trouble yourself by representing to yourself the totality oflife
in advance. Don't try to go over in your mind all the painful
hardships, in all their varying intensity and number, which might
possibly happen. Rather, when each of them occurs, ask yourself:
"What is there about this situation that is unbearable or intolerable?",
for you will be ashamed if you answer affirmatively. In
addition, remind yourself that it is not the present, nor the past,
which weighs upon you, but always the present; and this present
will seem smaller to you if you circumscribe it by defining and
isolating it, and if you make your reflective faculty ashamed at the
fact that it cannot put up with such a small, isolated little matter.
We always encounter the same method of the criticism of representations
and value-judgments, which consists in tearing away from
The Discipline of Desire 133
things their false appearance-which is what frightens us-and in defining
them adequately, without mixing in any representations which are
alien to the initial, objective representation we have of them. This is
what I have called the method of physical definition. For Marcus, it
consists not only in reducing a given reality to what it is, but also in
decomposing it into its parts, in order to discover that it is only an
assembly of its parts, and nothing else. No obj ect can make us lose our
mastery over ourselves, if we submit it to this method of division (XI, 2) :
A seductive melody ... you can despise it if you divide it into each
of its sounds, and if you ask yourself if you are lesser than each one
of them taken separately; if you are, you would be filled with
shame. The same thing will happen if you repeat this procedure in
the case of the dance, by decomposing it into each movement or
each figure .... In general, then, and with the exception of virtue
and its effects, remember to head as quickly as you can for the parts
of a process, in order, by dividing them, to get to the point where
you have contempt for them. Transpose this method, moreover, to
life in its entirety.
Either because of his reading of Marcus Aurelius, or as a result of a
personal experience, Anatole France wrote something similar:4
My mother used to say that when you went over them one by one,
there was nothing extraordinary about Mme. Gance's features.
Every time my mother expressed this opinion, however, my father
used to shake his head in disbelief No doubt, my worthy father was
doing the same thing I was: he wasn't going over Mme. Gance's
features one by one; and whatever they may have been like m
detail, their total effect was charming.
In any case, the reader will not have failed to notice Marcus' concluding
remark: "Transpose this method to life in its entirety." Here we
recognize the methods of definition and delimitation of the present
instant, which I have just discussed. We must not, says Marcus, lose our
self-control because of a song or a dance, since these things can ultimately
be resolved into a series of notes or movements which are nothing
but so many successive instants. Similarly, we must not let ourselves
become discouraged by the global representation of the whole of lifethat
is, of all the hardships and difficulties which await us. Like a song or
134 THE INNER CITA D EL
a dance, our lives are divisible into smaller units, and consist only of such
units. In order to execute a song or a dance step, we need to perform
each one of these units in succession. Life, too, consists only of a series of
such instants which we live in succession, and the better we are able to
isolate each one and define it precisely, the better we shall be able to gain
control over the entire series.
The other intention of the exercise of defining the present is to intensify
the attention we bring to bear upon what we are doing or experiencing.
Here, we are no longer concerned with diminishing hardships or
suffering; on the contrary, our goal is to exalt the consciousness of our
existence and our freedom. Marcus does not expand upon this theme,
but we can sense it in the insistence with which he returns to the
necessity of concentrating upon our present representations, our present
actions, and the present event, as well as the necessity of avoiding worry
about the past or the future (XII, r, r -2) :
All the happiness you are seeking by such long, roundabout ways:
you can have it all right now .... I mean, if you leave all of the past
behind you, if you abandon the future to providence, and if you
arrange the present in accordance with piety and justice.
It should be pointed out here that, for Marcus, "piety" represents that
discipline of desire which makes us consent "piously" to the divine will,
as the latter is made manifest in events. Likewise, "justice" corresponds
to the discipline of action, which makes us act in the service of the
human community.
Marcus repeats the same exhortation elsewhere (XII, 3, 4) :
If you apply yourself to living only that which you are living-in
other words, the present-then you can live the rest of your life
until your death in peace, benevolence, and serenity.
What is required is that we dedicate ourselves, completely and wholeheartedly,
to what we are in the process of doing at a given instant,
without worrying about either the past or the future (VI, 7) :
Take joy and repose in one thing only: to pass from one action
accomplished in the service of the community to another action
accomplished in the service of the community; all this accompanied
by the remembrance of God.
The Discipline of Desire 135
There is also a feeling of urgency about this attitude, for death can
arrive at any moment (II, 5, 2) :
Each oflife' s actions must be performed as if it were the last.
When we view things from the perspective of death, it is impossible to
let a single one of life's instants pass by lightly. If, like Marcus and the
Stoics, we believe that the only good thing is moral action and a perfectly
good and pure intent, then we must transform our way of thinking and
of acting in this very instant. The thought of death confers seriousness,
infinite value, and splendor to every present instant of life. " To perform
each oflife's actions as ifit were the last" means to live the present instant
with such intensity and such love that, in a sense, an entire lifetime is
contained and completed within it.
Most people are not alive, because they do not live in the present, but
are always outside of themselves, alienated, and dragged backwards and
forwards by the past and by the present. They do not know that the
present is the only point at which they are truly themselves and free. The
present is the only point which, thanks to our action and our consciousness,
gives us access to the totality of the world.
In order to fully comprehend Marcus' attitude toward the present, we
must recall the Stoic definition of the present, as it is given in a summary
of Stoic philosophy:5
Just as the entire void is infinite in every direction, so all of time is
infinite in both directions. Both the past and the future are infinite.
He [i.e. , Chrysippus] states very clearly that, in general, time is
never present, for since that which is continuous is divisible ad
infinitum, then in accordance with this division all of time is also
divisible ad infinitum. Therefore, there is no present time, in the
proper sense of the term; rather, it is spoken of in an extended sense
(kata platos). Chrysippus says that only the present " actually belongs"
(hyparchein) [to a subject] ; whereas the past and the future are
realized (hyphestanai), but " do not at all belong actually [to a subject],"
just as it is said that only those predicates which really occur
"actually belong." For instance, "walking" belongs to me actually
when I am walking, but does not belong to me actually when I am
lying or sitting down ...
Here we are faced with two diametrically opposed conceptions of the
present: the first considers the present as the limit between the past and
136 THE I N NER CITADEL
the future, within a time which is continuous, and hence infinitely
divisible. From this quasi-mathematical point of view, the present does
not exist. According to the second conception, the present is defined in
relation to the human consciousness which perceives it, as well as to the
unity of the intention and attention which I bring to bear upon it. It is,
on this analysis, that which I am currently doing, expressing, and feeling.
From this point of view, the present does have a certain duration or
"thickness" which admits of greater or lesser degrees (kata platos). In this
sense, the Stoic definition of the present is entirely analogous to that of
Henri Bergson, who in La Pensee et le mouvant drew a distinction between
the present as a mathematical instant, which is nothing but a pure
abstraction, and that present which has a certain thickness or duration,
which is more or less defined and delimited by my attention. 6
In attempting to understand the opposition introduced by Chrysippus
between, on the one hand, the present, and on the other the past and the
future, the reader will no doubt have been willing to grant that the
present is "that which currently belongs to me," but may have been
quite astonished to read that the past and the future "are realized. "
Without entering into Chrysippus' technical refinements, which already
seemed exaggerated to the writers of antiquity, one can say in response
that what is important in the passage discussed above is not so much the
opposition between the two Greek terms which Chrysippus chose to
use-hyparchein and hyphestanai, elsewhere hyphestekenai, both of which
mean "to exist," "to be real"-but rather their difference of tense. The
word hyparchein, when used with relation to the present, means "to be
real qua current process"; whereas the word hyphestanai, used with regard
to the past and the future, means "to be real qua something determined
and definitive." The former has an inchoative and durative force: it
denotes that which is happening right at this moment. The latter, by
contrast, has a definitive value. The reader may, moreover, be willing to
grant that the past has a definitive value. But the future?
Here we must recall that, for the Stoics, the future was just as much
determined as the past.7 For Destiny, there is neither future nor past, but
everything is determined and definite.8 Chrysippus chose the verb hyparchein
because it was a technical term of logic, which Aristotle frequently
used to designate the inherence of an accident or an attribute in a
subject; thus it is a word which denotes a relationship to a subject.
Walking is "present"-that is, it belongs to me currently-when I am
walking. The past and the future, by contrast, do not currently belong to
me. Even if I think about them, they are independent of my initiative
and do not depend on me. Therefore, the present has reality only in
The Discipline of Desire 13 7
relation to my consciousness, thought, initiative, and freedom. It is these
which give it a kind of thickness and duration, which in tum is linked to
a series of unities: of the meaning of the discourse which I utter, of my
moral intention, and of the intensity of my attention.
When Marcus speaks of the present, he is always talking about this
durative present, which has a kind of thickness. Clearly, it is within this
present that I situate the representation which I am having at this moment,
the desire I am feeling at this moment, and the action which, at
this moment, I am performing. It is also this "thick" present, however,
which I can lessen by circumscribing and delimiting it, in order to make
it more bearable. Such a "shrinkage " of the present does not imply, as
Goldschmidt thought, 9 that the lived present would then be reduced to a
mathematical, infinitely divisible instant. Goldschmidt thought he could
percieve two attitudes toward the present in Marcus: one which denounced
the unreality of the present instant, and another which bestowed
reality upon the present instant via the initiative of a moral agent.
On the contrary: we have seen how Marcus compared life to songs and
to dance. Songs and dance are made up of units-notes and movements-which
do have a certain thickness, however slight it may be.
Now, a succession of unreal entities can never be put together so as to
give rise to a dance, a song, or a life. Moreover, when Marcus speaks of
the present in terms of a point within infinity, we can tell from the
context that he is still talking about a lived present, which has a certain
thickness (VI, 36, r):
Asia and Europe are comers of the world. The sea is a drop of the
world. Athas is a lump of earth, and all present time is a point
within infinity. Everything is tiny and unstable, and everything
vanishes (in immensity) .
Here, Marcus is not affirming the unreality of Asia, of the sea, or of
Mount Athas, and hence not of the present, either. Rather, he is
affirming-in a very scientific way, so to speak-their relative smallness
within the immensity of the Whole, and not their nonexistence.10 Once
again, we are dealing with the method of "physical" definition.
Events, the present, and cosmic consciousness
According to Epictetus, the goal of the discipline of desire was that we
not be frustrated in our desires, nor fall into that which we had been
trying to avoid. In order to realize this goal, we had to desire only that
THE INNER CITA D EL
which depends upon us-that is, the moral good-and flee only from
that which depends on us: in this case, moral evil. That which does not
depend on us is the realm of the indifferent: we must not desire it, but we
must not flee from it either, for if we do we risk "falling into what we are
trying to avoid." Epictetus, we noted, linked this attitude to our consent
to Destiny.
Marcus Aurelius takes up this doctrine point for point, yet in his
writings its implications and its consequences appear more clearly and
explicitly. Above all, the discipline of desire in Marcus is related first and
foremost to the way in which we are to greet the events which result
from the overall movement of universal Nature, which are produced by
what Marcus calls the " exterior cause" (VIII, 7) :
Rational nature (that is, the nature peculiar to human beings) follows
the path which is appropriate to it . . . if it has desires and
aversions only for that which depends upon us, and if it greets with
joy all that common Nature allots to it.
What is thus allotted to human nature is nothing other than the events
which happen to it (III, 1 6, 3) :
The proper characteristic of the good man is to love and to greet
joyfully all those events which he encounters (ta sumbainonta), and
which are linked to him by Destiny.
We have already seen that, for the Stoics, what is present for me is that
which is currently happening to me: in other words, not merely my
current actions, but also the present event with which I am confronted.
Here again, as in the case of the present in general, it is my thought and
my attention which singles out from the flux of things that which has
meaning for me; at which point my inner discourse will declare that
such-and-such an event is happening to me. Moreover-whether I
know it or not-the overall movement of the universe, set in motion by
divine Reason, has brought it about that I have been destined, from all
eternity, to encounter such-and-such an event. This is why I have translated
the word sumbainon (etymologically "that which goes together
[with] ") , which Marcus customarily uses to denote that which happens,
by the phrase "the events which we encounter." To be still more precise,
one would have to translate this as "the event which adjusts itself to us,"
The Discipline ofDesire 139
but such an expression cannot always be used. This is, however, precisely
the meaning which Marcus gives to the word sumbainon (V, 8, 3):
We say that events are fitting to us (sumbainein), just as masons say
that the square stones they use in walls or in pyramids "fit each
other" (sumbainein), when they are well-adapted to each other in a
given combination.
The imagery of the construction of the edifice of the universe is
reinforced by that of weaving. The interweaving of the woof and the
warp was a traditional, archaic image, linked to the figure of the Moirai,
who, as early as Homer, spun the destiny of each human being. 11 The
three Parcai, named Lachesis, Clotho, and Atropos, appear-first in the
Orphic Derveni papyrus,12 and then in Plato13 and the Stoics-as the
mythical figures of the cosmic law which emanates from divine Reason.
The following is a testimony to the Stoic doctrine:14
The Moirai (or "Parts") are so named because of the process of
separation (diamerismos) which they carry out: Clotho ("the spinner")
, Lachesis ("she who distributes the lots") , and Atropos ("the
inflexible one "). Lachesis is so called because she distributes the lots
which individuals have received according to justice; Atropos [gets
her name] because the division of the parts is unchangeable in any
of its details, and is immutable since eternal time. Finally, Clotho is
so named because the distribution takes place in accordance with
Destiny, and that which occurs reaches its end in conformity with
what she has spun.
Another testimony gives voice to approximately the same representations:
15
The Moirai get their name from the fact that they distribute and
assign things to each one of us. . . . Chrysippus suggests that the
number of the Moirai corresponds to the three times in which all
things have their circular movement, and by means of which all
things achieve their completion. Lachesis is so called because she
attributes to each human being his or her destiny; Atropos is so
called because of the immutable and unchanging character of the
distribution; and Clotho is so called because of the fact that all things
THE I N NER CITADEL
are woven and linked together, and that they can travel only one
path, which is perfectly well-ordered.
The " events which I encounter," and which " adjust themselves to
me " have been woven together with me by Clotho, the figure of Destiny
or universal Reason (IV, 34):
Abandon yourself willingly to Clotho; let her weave you together
with whatever event she pleases.
Marcus Aurelius is fond of mentioning this interweaving:
This event which you are encountering . . . it happened to you; it
was coordinated with you; and was in relation to you, since it was
woven together with you, from as far back as the most ancient of
causes (V, 8, 12).
So something has happened to you? Good! Every event that you
encounter has been linked to you by Destiny, and has, since the
beginning, been woven together with you from the All (IV, 26) .
Whatever happens to you has been prepared for you in advance
from all eternity, and the interweaving of causes has, since forever,
woven together your substance and your encounter with this event
(X, 5) .
While this motif is strongly emphasized by Marcus, it is not absent
from Epictetus' sayings, as recorded by Arrian (I, 12, 25) :
Will you be angry and unhappy with what Zeus has ordained? He
defined and ordained these things together with the Moirai, who
were present at your birth and wove your destiny.
For the Stoics, events were predicates, as we saw in the case of "walking,"
which is present to me when "I am walking." If, then, an event
happens to me, this means that it has been produced by the universal
totality of the causes which constitute the cosmos. The relationship between
myself and such an event presupposes the entire universe, as well
as the will of universal Reason. We shall have to examine later whether
this will defines the event in all its details, or merely gives it an initial
The Discipline of Desire 141
impulse. For the moment, it is sufficient to note that whether I am ill, or
lose my child, or am the victim of an accident, it is the entire cosmos
which is implicated in the event.
This interconnection or interweaving-the mutual implication of all
things in all things-is one of Marcus' favorite themes. For him, as for
the Stoics in general, the cosmos is but a single living entity, endowed
with a unique consciousness and will (IV, 40) :
How all things cooperate to produce everything that is produced;
how everything is linked and wound up together
in order to form a "sacred connection" (IV, 40; VI, 38; VII, 9) .
Thus, each present moment, the event which I encounter within it,
and my encounter with this event, imply and potentially contain all the
movement of the universe. This notion is in agreement with the Stoic
conception of reality as total mixture, or the interpenetration of all things
within all things.16 Chrysippus used to speak of a drop of wine which first
becomes mixed with the entire sea, and thence is extended to the whole
world.17 Similar world-visions are not, moreover, out of date: Hubert
Reeves, for example, speaks of E. Mach's notion according to which
"the whole universe is mysteriously present in each place and at each
instant of the world. "18 I am not trying to claim that such representations
are based upon science; rather, they are based upon an original, fundamental,
existential experience, which can be expressed in poetic form, as
it is in these verses by Francis Thompson:
All things
Near and far
Are linked to each other
In a hidden way
By an immortal power
So that you cannot pick a flower
Without disturbing a star. 19
Here again, we encounter the fundamental intuition of the cohesion
and coherence of reality with itself, an intuition which led the Stoics to
perceive love of self and accord with oneself in each movement of a
living being as much as in the movement of the universe as a whole, or in
the perfection of the sage. This is what Marcus expresses in passages like
the following (X, 2 1 ) :
1 42 THE I N NER CITADEL
The Earth loves! She loves the rain! And the venerable Ether? It loves
too! The World, too, loves to produce that which must occur. And I
say to the World: I, too, love--along with you. Don't we say:
" such-and-such loves to happen"?
Everyday language, which could use the verb " to love " to signify "to
be accustomed to," is here congruent with mythology, which gives us to
understand, in its allegorical way, that it is characteristic of the All to love
itself What Marcus is alluding to here is the grandiose image of the hieros
gamos between the sky (or Ether) and the earth, such as it is described by
Euripides:
The Earth loves! She loves the rain, when the waterless field, sterile
with dryness, needs moisture. The venerable Sky, too, when filled
with rain, loves to fall upon the earth, by the power of Aphrodite.20
This myth allows us to glimpse that such self-love is not the solitary,
egoistic love of the Whole for itself, but rather the mutual love, within
the Whole, of the parts for each other, of the parts for the Whole, and of
the Whole for the parts. Between the parts and the Whole, there is a
"harmony" or " co-respiration," which puts them in accord with one
another. Everything that happens to the part is useful for the Whole, and
everything that is "prescribed" for each part is, almost in the medical
sense of the term, "prescribed" (V, 8) for the health of the Whole, and
consequently for all the other parts as well.
The discipline of desire therefore consists in replacing each event
within the perspective of the Whole, and this is why it corresponds to
the physical part of philosophy. To replace each event within the perspective
of the Whole means to understand two things simultaneously:
that I am encountering it, or that it is present to me, because it was
destined for me by the Whole, but also that the Whole is present within
it. Since such an event does not depend upon me, in itself it is indifferent,
and we might therefore expect the Stoic to greet it with indifference.
Indifference, however, does not mean coldness. On the contrary: since
such an event is the expression of the love which the Whole has for itself,
and since it is useful for and willed by the Whole, we too must want and
love it. In this way, my will shall identify itself with the divine Will
which has willed this event to happen. To be indifferent to indifferent
things-that is, to things which do not depend on me-in fact means to
make no difference between them: it means to love them equally, just as
Nature or the Whole produces them with equal love. It is the Whole
The Discipline of Desire 143
which, through and by me, loves itself, and it is up to me not to destroy
the cohesion of the Whole, by refusing to accept such-and-such an
event.
Marcus describes this feeling of loving consent to the will of the
Whole and identification with the divine will in terms of the need to
"find satisfaction" in the events which happen to us. He writes that we
must "greet them joyfully," " accept them with pleasure," "love " them
and "will" them. The Manual of Epictetus, as written by Arrian, expressed
this same attitude in striking terms which encapsulate the entire
discipline of desire (chap. 8) :
Do not seek for things to happen the way you want them to; rather,
wish that what happens happen the way it happens: then you will be
happy.
This entire attitude is admirably summed up in Marcus' prayer to the
World (IV, 23):
All that is in accord with you is in accord with me, 0 World!
Nothing which occurs at the right time for you comes too soon or
too late for me. All that your seasons produce, 0 Nature, is fruit for
me. It is from you that all things come; all things are within you,
and all things move toward you.
This brings us back to the theme of the present. A particular event is
not predestined for me and accorded with me only because it is harmonized
with the World; rather, it is so because it occurs in this particular
moment and no other. It occurs in accordance with the kairos ("right
moment"), which, as the Greeks had always known, is unique. Therefore,
that which is happening to me at this moment is happening at the
right moment, in accordance with the necessary, methodical, and harmonious
unfolding of all events, all of which occur at their proper time
and season.
To will the event that is happening at this moment, and in this present
instant, is to will the entire universe which has brought it about.
Amor fati
I have entitled this section "amor Jati. " Marcus Aurelius, who wrote in
Greek, obviously did not use these two Latin words; what is more, they
are not, as far as I know, used by any Latin writer in antiquity. The phrase
1 44 THE I N NER CITA D EL
is Nietzsche's, and my intention in alluding to the love of Destiny of
which Nietzsche speaks is to help us better to understand, by means of
analogies and contrasts, the spiritual attitude which, in Marcus, corresponds
to the discipline of desire. Nietzsche writes, for example:
My formula for what is great in mankind is amor Jati: not to wish for
anything other than that which is; whether behind, ahead, or for all
eternity. Not just to put up with the inevitable--much less to hide
it from oneself, for all idealism is lying to oneself in the face of the
necessary-but to love it. 21
Everything that is necessary, when seen from above and from the
perspective of the vast economy of the whole, is in itself equally
useful. We must not only put up with it, but love it .... Amor fati:
that is my innermost nature.22
"To wish for nothing other than that which is": Marcus Aurelius
could have said this, just as he could have concurred with the following:
The main question is not at all whether or not we are satisfied with
ourselves, but whether, more generally, there is anything at all with
which we are satisfied. Let us suppose we said Yes to one single
instant: we have thereby said Yes not only to ourselves, but to the
whole of existence. For nothing is sufficient unto itself-neither in
ourselves, nor among things-and if, just one single time, our soul
has vibrated and resonated with happiness, like a stretched cord,
then it has taken all of eternity to bring about that single event. And,
at that unique instant of our Yes, all eternity was accepted, saved,
justified, and affirmed. 23
For Marcus, as for Epictetus, there is no link between this loving
consent to the events which happen to us and the Stoic doctrine of the
Eternal Return. This doctrine asserted that the world repeats itself eternally,
for the rational Fire which spreads throughout the world is subject
to a perpetual alternation of diastoles and systoles, which, in their succession,
engender a series of periods all of which are unique, and during
which the same events repeat themselves in a completely identical manner.
For the Stoics, the ideas of Providence and Destiny, together with
the concepts of the complete interpenetration of all the parts of the
world, and of the loving accord between the Whole and all its parts,
The Discipline of Desire 1 45
were enough to justify that attitude ofloving acceptance in the face of all
that comes from Nature which constitutes the discipline of desire.
Nietzsche, by contrast, links the love of Destiny to the myth of the
Eternal Return. To love Destiny thus means to want that what I am
doing in this moment, as well as the way in which I live my life, should
be eternally, identically repeated. It means to live any given instant in
such a way that I want to relive again this instant I am now living,
eternally. This is where Nietzsche's amor fati takes on a highly idiosyncratic
meaning:
The highest state which a philosopher can attain: to have a
Dionysiac attitude toward existence. My formula for that is amor
fati ....
For this, we must conceive of the heretofore denied aspects of
existence not only as necessary, but as desirable: and not only desirable
with regard to the aspects which have been approved up until
now (as their complements, for example, or as their presuppositions)
, but in themselves, as the aspects of existence which are more
powerful, more fertile, and more true, in which its will expresses
itself most clearly. 24
As we shall see, Marcus did indeed consider the repulsive aspects of
existence as necessary complements or inevitable consequences of the
initial will of Nature. Nietzsche, however, goes much further: in fact, an
abyss appears between his views and those of Stoicism. Whereas the Stoic
"yes" means a rational consent to the world, the Dionysiac affirmation of
the world of which Nietzsche speaks is a "yes" given to irrationality, the
blind cruelty of life, and the will to power which is beyond good and
evil.
We have wandered far from Marcus; yet this detour has perhaps allowed
us to arrive at a better definition of that consent to Destiny which
is the essence of the discipline of desire.
As we have seen, the exercises of definition of the self and concentration
on the present, together with our consent to the will of Nature as it
is manifested in each event, raise our consciousness to a cosmic level. By
consenting to the present event which is happening to me, in which the
whole world is implied, I want that which universal Reason wants, and
identify myself with it in my feeling of participation and of belonging to
a Whole which transcends the limits of individuality. I feel a sensation of
THE I N NER CITA D EL
intimacy with the universe, and plunge myself into the immensity of the
cosmos. One thinks ofBlake's verses:25
To see the World in a Grain of Sand
And a Heaven in a Wild Flower
Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand
And Eternity in an hour.
Thus the self qua will or liberty coincides with the will of universal
Reason, or the logos which extends throughout all things. The self as
guiding principle coincides with the guiding principle of the universe.
If, then, the self's awareness is accompanied by a consent to events, it
does not become isolated, like some tiny island, in the universe. On the
contrary: it is opened up to the whole of cosmic becoming, to the extent
that the self elevates itself from its limited situation and partial, restricted
individual viewpoint, toward a universal perspective. Thus, my consciousness
is dilated until it coincides with the dimensions of cosmic
consciousness. In the presence of each event-no matter how banalmy
vision now coincides with that of universal Reason.
When Marcus writes (IX, 6) : "Your present inner disposition is
enough for you, as long as it finds its joy within the present conjuncture
of events," the expression "is enough for you" has two meanings. In the
first place, as we have seen, it means that we possess the whole of reality
within this present instant. As Seneca said, 26 at each present moment we
can say, with God, "Everything belongs to me." This, however, means
that if my moral intentions are good in this present moment, and I am
consequently happy, neither all the duration oflife nor all eternity could
bring me one iota more of happiness. In the words of Chrysippus:27 " If
one has wisdom for one instant, he will be no less happy than he who
possesses it for all eternity." Elsewhere, Seneca28 writes: "The measure of
the good is the same, although its duration may vary. Whether one draws
a large circle or a small one does not depend on its shape, but on the
surface which they enclose." A circle is a circle, whether it is large or
small. Similarly, moral good, when it is lived within the present moment,
is an absolute of infinite value, which neither duration nor any other
external factor can affect. Once again, I can and I must live the present
which I am living at this moment as if it were the last moment of my life;
for even if it is not followed by any other instant, I will be able, because
of the absolute value of moral intention and of the love of the good
which I have lived in this instant, to say in that very instant: I have
The Discipline of Desire 147
realized my life, and have gotten everything I could have expected out of
it.29 It is this that enables me to die. As Marcus says (XI, 1, 1):
The rational soul ... attains its proper end wherever it achieves the
limit of its life. It is not like the dance or the theater or other arts of
that kind, in which all the action is incomplete if they are interrupted.
On the contrary: the action of the rational soul, in each of
its parts, and at whatever point one considers it, carries out for itself
what it was planning fully and without fault, so that it can say, "I
have reached my fulfillment."
Whereas a dance or the reading of a poem reach their goal only when
they are finished, moral activity reaches its goal in the very instant when
it is accomplished. It is therefore entirely contained within the present
moment, which is to say, within the unity of the moral intention which,
in this very moment, animates my actions or my inner disposition. Once
again, we note that the present instant can thus immediately open up the
totality of being and of value. One thinks of the words of Wittgenstein:
" If we understand by " eternity" not an infinite temporal duration, but a
lack of temporality, then he who lives within the present lives eternally.
"30
Providence or atoms?
Marcus asks, rather enigmatically (IV, 3, 5):
Are you unhappy with the part of the All which has been allotted to
you? Then remember the disjunction: either providence or atoms.
In the first sentence, we recognize the problematic characteristic of the
discipline of desire: we must accept, and even love, that part of the All
which has been allotted to us. If, says Marcus, we are initially unhappy at
and irritated by events, then we must remember the disjunctive dilemma:
either providence or atoms. Marcus is here alluding to an argument, and
it is enough for him to cite its first proposition-either providence or
atoms-in order to remind his readers of the entire thing. This dilemma
reappears throughout the Meditations, often accompanied by the argument,
or by variations on the argument, which remains implicit in this
first quotation.
Before we try to understand its meaning, it is necessary to spend some
THE I N NER CITADEL
time clarifying this initial proposition, which opposes two factors: on the
one hand, providence-elsewhere identified with Nature, the gods, or
with Destiny-and on the other hand, atoms. These two opposing concepts
correspond respectively to the models of the universe set forth by
Stoic and by Epicurean physics. Marcus uses a variety of images to
describe these alternatives: there is either a well-ordered world or a
confused one; there is either union, order, and providence, or else a
formless mess, the blind linking up of atoms, and dispersion (IV, 27, l;
VI, IO, l; IX, 39, l ) .
Marcus thus opposes two models of the universe: that of Stoicism and
that of Epicureanism. His reason for doing so is to show that, on any
hypothesis, and even if one were to accept, in the field of physics, the
model most diametrically opposed to that of Stoicism, the Stoic moral
attitude is still the only possible one. If one accepts Stoic physical theory-that
is to say, the rationality of the universe-then the Stoic moral
attitude-that is, the discipline of desire, or rational consent to the events
brought about by universal Reason-does not raise any difficulties: one
must simply live in accordance with reason. If, however, one accepts the
Epicurean physical theory-a model where the universe is a dust of
atoms produced by chance and lacking unity-then the grandeur of
humankind consists in our introduction of reason into this chaos:
If the All is God, then all is well. But if it is ruled by chance, don't
you, too, be ruled by chance (IX, 28, 3).
Consider yourself fortunate if, in the midst of such a whirlwind,
you possess a guiding intelligence within yourself (XII, 14, 4) .
On either hypothesis, then, we must maintain our serenity and accept
events the way they are. It would be just as crazy to blame atoms as it
would be to blame the gods (VI, 24) .
This serenity must especially be maintained in the face of death.
Whether one accepts the Stoic or the Epicurean model, death is a physical
phenomenon (VI, 24) :
After their deaths, Alexander of Macedon and his mule-driver
wound up in the same state: either they were taken back up into the
rational forces which are the seeds of the universe, or else, in the
same way, they were dispersed among the atoms.
The Discipline of Desire 1 49
Our choice of a model of the universe thus changes nothing with
regard to the fundamental Stoic disposition of consent to events, which is
nothing other than the discipline of desire (X, 7, 4) . If we reject the
hypothesis of rational Nature, says Marcus, and choose to explain the
transformations of the parts of the universe by saying that "that's just the
way things are " (that is, that things occur by virtue of some kind of blind
spontaneity) , then it would be ridiculous to affirm, on the one hand, that
the parts of the All can thus spontaneously transform themselves, and yet,
at the same time, to be surprised and angry at these transformations, as if
they were something contrary to nature.
Such arguments are obviously not Marcus' inventions. When he first
speaks about them (IV, 3), he makes only a brief allusion to them, as ifhe
were speaking of a well-known school-doctrine ("Remember the disjunction
... ") , without bothering to set forth the entire chain of reasonmg.

There is nothing in Epictetus which coincides word-for-word with
Marcus' formulations; yet we do find an argument of the same kind as
that set forth by Marcus in Seneca. The latter says roughly: "Whichever
hypothesis we accept-whether God or chance-we must philosophize;
that is, we must either lovingly submit to the will of God, or proudly
submit to the will of chance. "31
Whatever modern historians may claim, the dilemma " either providence
or chance," when used by Seneca or by Marcus Aurelius, does not
signify either the renunciation of Stoic physical theories or an eclectic
attitude which refuses to decide between Epicureanism and Stoicism.32
In fact, we can see that Marcus has already made his choice between
Epicureanism and Stoicism, by the very way in which he describes the
Epicurean model with a variety of pejorative terms: " confused mixture "
or "formless mess," for example. More important, Marcus refutes the
" atoms" explicitly and repeatedly, notably in IV, 2T
Should we accept the hypothesis of an ordered world, or that of a
confused mixture? -Why, quite obviously, that of an ordered
world. 33 If not, it would be possible for there to be order in you, and
for disorder to reign over the All, even though all things are so
distinguished from one another, and so deployed compared to one
another, and so much in sympathy with one another.
A similar refutation occurs in Book XI, I 8, 2 of the Meditations, where,
in order to remind himself of his duty to love other human beings,
150 THE I N NER CITADEL
Marcus utilizes the Stoic principle which affirms the cohesion and accord
with itself of Nature, all of whose parts are related to one another.
Marcus arrives at this principle by rejecting the other branch of the
dilemma-that is, the Epicurean model:
Go back farther up from the following principle: if we reject the
atoms, then it is Nature which governs the All. If this is so, then the
inferior beings exist for the sake of the superior beings, and the latter
exist for each other.
One the one hand, then, Epicurean physics is impossible to uphold, in
the face of both inner and exterior experience. On the other hand,
Epicurean ethics, which could follow from Epicurean physics, is impossible
to defend from the viewpoint of inner moral demands. If all that
exists are atoms, disorder, and dispersion, then (IX, 39, 2) :
What are you worried about? All you have to do is say to your
guiding principle: "You are dead; you are destroyed. You've become
a wild beast; you defecate, you mingle with the flocks, and
you graze.
With caustic irony, Marcus thus implies that in a world without reason,
human beings become irrational beasts.
When, in other passages, Marcus seems to imply that the Stoic moral
attitude would be the same, whichever model of the universe one uses,
and whichever physics one accepts, he is trying to demonstrate that, on
all possible hypotheses, it is impossible not to be a Stoic. Aristotle affirmed
that even when we say that we must not do philosophy, we are
still doing philosophy.34 Similarly, the arguments of Seneca and Marcus
Aurelius run as follows: even if we agree with the Epicureans, and say
that there is no universal Reason, and that therefore Stoicism is false, in
the final analysis we must nevertheless live like Stoics; that is to say, in
accordance with reason. " If everything is random, don't you, too, act at
random" (IX, 28). This does not by any means signify the abandonment
of Stoic physics, which Marcus elsewhere fully accepts and recognizes as
the foundation of moral choice. What we have here is instead a kind of
thought-experiment, which consists not in hesitating between Epicureanism
and Stoicism, but rather in demonstrating the impossibility of not
being a Stoic. Even if Epicurean physics were true, we would still have to
renounce the Epicurean idea that pleasure is the only value. We would
The Discipline of Desire 151
still have to live like Stoics; which means recognizing the absolute value
of reason, and consequently the indifferent nature of those events which
are independent of our will. In any event, we will still have to practice
the discipline of desire, which, as we have seen, consists in making no
distinction between indifferent things, which do not depend upon us.
Again and again, we find ourselves returning to the same central
theme: the incommensurable value of moral good chosen by reason, and
of true freedom, which are values compared to which nothing else has
value. This affirmation of the virtually infinite value of autonomous
moral reason does not, however, prevent the Stoic-precisely because he
does attribute this value to reason-from concluding that it would be
highly implausible for us to possess reason, and yet for the All of which
we are only a part not to possess it. Either providence-in which we case
we must live like Stoics-or else atoms-in which case we still have to
live like Stoics. In the last analysis, however, the fact that we do live like
Stoics proves that there are no atoms, but rather universal Nature . We
must therefore always live like Stoics.
The disjunction I have just discussed, which was used to prove that,
whatever our hypotheses, we have to live as Stoics, was a traditional part
of a more vast and developed argument sketched by Seneca. 35 This argument
took into account all possible hypotheses on the ways in which
events may be brought about, in order to prove that, on all these hypotheses,
the Stoic philosopher's moral attitude remained unchanged.
The accompanying diagram presents these hypotheses schematically; in
this regard, the following passage from the Meditations is highly significant
(IX, 28, 2; numbers in parentheses refer to subdivisions of the
diagram) :
Either the universe's thought exercises its impulse upon each individual
(5) . If this is so, then accept this impulse with benevolence.
Alternatively, it gave its impulse once and for all (4) and everything
else occurs as a necessary consequence (J) . Why, then, should
you worry?
Finally, if the all is God (2) , then all is well. If it is random (1),
don't you, too, act at random.
As we can see, each of the hypotheses presented brings us back to the
fundamental attitude of the discipline of desire.
In the diagram, we note that the disjunction-a fundamental and
absolute opposition-is situated between the affirmation of chance
THE I N NER CITADEL
(= Epicureanism) , and the negation of chance (= Stoicism) , which implies
the affirmation of providence. All of the subdisjunctions, by contrast,
are compatible with the Stoic system. This schema, however,
which makes explicit the logical structure of Marcus' text, shows us that
the affirmation of providence contains a great many nuances, and that the
events which result from the action of providence can have widely
varying relationships with this providence. The initial opposition between
chance and non-chance, or chance and providence, is, as Marcus
himself affirms, a disjunction, which is to say that one of the alternatives
completely excludes the other. They are absolutely incompatible.
The remaining oppositions, however, are not true disjunctions, but
are what historians of logic call " subdisjunctions. "36 In this case, exclusion
is not absolute, but relative: this means that, according to Marcus, in
the same world, some things may be brought about by the direct action of
providence (= hypothesis 2) , while others may be produced in a way
which is merely indirect and derivative (= hypothesis 3). Alternatively,
we could say that, in the same world, some things may be brought about
either by a one-time general impulse on the part of providence (= hypothesis
4) , or by a specific impulse which relates to rational beings
(= hypothesis 5).
Things are produced
either by
chance (1)
disjunction
either by
providence (2)
[or not by chance]
subdisjunction subdisjunction
or by an impulse or by an actual or in some derivative
given once and and particular way, as the necessary
for all at the impulse exercised accompaniment of
beginning of the world,
hence in the past (4) ,
specifically providence's decision
upon rational (kat' epakolouthesin);
beings, and hence = neither by chance nor
in the present (5) , directly by providence (3).
The Discipline of Desire 153
The distinction between hypotheses 2 and 3 is of capital importance as
far as the discipline of desire is concerned (VI, 3 6, 2) :
Everything comes from above, either under the impulse of the
common guiding principle (2) , or else as a consequence (3) (kat'
epakolouthesin). Thus, the gaping jaws of a lion, poison, and everything
which is unpleasant, such as thorns or mud, are only the
accidental consequences (epigennemata) of these things from above,
which are venerable and beautiful. Therefore, do not represent to
yourself these things which happen as a consequence (3) as alien to
that which you venerate; rather, rise up in your thought to the
source of everything (2) .
All things and events, therefore, are the results of universal Reason,
but in two different ways: either directly, in accordance with the will of
universal Reason, or else indirectly, as consequences which have not
been willed by universal Reason.
This distinction goes back to Chrysippus37 himself
The same Chrysippus, in the fourth book of his On Providence, treats
and examines a question which he thinks worthy of being asked:
"Whether human illnesses come about in accordance with Nature."
In other words, did that very Nature of things, or providence,
which has produced the system of this world as well as the human
race, also produce the illnesses, sicknesses, infirmities, and bodily
suffering which people endure? He thinks that it was not Nature's
primary intention to arrange things so that people should be exposed
to illnesses, for such a goal has never been compatible with
Nature, the creatrix and mother of all good things. However, he
says, while Nature was engendering and bringing into the world a
large number of great, appropriate, and useful things, other inconvenient
things which were linked to these great things she was
accomplishing came to be added accessorily. Thus, he says that these
obstacles were not produced by Nature, but as a result of certain
necessary consequences which he calls kata parakolouthesin. For example,
the construction of the human body required that the head
be formed of very small and thin bones. Thus, an inconvenient
side-effect-the weakness of the head-came about as a result of
the interest of the principal task.
154 THE I N NER CITA D EL
This theory of accessory consequences plays a very important role in
Marcus' discipline of desire, since it is intended to justify our love for
things and events which may seem painful or repulsive to us. If universal
Reason has laid down the laws of Nature which ensure the health and
the conservation of the entire universe, then
I must therefore joyfully accept and love that which happens to me
as a consequence of them (kat' epakolouthesin) (VI, 44, 3).
That which could be called an accidental and blind consequence of
Nature's initial will is the fact that a given natural phenomenon-a
plague, for example, or an earthquake-should happen to strike me in
particular; it is also the fact that certain natural phenomena---such as
lions, thorns, or dirt---seem to me to be terrifying or repulsive. The
notion of " accidental consequence" is, then, intimately linked to subjectivity.
The reason I think that an accident cannot be the work of a
benevolent Providence is because it is happening to me, is present to me,
and is perceived by me, or because I represent to it to myself as repulsive or
terrifying. I may then rebel, criticize Reason and universal Nature, and
refuse to accept it. Consequently, the discipline of desire consists in
rectifying this false judgment, by discovering that the event in question is
indeed the result of the benevolence ofNature, although without having
been willed directly by her. This has two implications: on the one hand,
the initial will of Nature was not to harm me. In the words of Cicero,38
" If drought or hail do harm to a landowner, that is no business of
Jupiter's." In other words, "natural" phenomena do not pick and choose
among individuals.
Second, Nature's initial will was not to produce something catastrophic,
repulsive, dangerous, or ugly. Everything is natural, but it is an
accidental consequence of Nature's will that such natural phenomena as
lions, poison, and thorns may possibly represent a danger for human
beings, or at least appear to be a threat to them.
Here again, the discipline of desire is based upon a physical definition:
that which, setting aside all-too-human value-judgments, restricts itself
to the objective, adequate representation of its object. Such a definition
sees reality as if human beings were not a part of it.
Precisely because Stoic providence is rational, it is not omnipotent.
Chrysippus told us that providence was constrained, in its construction of
the human body, to give the bones of the head a dangerous thinness.
Stoic Nature, like its Aristotelian counterpart, acts like a good adminis-
The Discipline of Desire 155
trator or craftsman, who gets the best she can from the available materials.
This has less to do with any defect of matter than with the very nature
of Reason. Reason demands a determinate, and therefore finite, object.
The possibilities open to it are limited, and it must choose between quite
determinate contrary solutions, each of which have their drawbacks and
advantages. The result is not only a determinate universe which cannot
be other than the way it is-this is but another aspect of the doctrine of
Destiny-but also " such-and-such"39 a universe, which unfolds " suchand-such"
an evolution from beginning to end, and repeats itself eternally.

When universal Reason produces the world, it engraves certain laws
into the coming-into-being of things. It is a law, for instance, that the
elements are in constant transformation, and yet that the beings brought
about by the transformation of the elements tend to preserve themselves.
The result of these fundamental laws, however, can be phenomena
which, on a subjective level, seem to us to be repulsive, terrifying, or
dangerous. The law of the perpetual metamorphosis of the elements, for
example, has among its results death, dust, and mud; while the law of
self-preservation results in such defensive elements as a rose's thorns or a
lion's teeth. All these are incidental consequences of Nature's initial
decision.
The notion of necessary and incidental consequences is thus intimately
linked to the idea of a Providence which gives a one-time, originary
impulse (see hypothesis 4 above) . Everything then happens by way of a
necessary chain of events (kat' epakolouthesin), of which the effects that are
painful to humankind were not willed by the original impulse (hypothesis
3). The two notions of originary impulse and consequential linkage,
then, strictly imply each other.
At the origin of everything is a single, universal impulse, which is the
work of Nature/Reason. We must not, however, imagine this impulse as
a "fillip," to use Pascal's tenn40 when he said that the God of Descartes
does nothing more than snap his fingers in order to set the universe in
motion. We are not talking about an impulse imposed from outside by
some being different from the world, which then allows the world to roll
along like a billiard ball. On the contrary: the impulse Marcus speaks of is
imposed by a force which is within the world: the soul or mind of the
world. This must not be imagined in accordance with a model which is
mechanical, but rather according to an organic one; for the Stoics see the
development of the universe as like that of a living being, developing
from a seed. A seed has two aspects: on the one hand, it contains within
156 THE I N NER CITADEL
itself a force which exerts pressure or an impulse. On the other, it
contains programmed within itself all the stages of the living being's
development. Since this program proceeds methodically, it is " rational,"
and this is why the Stoics call the forces which bring forth living beings
"seminal reasons. "41 God, who is identical with Reason and Nature, is
the source of all beings; but he is himself a seminal reason containing
within himself all other seminal reasons.42 This is why Marcus Aurelius
(IX, I, I O) can speak of
... the ancient impulse of providence, by means of which, starting
from a particular beginning, it gave the impulse so that this arrangement
of the world might be brought about. Prior to this, it had
gathered together some productive reasons of things which are to
come, and determined the forces which would engender births,
transformations, and successions of such-and-such a kind.
We are to picture this originary impulse as the effect of a force which,
from within, sets in motion the process of the expansion and deployment
of the universe. More exactly, what Marcus has in mind is a movement
of relaxation and expansion, which somehow causes the original energy
to explode. Thus, this universe contains within itself its rational laws of
development and organization. In this evolutionary process, as in the
growth of a living being, everything contributes to the welfare of the
entire organism, and everything is brought about as a necessary consequence
(kat' epakolouthesin) of the initial impulse, and the rational program
which the latter sets in motion. As we have seen, however, it may
be that these necessary consequences appear as evils to any given part of
the Whole, and it may seem that they have been "willed" by this developmental
law.
This theory of the originary impulse thus corresponds to the idea of an
impersonal, immanent providence, within the development of the universe
as a whole. The fact that the world is rational does not mean that it
is the result of the deliberation, choice, or calculation of some craftsman
exterior to his work. Rather, it means that the world possesses its own
internal law.
This image of an impersonal providence (hypothesis 4 above) seems
utterly opposed to that of a particular providence taking care of the
human race, and of some specific human beings in particular (hypothesis
5) . We now find the physical model of an impersonal law of nature,
which runs the risk of crushing individuals, replaced by the images of
The Discipline of Desire 157
gods who care for human beings, who can be prayed to, who are susceptible
to pity, and who concern themselves with the smallest details oflife.
These two representations appear to be completely incompatible, and
one might think that Marcus brings up the idea of a providence susceptible
to pity in the same way as he brought up the dilemma "providence or
atoms": in order, that is, to show that we must maintain the same Stoic
attitude, no matter which hypothesis is true (XII, 1 4):
Either the necessity of Destiny and unbreakable order, or else providence
capable of pity, or else directionless chaos.
If it is inflexible necessity, why do you resist?
Is it providence susceptible to pity? Then make yourself worthy
of divine assistance.
Directionless chaos? Then consider yourself fortunate that, in
midst of such a whirlwind, you possess within yourself a guiding
intelligence.
The very idea of a providence capable of pity does not seem compatible
with the principles of Stoicism, insofar as it seems to imply that
universal Reason could deviate from its initial movement. Seneca emphasizes
this point: " If divine majesty had done something which it later
had to modify, it would be an affront and the admission of an error. "43
God himself cannot change the course of destiny, because it is the necessity
and the law which he has imposed upon himself. God is his own
necessity unto himself.
Nevertheless, the opposition between the unique initial impulse and
individual providence is not as radical as it appears at first glance. In order
to discover the true meaning of this opposition, we must simply take into
account religious attitudes, as well as the mythical language which accompanies
them.
It is certain that the theory of an individual providence is a response to
the need to personalize our relationship with the world and with Nature,
as well as to the need to sense God's presence, his goodness, and his
paternity. Such a need had been felt since the very beginnings of Stoicism;
the famous Hymn to Zeus by the Stoic Cleanthes is a striking
testimony to it, since it requests the god's spiritual assistance: "O Zeus,
giver of all good things ... save men from sorry ignorance. Chase it, 0
Father, far from our hearts ... "44 Generally speaking, the figure of Zeus
is intended to provide a face for the impersonal force of the logos, Nature,
or the first Cause. Such an identification is clearly apparent in Seneca:
158 THE I N NER CITADEL
" The Ancients did not believe that the Jupiter [= Zeus] we adore on the
Capitol and in the other temples sent bolts of lightning with his own
hand. "45 On the contrary: by "Jupiter," they meant the soul and mind of
the world.
All names are appropriate to him.
Do you want to call him Destiny? You won't be wrong, for it is
from him that all things are suspended; he is the cause of causes.
Do you want to call him Providence? You will speak rightly, for it
is by his counsel that the needs of the world are provided for, in
order that it may reach its appointed term without impediment, and
that it may unfold all its movements.
Nature? You will not be in error, for it is from him that all things
are born, and thanks to whose breath we live.
The World? You will not be wrong, for he is all that you see; he is
present in all of his parts and he conserves both himself and his
parts.46
The rest of this passage applies the theory of the unique initial impulse
to Zeus-Jupiter:
Lightning-bolts are not hurled by Jupiter, but all things have been
so disposed that even those things which are not done by him do
not happen without that Reason which belongs to Jupiter ... For
even if Jupiter does not now do these things himself, yet he has
caused these things to happen. 47
For the Stoics, the figures of the other gods correspond to the elements
which make up the world, and they represent the phases of the
general movement of the universe. Epictetus (III, r 3 , 4-8) mythically
depicts Zeus-that is to say, Reason or Nature-at the moment when
the universe, after a phase of expansion (diastole) followed by concentration
(systole) , is returned via a general conflagration to its seminal state: in
other words, the moment when Reason is alone with itself Will Zeus
cry out: " Oh unhappy me! I have neither Hera, nor Athena, nor
Apollo ... "? "No," says Epictetus: "Zeus then keeps company with
himself, and rests within himself ... he entertains himself with thoughts
worthy of himself "
All this corresponds, then, to a religious need: the need to personalize
that power, to the will of which the discipline of desire instructs us
The Discipline of Desire 159
complacently to consent. This is why Marcus Aurelius, like Epictetus,
often employs the expressions "follow the gods" or " obey the gods"48 to
describe this attitude of consent.
Marcus also feels the need to perceive the attention which the gods
pay to him. In the first book of his Meditations (I, 1 7), he thanks them and
enumerates all the benefits they have accorded to him. In particular, he
mentions the dreams they have sent to him about his health, or the
communications, support, and inspiration which he has received from
them in his philosophical life. We may say that this corresponds to what
Christian theology calls "present graces." Thus, not only do the gods
help humankind in the realization of their moral life, but they also take
the trouble to help them to obtain those indifferent things (such as
health, wealth, and glory) which human beings seek (IX, II, 2; 27, 3).
I have spoken of a religious need; but the problem is just as much
sociopolitical, since the daily life of people in antiquity was punctuated
by religious ceremonies. Moreover, prayers and sacrifices would have no
meaning if there were no current and individual providence (VI, 44, 4) :
If the gods do not deliberate about anything-to believe this would
be impious; or else let us make no .more sacrifices, prayers, oaths,
nor let us carry out any of the other rites which we practice, as if the
gods were present and lived with us ...
This religious need thus corresponds to the desire to have a relationship
with some personal being who can, as it were, enter into a dialogue
with humankind. Another response to this same aspiration is the conception
of the daimon, which is, moreover, traditionally nothing more than a
particular element of the more general theory of providence.49 In this
regard, the following words of Epictetus are significant (I, 14, 12):
God has placed next to each person, as a guardian, his own daimon,
and he has entrusted each person to its protection .... When you
close your doors ... remember never to say to yourselves that you
are alone ... for God is within you.
In fact, however, such conceptions of gods mixing with human beings
and of the inner daimon do not fundamentally alter Stoicism's rational
demands. What I mean by this is that the figures of the gods deliberating
over the fate of an individual, or the figure of the daimon, are nothing but
mythical, imaginative expressions, intended to render the Stoic concep-
1 60 THE I N NER CITADEL
tions of Reason and Destiny more alive and personal. We can observe
this process at work, for example, in the following passage from Marcus
Aurelius 0/, 27):
He lives with the gods who constantly shows them a soul which
greets that which has been allotted to it with joy; it does everything
that is willed by the daimi5n which Zeus has given each person as an
overseer and a guide, and which is a small parcel of Zeus. It is
nothing other than each person's intellect and reason.
Here, then, the daimi5n is straightforwardly identified with humankind's
inner reason or the proper nature of humankind, which is a part of
universal Nature and Reason.
Once we disengage the hypothesis of special and individual providence
from its mythical formulation, it can perfectly well be integrated
within the overall scheme of the Stoic theory of providence. The Stoics
not only thought that universal Reason had, by means of its initial impulse,
set in motion a law of the development of the universe which has
as its goal the good of the Whole; but they also admitted that this
fundamental law of the universe has as its primary goal the good of
rational beings (V, 1 6, 5) :
Inferior beings are made for the purposes of superior ones, and
superior beings are made for one another.
Providence, then, is exercised directly, especially upon reasonable beings,
and by way of consequence it is also exercised upon other beings (VII,
75) :
The Nature of the All gave the impulse in the past [ = hypothesis 4] ,
so that the creation of the world might come about. Now, however,
either everything that happens happens as a consequence (kat'
epakolouthesin) of that [= hypothesis 3], or else there is a tiny number
of things (oligista)-and these include the most important oneswhich
are the object of a particular act of will [= hypothesis 5] on
the part of the world's guiding principle.
This " tiny number of most important things" refers to rational beings.
There is thus a general providence for the entire universe, which corre-
The Discipline of Desire 161
sponds to the "initial impulse " which Marcus mentions here. There is
also a special providence for rational beings: it is a particular act of will,
which " exercises its impulse upon each individual," as Marcus had said
elsewhere (IX, 28, 2) . These two notions are not, however, mutually
exclusive, for the general law, which is immanent within the universe
and results from the initial impulse, wants rational life to be the end that
justifies the universe. Origen50 attributes this doctrine explicitly to the
Stoics:
Providence made all things primarily for the good of rational beings.
Rational beings, since they are the most important, play the part of
children who have been brought into the world. Non-rational and
inanimate beings play the part of the placenta which is produced at
the same time as the child. . . . Providence looks primarily to the
needs of rational beings, but non-rational beings also profit, by way
of accessory consequence, from what is made for human beings.
This text should not, however, be opposed to that in which Cicero
states that Jupiter does not care about the damage caused by hail in some
landowner's garden; for what counts from the Stoics' point of view is not
such morally indifferent things as harvests. For them, the only important
thing is humankind's moral elevation and its quest for wisdom. Divine
providence, creative and nurturing toward inferior creatures, becomes
the educator of human beings. Henri Bergson used to call the world "a
machine for making gods";51 but the Stoics would gladly have called it a
machine for making sages.
Indeed, sages seem to be the privileged objects of this individual providence.
Note, for example, the following passage from Epictetus (III, 26,
28) :
Could God become so disinterested in his masterpieces, his servants,
and his witnesses: those he places as examples before people without
any moral training?
There is also this text from Cicero:52
The immortal gods do not only cherish the human race, but also
particular men ... who could not have been what they were without
divine assistance.
1 62 THE INNER CITADEL
For Marcus Aurelius, the main interest of this theory of providence's
various modes of action is that it specifies the way in which we should
practice the discipline of desire. We can look at events from two different
and yet convergent viewpoints, according to whether we place ourselves
in the perspective of the initial impulse, or in that of individual providence.

On the one hand, from the perspective of universal Nature and general
providence, things which can seem repulsive, unpleasant, ugly, or
terrifying, such as the thorns of a rose, the jaws of ferocious beasts, mud,
or earthquakes, will seem to be physical phenomena which are completely
natural: they are not directly programmed by the initial impulse,
but are the accessory and necessary consequences thereof If these inevitable
consequences of the order of the world personally affect the unfortunate
vineyard-owner of whom Cicero speaks, and he considers this to
be a misfortune for him, then it does not follow that "Jupiter" has willed
him to consider this phenomenon as a misfortune. The vineyard-owner
is free to represent events to himself as he pleases; in fact, however, such
events are only the accessory consequence of physical laws which result
from the initial impulse. If Cicero's vineyard-owner is a Stoic, he will say
"Yes!" to this universal order. He will say "Yes!" to the world, and will
love everything that happens. He will consider that the loss of his property
is morally neither good nor bad, but pertains to the order of indifferent
things. Indifferent things do not concern Jupiter, and have no meaning
within a universal perspective. They correspond only to a subjective
and partial point of view.
Nevertheless, from the perspective of particular providence, the
events that happen to me are individually destined for me. Clotho-that
is, the course of the universe, which has issued from the original impulse-has
woven them together with me since the origin of the world
(IV, 34; V, 8, 12; IV, 26; X, 5). Everything that happens to me is destined
for me, in order to give me the opportunity to consent to what God
wants for me, in precisely this moment, and in precisely this form. I am
to accept "my" own particular destiny, which the entire universe has
reserved for me alone (V, 8) :
A phrase like "Asclepius ordered him to practice horseback-riding,
or cold baths, or walking barefoot" is analogous to this one: "The
Nature of the All ordered for him an illness, a deformity, a loss or
something else of the sort." For in the first phrase, " ordered" means
The Discipline of Desire 1 63
"he prescribed that for him, since it corresponded to the state of his
health." In the second phrase, the event which comes to each
person has been assigned to him because it corresponded to his
destiny .... Let us therefore accept these events, just as we accept
the "orders" of Asclepius.
On the one hand, says Marcus, this event has happened especially for
you; it was " ordered" for you, was related to you, and was woven
together with you by the most ancient of causes. On the other hand, that
which was " ordered" for you in this way was the condition for the
efficient working and the very existence of the universe. 53
These two outlooks are not mutually exclusive, since each event is at
the same time the result of the general law of the universe, taken by itself,
and of this same general law of the universe, when applied to the good of
rational creatures.
Depending on which perspective one adopts, however, the practice of
the discipline of desire can take on different tonalities. One may be more
impersonal, tending as it does to eliminate all subjectivity in the admiring
contemplation of the ineluctable laws of a majestic but indifferent Nature
(IX, l). The other may be more personal, since it gives the individual the
feeling of contributing to the general good of the All, as he fulfills the
task, role, and destiny for which Nature has chosen him (VI, 42) :
We are all contributing to the accomplishment of a single result.
Some of us know this and cooperate consciously, whereas others do
so unconsciously. I think it was Heraclitus who said that those who
sleep are the workers and collaborators of what happens in the
world. . .. He who governs the universe will, in any case, know
perfectly well how to use you; he will know how to make you a
collaborator.
Pessimism?
"His joyless, disillusioned Meditations are penetrated by a profound pessimism
... they are an authentic testimony to the solitude of an intellectual."
These extracts from the catalogue54 of an exposition dedicated to
Marcus Aurelius in 1 988 provide a good summary of the idea most
historians since Renan have had of our philosopher-emperor. It is true
THE INNER CITADEL
that there is no lack of seemingly pessimistic declarations throughout the
pages of his book (VIII, 24) :
Just as your bath appears to you-oil, sweat, filth, sticky water, and
all kinds of disgusting things-such is each part of life, and every
object.
Or again (IX, 3 6) :
The decomposition of matter which underlies each one of us:
water, dust, bones, stench.
Sometimes, this disgust seems to be accompanied by a feeling of boredom
which reaches the point of nausea (VI, 46) :
What you see in the amphitheater and similar places makes you
sick: it's always the same thing, and such uniformity makes the
spectacle tedious; you feel the same way about the totality of life.
From top to bottom, it is always the same thing, made up of the
same things. Where will it all end?
Nevertheless, we must not rush into thinking that Marcus is here
giving us his personal impressions, or the expression of some incurable
sadness. We know, in fact, that he is embroidering upon a canvas already
prepared for him. His meditations are exercises which he practices in
accordance with a quite determinate method, while following pre-existing
models. Our task, therefore, is to try to understand the true meaning
and range of such traditional formulas.
In the first place, in many of these declarations we can recognize the
method of physical definition which we have encountered earlier. We
recall that this method is intended to make us rely upon our objective
representations, thereby avoiding the false and conventional value-judgments
which people tend to emit about objects. This method, says Marcus
(III, I I, 2) , must be applied to all objects which present themselves to
us in life, so that we may "see everything that happens in life with
exactness and from the perspective of Nature " (X, 3I, 5). Such a method
of physical definition will strip things naked (VI, I3, 2; III, I I, I); it will
"make it clear how little value they have, and will strip from them that
appearance of which they are so proud" (VI, I 3, 3). When speaking of
The Discipline of Desire 1 65
the method which defines things by reducing them to their parts (XI, 2,
2) , Marcus gives the following advice:
Except for virtue and that which relates to virtue, remember to get
right down to the parts which you've divided, and get to the point
where, by means of this division, you despise them. Then, transpose
this method to the whole oflife.
Marcus' goal is thus to denounce false values, and to see things in their
naked, "physical" reality. Fancy foods are only cadavers; purple vestments
are only sheep's hair; sexual union is only two bellies rubbing
together (VI, 13, l). The war Marcus is waging, he says, is a hunt
analogous to that of the spider and the fly (X, IO, l) , while social and
political life are not worth much (V, 33, 2) :
Everything by which people set so much store in life is emptiness,
putrefaction, pettiness; little dogs nipping at one another; little children
who laugh as they fight, and then suddenly burst into tears.
The same method is to be applied to people who think themselves
important (IX, 9) :
Imagine them as they are when they are eating, when they are
sleeping, when they are making love, or going to the bathroom.
Then imagine them when they are putting on airs; when they make
those haughty gestures, or when they get angry and upbraid people
with such a superior air.
We must always look to the "physical" reality; this also holds true for
fame, and the name which one leaves to posterity (V, 33):
It is nothing but a simple sound, as weak as an echo.
Likewise, by the method of dividing a whole into its parts, we may strip
life of its false appearances and reduce it to one of its moments:
Just as your bath appears to you-oil, sweat, filth, sticky water, and
all kinds of disgusting things--such is each part of life, and every
object (VIII, 24) .
166 THE I N NER CITADEL
Always consider human affairs as ephemeral and without any value:
yesterday, you were a bit of phlegm; tomorrow, you will be ashes or
a mummy (IV, 48, 3).
In the midst of a series of "physical" definitions, Marcus' definition of
death reveals once more the lack of value of our physical existence (IX,
36):
The decomposition of the matter which forms the foundation of
the being of each one of us: water, dust, bones, stench. Or consider
marble: it is only a concretion of the earth. Gold and silver? They
are the dregs of the earth. Clothing? Mere animal hair. The purple?
Just some blood; and so forth ...
Here we can catch Marcus as he trains himself to give physical definitions
of the most diverse objects, and we can legitimately suppose that
the definition of the decomposition of matter is no more charged with
emotional and personal power than are those of marble or of gold.
Instead, we are dealing with a (slightly artificial) method for finding
striking formulas. The goal of the whole exercise, however, is to denounce
false values, and this is the task of the discipline of desires.
Some historians55 have thought they could discern in these passages a
genuine attitude of repulsion on Marcus' part toward matter and physical
objects. According to them, Marcus thereby abandoned the Stoic doctrine
of Reason's immanence in matter, and the admiration which
Chrysippus had felt for the sensible world can no longer be found in
Marcus. This seems to me quite incorrect.
In the first place, when Marcus speaks about the " decomposition of
matter," he does not mean that matter itself is putrefaction, but that the
transformation of matter-which corresponds to death-is a natural
process necessarily accompanied by phenomena of decomposition
which, though they may appear to us to be repulsive, should nevertheless
be exactly and physically defined.
Marcus does not by any means abandon the Stoic doctrine of the
immanence of Reason in matter. He speaks of the Reason which governs
substance (ousia)-that is to say passive matter-as well as of that
Reason which spreads throughout all substance (VI, 1 ) , and molds all
beings with the help of substance (VII, 23) . He also speaks of the constructive
force within natural creatures (VI, 40) , which is to be revered.
To be sure, Marcus also speaks of the "weakness of matter" (XII, 7) , but
The Discipline of Desire
this "weakness" is nothing other than its "fluid" nature--that is, its
constant susceptibility to passive change and inability to act by itself,
which characterize Stoic matter.
It is also true that Marcus sometimes speaks of the body in terms of a
corpse (IX, 24; X, 3 3, 6) ; but he himself tells us that he has learned this
from Epictetus (IV, 27) :
"You are nothing but a little soul carrying a cadaver," as Epictetus
said.
A glance at the Discourses as collected by Arrian does indeed reveal that
Epictetus used this expression several times (II, 19, 27; III, ro, 15; 22, 41);
especially when he wonders if his corpse is his "self" (IV, 7, 3 1). Elsewhere,
Epictetus sometimes adds, as does Marcus, that the body is made
only of earth (III, 22, 41). These expressions, then, which could be
classified as pejorative, are not Marcus' original invention.
Finally, when Marcus compares life to bath-water, together with the
oily dirt which it contains, he is doing nothing other than practicing the
method of physical definition of which I have spoken. If we want to see
things for what they are, we must also learn to see as they are the realities
which are indissolubly linked to everyday life, such as the physical and
physiological aspects of our bodily functions. We must also become
accustomed to the constant transformation of things within and around
us, including dust, filth, bad odors, and stenches. Such a realistic view
will enable us to face life as it really is. One is reminded of the words of
Seneca:
It is no less ridiculous to be shocked by these things than it is to
complain because you get splashed in the baths, or get shoved
around in a public place, or that you get dirty in muddy places.
What happens in life is exactly like what happens in the baths, in a
crowd, or on a muddy road ... Life is not made for delicate souls. 56
Such a pitiless vision will strip life's objects of all the false values in
which our judgments wrap them up. The true reason for this alleged
pessimism is, then, that Marcus considers everything vile and petty in
comparison to that unique Value constituted by the purity of our moral
intention and the splendor of virtue. From this perspective, life is a
"stain" (VII, 47) . At the same time, however, such a way of looking at
life invites us to reflect on the relative and subjective character of our
168 THE I N NER CITADEL
ideas of "stain" and of "repulsive things." What is really repulsive is not
certain aspects of matter, but the passions and the vices.
In fact, the reason we consider certain aspects of physical reality "repulsive
" is that we are the victims of a prejudice, and we therefore do not
know how to resituate such aspects within the vast perspective of universal
Nature. All these aspects are, in fact, the necessary but accessory
consequences of the original impulse which Nature once gave to the
origin of things (VI, 36, 3):
The gaping jaws of a lion, poison, and everything unpleasantmud,
thorns, and so forth-are accessory consequences of these
sacred and venerable things on high. Don't imagine, then, that these
things are foreign to the principle which you venerate, but rather
rise up by your rational power to the source of all things.
Mud, dust, and dirty bath-water-all phenomena which we judge to
be repugnant-are in fact intimately linked to the processes, course, and
development of the world, which in turn can be traced back to universal
Reason. Marcus goes farther still (III, 2) :
We must also bear in mind things like the following: even the
accessory consequences of natural phenomena have something
graceful and attractive about them. For instance: when bread is
baked, some parts of it develop cracks in their surface. Now, it is
precisely these small openings which, although they seem somehow
to have escaped the intentions which presided over the making of
the bread, somehow please us and stimulate our appetite in a quite
particular way. Or take figs as an example: when they are perfectly
ripe, they split open. In the case of ripe olives, it is precisely the
proximity of rot which adds a unique beauty to the fruit. Ears of
corn which bend toward the earth; the lion's wrinkled brow; the
foam trailing from the mouth of boars: these things, and many
others like them, would be far from beautiful to look at, if we
considered them only in themselves. And yet, because these secondary
aspects accompany natural processes, they add a new adornment
to the beauty of these processes, and they make our hearts
glad. Thus, if one possesses experience and a thorough knowledge
of the workings of the universe, there will be scarcely a single one
of those phenomena which accompany natural processes as a consequence
which will not appear to him, under some aspect at least, as
The Discipline of Desire
pleasant. Such a person will derive no less pleasure from contemplating
the actual gaping jaws of wild beasts than he does from all
the imitations which painters and sculptors provide thereof. His
pure eyes will be able to see a kind of flourishing maturity in aged
men and women, as well as a kind of amiable charm in children.
Many such cases will occur, and it is not just anyone who can derive
pleasure from them. Rather, only that person who has become truly
familiar with Nature and her works will do so.
It is worthwhile to compare these lines with Aristotle's preface to his
Parts ef Animals (644b3 rff.) :
In fact, some of the creatures in this world do not have a pleasant
appearance. Nature, however, who has created them, provides
whoever contemplates her with marvelous enjoyments, as long as
one is able to recognize the principles of natural phenomena, and is
of a philosophical nature. It would, moreover, be illogical and absurd
if we took pleasure in contemplating reproductions of such
creatures-since, as we contemplate them, we simultaneously admire
the talent of the artist, be he painter or sculptor-and yet did
not feel still more joy while contemplating the very beings which
Nature has created-at least when we are able to discern their
principles. This is why we must not yield to any kind of childish
repugnance when we are examining some of the less noble animals,
for there is something wonderful in all that is natural.
It is the creatures themselves, as produced by Nature, which interest
Aristotle. According to the Stagirite, even if these creatures have a terrifying
or repulsive appearance, the philosopher, insofar as he recognizes
the creative power of Nature within them, can discover their beauty. For
Marcus, by contrast, as we have seen, such creatures are to be explained
as the consequences, both necessary and accessory, of the natural phenomena
which result from the initial decision, yet seem to humankind to
be contrary to Nature's intentions-snake venom, for instance, or the
thorns on roses. In the final analysis, however, Marcus also recognizes in
these consequences the creative power of Nature. Even though such
consequences do not fit within the classical canon of beauty, they nevertheless,
insofar precisely as they are the consequences of natural phenomena,
"have something charming and attractive about them."
Our baker would like to have given his bread a perfectly regular form.
THE I N NER CITA D EL
When it is baked, however, the bread takes on unforseeable forms, and
cracks in unexpected ways. Likewise, the general movement of the universe
should be completely rational, and yet, when this movement occurs,
there also occur concomitant, accessory phenomena which go
above and beyond Nature's intentions, and the impulse which she gave
at the beginning. Just as in the case of the bread, however, it is precisely
such anomalies and irregularities-these cracks in the crust, if you willwhich
make us sense that the bread is crusty, and stimulate our appetite.
For Aristotle, only the philosopher could perceive the beauty of the
products of Nature, for it was he who could discover Nature's plan: a
force which ensured the growth of beings from within. Marcus, too,
holds that only the philosopher or the sage-someone who possesses
experience and a deep understanding of the processes of the universecan
feel the beauty and grace of the phenomena which accompany
natural processes. This is because only he can perceive the link between
these natural processes and their necessary accompaniments.
In the place of an idealistic aesthetics, which considered beautiful only
that which manifested the ideal form and the canons of proportion,
Aristotle, Marcus, and the entire Hellenistic period substituted a realistic
aesthetics. For them, living reality, in its nudity and even in its horror, is
more beautiful than beautiful imitations. "An ugly man," as Plotinus57
was to say, "if he is alive, is more beautiful than a man represented in a
statue, however beautiful he may be."
Here the perspective has been utterly transformed. Things which used
to appear repulsive, disgusting, or terrifying now become beautiful to the
eyes of the person familiar with Nature, precisely because they exist, are
natural, and are part of the natural processes which flow indirectly from
Nature's intentions.
Like Nature (IX, r, 9) , we must not make any distinctions between
indifferent things, which depend not upon us, but on universal Nature.
Dirt, mud, thorns, and poison come from the same source and are just as
natural as roses, the sea, or spring. In the eyes of Nature, and of people
familiar with Nature, there is no difference to be made between bathwater
and the rest of life: everything is equally "natural." We are fairly
close to Nietzsche here: "Everything which is necessary, when seen from
above and from the point of view of the vast economy of the whole, is in
itself equally useful. We must not only put up with it, but love it. "58
Familiarity with Nature is one of the fundamental attitudes of one
who practices the discipline of desire. Being familiar with Nature means
recognizing things and events as familiar, and realizing that they belong
The Discipline ofDesire 171
to the same world, and come from the same source, as we do. It thus
means " doing physics" in the sense of becoming aware of the unity of
Nature and its accord with itself He who is familiar with Nature associates
himself with Nature's self-accordance; in Marcus' words, he is "no
longer a stranger in his homeland," and is "a man worthy of the world
which has engendered him" (XII, l, 5) .
It is only when one considers the things in life from a cosmic perspective
that they can appear both beautiful and valueless: beautiful, because
they exist, and yet valueless because they cannot accede to the realm of
freedom and morality. Instead, they vanish rapidly into the infinity of
space and time, and the uninterrupted flux of becoming (VI, 15, 2) :
In the midst of this river, in which one cannot stand still, who could
attach any value to any of the things which flow past?
Marcus never tires of contemplating the great laws of Nature. He is
particularly fascinated by the perpetual metamorphoses of all things, and
this is what he is constantly trying to contemplate:
Acquire a method for contemplating how all things are transformed
into each other: concentrate your attention on this ceaselessly and
exercise yourself on this point (X, l l) .
When you regard each substance, imagine that it is already being
dissolved, is in the midst of transformation, in the process of rotting
and being destroyed (X, 1 8).
Thus, Marcus tries to perceive the process of dissolution already at
work in the people and objects which surround him. He would certainly
have approved of Princess Bibesco, who, in order to meditate upon
death, had only to contemplate a bouquet of violets. 59 Marcus recalls the
imperial courts of the past-that of Augustus, for example-in order to
realize that all these people who have, for an instant, come back to life in
his memory are in fact long dead. This is no more a case of obsession
with death or morbid complacency than when, in the film The Dead
Poets' Society, Robin Williams, who plays a teacher of literature, makes
his students carefully study a picture of the school's old boys. In order
that his students appreciate the value of life, the teacher wants them to
become aware that all the boys in the picture-apparently so alive-are
now dead. He hopes they will thereby discover life's preciousness, as he
1 72 THE I N NER CITADEL
instills in them Horace's saying Carpe diem (" Seize the day!") . The only
difference in these two outlooks is that for Marcus the only value is not
just life itself, but moral life.
Marcus' vision of universal metamorphosis teaches us not to fear
death, which is only a particular instance of such metamorphosis (II, 12,
3), and not to attribute any value to transitory things (IX, 28, 5). At the
same time, however, it sweeps the soul along toward the contemplation
of the grandiose spectacle of Nature, which constantly transforms all
things " so that the world may always be new" (VII, 25) .
In the immensity of the universe, and the infinity of time and space,
Marcus annihilates himself in a kind of intoxicated vertigo, as many
others had done before him.
Such a vision of the totality of substance and of time can be obtained
by a view from above:60 that is, the soul's flight above all things, in the
immensity of the universe (IX, 3 2):
You will open up a vast field for yourself as you embrace the totality
of the cosmos in your thought, conceive everlasting eternity, and
consider the rapid metamorphosis of each individual thing.
Marcus allows himself to be swept along by the revolutions of the
stars, and the torrential metamorphosis of the elements (VII, 4 7) :
For such images purify us from the stains of terrestrial life.
Marcus plunges in thought into a universe which conforms to the
Stoic model: a universe, that is, which is finite within the immensity of
the surrounding void, and which ceaselessly repeats itself within the
infinity of time (XI, l, 3):
The soul traverses the entire world and the void which surrounds it,
as well as its form; it extends itself throughout the infinity of eternity,
and it embraces and conceives the periodic rebirth of the
universe.
Human beings are made for infinity, and their true city and fatherland
is the immensity of the whole world. In the words of Seneca:61
How natural it is for man to extend his spirit throughout all immensity
. . . The only limits which the human soul allows are those
The Discipline ofDesire 1 73
which it shares with God himself . . Its fatherland is everything
which the sky and the world contain.
One of the things, says Marcus, which is peculiar to mankind, and which
fills him with joy, is to contemplate the Nature of the All, as well as
everything which happens in conformity with what Nature has willed
(VIII, 26) .
The first result of this spiritual exercise of the view from above or
cosmic flight of the soul is to reveal to people both the splendor of the
universe and the splendor of the spirit. Another of its effects, however, is
that it furnishes powerful instigations for practicing the discipline of
desire. Human affairs, when seen from above, seem very tiny and puny;
they are not worthy of being desired, nor does death appear as something
to be feared.
From such a perspective, Asia and Europe are nothing but a tiny
comer of the world; the sea is a drop of water; Mt. Athos is a mound of
earth; and the present moment nothing more than a point (VI, 3 6).
Mankind's place and role are minuscule amidst such immensity (XII, 32).
And what of the minuscule swarms of human beings crawling all over
the earth?
Crowds, armies, farmers; weddings, divorces, births, deaths; the
hubbub of the courts; deserted places; the diversity of the customs
of barbarous peoples; celebrations, lamentations; marketplaces: what
a hodgepodge! And yet, there is the harmony of contraries (VII,
48) .
This effort to look at things from above thus allows us to contemplate
the entire panorama of human reality in all its aspects-social, geographical,
and emotional-and to resituate them within the immensity of the
cosmos and the human species, swarming anonymously over the earth.
When we look at things from the perspective of universal Nature, those
things which do not depend on us, and which the Stoics called "indifferent"-health,
glory, wealth, and death, for example-are brought back
to their true proportions.
When this theme of the view from above assumes this specific form of
observing people on earth, it seems particularly to belong to the Cynic
tradition. We find it used abundantly by the satirist Lucian, a contemporary
of Marcus Aurelius, who was strongly influenced by Cynicism. In
Lucian's dialogue Icaromenippus, or "The Man Who Rose Above the
1 74 THE I N NER CITA D EL
Clouds, "62 the Cynic Menippus tells a friend how, discouraged by the
disagreement among philosophers about the ultimate principles of the
universe, he decided to go up to the heavens himself, in order to see how
things really were. In order to fly, Menippus fixed himself up with wings:
the right wing was that of an eagle, and the left that of a vulture. He then
took off in the direction of the moon. Once there, he could see the
entire earth from above, and just like Homer's Zeus, he says, he could
observe now the land of the Thracians, now that of the Mysians-even,
if he wished, the lands of Greece, Persia, and India. Such variety fills him
with pleasure, but he also observes the people:
The whole of human life appeared to me; not only the nations and
the cities, but every individual: some were sailing ships, others
waging war, and others on trial.
Menippus observes not only what is going on out in the open, but also
what is happening behind closed doors, where everyone thought they
were perfectly well hidden.63 After a lengthy enumeration of the crimes
and adulteries which he sees being committed inside the houses, Menippus
resumes his remarks, calling everything a hodge-podge, a cacophony,
and a ridiculous spectacle. In his view, the most ridiculous thing of all is
to see people quarreling over the borders of a nation, since the earth
appears minuscule to him. The rich, says Menippus, have darned little to
be proud about. Their lands are no bigger than one of Epicurus' atoms,
and when people gather together they resemble a swarm of ants. Menippus
finally leaves the moon and travels among the stars until he reaches
Zeus, where he is amused at the ridiculously contradictory nature of the
prayers which human beings send up to this god.
In another of Lucian's dialogues, entitled Charon or The Overseers, we
find Charon, ferryman of the dead, asking for a day off in order to go up
to the surface of the earth and see what life is like-this life which the
dead miss so much when they arrive in Hell. With the help of Hermes,
Charon piles several mountains on top of each other and climbs up on
them in order to observe human life. We then have the same kind of
description which we have already encountered in the Icaromenippus or in
Marcus Aurelius: an enumeration of sailing ships, armies at war, trials,
farmers working their fields-a wide variety of activities, but everywhere
life is full of torments. As Charon remarks, " If people realized from the
beginning that they are mortal, and that, after a brief sojourn in life, they
must leave it as they would a dream, and leave everything upon this
The Discipline of Desire 1 75
earth, then they would live more wisely and die with fewer regrets."
But, continues Charon, people are unaware of their condition, like the
bubbles produced by a raging stream, which vanish as soon as they are
formed.
This look from above at man's earthly life takes on a form peculiar to
Cynicism. One sign of this is the fact that the dialogue Charon bears the
Greek title Episkopountes, or " Those who watch." The Cynic philosopher,
for his part, believes that his role is to watch over people's actions.
He is a kind of spy, lying in wait for mankind's defects in order to
denounce them, as Lucian himself says.64 It is the Cynic's job to watch
over other men; he is their censor, and he observes their behavior as if
from the heights of an observatory. The Greek words episkopos (" overseer")
and kataskopos ("spy") , moreover, traditionally designate the Cynics
in the ancient world. 65 For them, the view from above was meant to
denounce the senseless way in which people led their lives. It is no
accident that, in this dialogue, it is precisely Charon, ferryman of the
dead, who thus looks at human affairs from above; for looking at things
from above means looking at human affairs from the point of view of
death. Only this point of view can give us the detachment, elevation, and
distance which are indispensable in order for us to see things as they
really are.
The Cynics denounced that form of human madness which attaches
itself so passionately to things, such as luxury and power, which people
will inevitably have to abandon. This is why they urge them to reject
superfluous desires, social conventions, and artificial civilization-all of
which are the source of their worries, cares, and sufferings-and encourage
them to return to a simple, purely natural style oflife.
Thus, our philosopher-emperor coincides with Lucian, the ancient
equivalent of Voltaire, in this imaginative exercise of the view from
above, which is also a view of things from the point of view of death. It
is, moreover, a merciless view, which strips false values naked.
Among these false values is fame. Marcus came up with remarkable
formulas to denounce our desire to be known, either by our contemporaries
or by posterity:
Short is the time which each of us lives; puny the little comer of
earth on which we live; how puny, finally, is even the lengthiest
posthumous glory. Even this glory, moreover, is transmitted by little
men who'll soon be dead, without even having known themselves,
much less him who has long since been dead (III, ro, 2) .
THE I N NER CITA D EL
Are you obsessed with a little bit of glory? Turn your eyes to the
rapidity with which everything is forgotten. Think about the abyss
of eternity, infinite in both directions; and about the vanity of the
echo which reaches us. Think about how quickly those who now
seem to be applauding change their minds, and have no judgment;
think also about the narrowness of the space by which your fame is
circumscribed. The whole earth is no more than a point, and of this
point only the tiniest part is inhabited. From such an origin, how
many people will there be to sing your praises, and of what character?
(IV, 3, 7-8) .
Soon, you will have forgotten everything; soon, everyone will have
forgotten you ... (VII, 2 1 ) .
In a short time, you will no longer be anything or anywhere ..
(VI, 3 7) .
While the view from above reveals that human affairs are only an
infinitesimal point within the immensity of reality, it also allows us to
discover what Marcus calls to homoeides, which we could render as both
the identity and the homogeneity of all things. This is an ambiguous
notion: it can mean, for example, that in the eyes of one who plunges his
gaze into the cosmic immensity, everything is within everything else.
Everything holds itself together, and the entire universe is present in each
instant of time, as well as in each part of reality (VI, 3 7):
He who has seen the present has seen everything: all that has occurred
from all eternity, and all that will occur throughout infinity,
for everything is homogeneous and identical in form.
Death, then, will not deprive me of anything, since I have already, within
each instant, had everything. At any moment at which the limits of its life
cease, the soul attains its end. Within each present moment, I possess
everything I can expect from life: the presence of the entire universe and
presence of universal Reason, which is the presence of one and the same
thing. At each moment, I possess all of Being, present in the least of
things.
If, however, we are afraid to die, because we would like to continue
enjoying life, honors, pleasures, and all other false human values, then to
homoeides, or homogeneity, takes on a different meaning. For one who
The Discipline of Desire 1 77
has discovered true value-that of Reason, which rules within us and
within the entire universe-these elements oflife, which endlessly repeat
their pettiness and banality, are just as disgusting as the games in the arena
(VI, 46) .
When human affairs are viewed from above, we are able to imagine
the past as well as the future, and this view reveals that even if individuals
disappear, the same scenes are repeated throughout the centuries. The
soul which extends itself throughout the immensity of space and time
sees that those who will come after us will see nothing new, and
that those who came before us saw nothing more than we did.
Rather, there is a sense in which a man offorty, if he has some slight
measure of intelligence, has seen everything there has been, and
everything that will be, because of the uniformity of things (XI,
I, 3).
Marcus returns to this idea frequently and insistently (XII, 24, 3):
Each time you are elevated in this way, looking at human affairs
from above, you would see the same things: uniformity and brevity.
And to think that this is what men brag about!
Marcus imagines the imperial courts of his predecessors: Hadrian and
Antoninus Pius, for example; or those of former times: Philip, Alexander,
or Croesus:
All these uniform scenes and dramas, whether you have come to
know them through personal experience or through ancient history
. . . All these spectacles were the same, and only the actors
were different (X, 27, r-2) .
For the ancients, history always repeats itself. This, moreover, is the
reason why historians of that time wrote history. As Thucydides declared
in his Histories (I, 22, 4) : " For all those who wish to have a clear idea both
of past events and of those in the future which, because of their human
character, will bear similarities or analogies to them, this exposition will
be useful, and shall suffice." From this point of view, it must be admitted
that Thucydides' work was an extraordinary success, for his description
of the hypocrisy of the victorious and the strong remains appallingly
relevant.
THE I N NER CITADEL
Marcus, for his part, would no doubt have approved of Schopenhauer's
views on history:
From beginning to end, it is the repetition of the same drama, with
different costumes and names . . . This identical element, which
persists throughout all changes, consists in the basic qualities of the
human heart and head-many of them are bad; a few of them good.
History's overall motto ought to be Eadem, sed aliter. One who has
read Herodotus has, from a philosophical point of view, already
studied enough history, for his work already contains everything
which constitutes the subsequent history of the world. 66
When Marcus mentions this uniformity, by contrast, he has not the
slightest intention of elaborating a philosophy of history. On the contrary,
we ought rather to say that the view from above which he takes of
human affairs leads him to evaluate them: in other words, to denounce
their pseudo-value, especially when considered from the point of view of
death.
These spectacles which repeat themselves identically throughout one's
life and throughout the ages are almost always scenes of human evil,
hypocrisy, and futility. It makes no difference whether one sees them for
forty years, or for ten thousand (VII, 49, 2) . Death will deliver us from
this spectacle, as tiring as the games of the amphitheater (VI, 46) ; or at
least it will not make us miss anything, since it is impossible for anything
new to happen.
The Epicurean Lucretius had already placed a similar argument in the
mouth of Nature, as she tried to console mankind with regard to the
inevitability of his death: "I cannot think up some new invention to
please you, for things are eternally the same ... you must always expect
the same things, even if you were never to die. "67
Once again, we can see that the declarations contained in the Meditations,
which modern historians have classified as pessimistic, do not correspond
to Marcus Aurelius' impressions or experiences. The only personal
experience which seems to be expressed in his work is that of
disappointment with regard to his entourage, but I shall return to this
point later. When Marcus says that human affairs are as nothing within
the immensity; that they are vile and petty; or that they repeat themselves
until one is sick of them, he is not expressing some negative experience
of his own. Instead, he is engaging in exercises, both spiritual and literary.
Sometimes, we feel that some of his wonderfully striking formulas are
The Discipline of Desire 1 79
even a bit artificial, since all they do is reproduce traditional themes of
ancient philosophy. In the final analysis, however, what inspires all this is
the love and fascination which Marcus feels in the depths of his being for
that unique Value, which is the only thing necessary. Does human life,
he asks, contain " anything more valuable than Justice, Truth, Temperance,
and Bravery" (III, 6, r)? The good worth more than anything else
is the feeling of inner joy which occurs when the guiding principle or
thought "is content with itself (in those things in which it is possible to
act in accordance with right reason) , and is content with Destiny (in
those things which are allotted to us, independently of our will) . . .
Choose this greatest of all goods, and never let it go " (III, 6, 6) .
This superior good is, in the last analysis, the inner God, which must
be "preferred to everything" (III, 7, 2) , and revered, since it is of the
same substance as the guiding principle which governs the world 0/, 2 I ) .
Your only joy, and your only rest: let it be to pass from one action
performed in the service of the community to another action performed
for the service of the community, together with the remembrance
of God 0/I, 7) .
It is this unique Value that brings joy, serenity, and rest to Marcus' soul.
Compared to this unique, transcendent Value, human affairs are petty
indeed; they are like a point within the immensity of the universe. In
fact, the only thing which is great compared to the latter is the purity of
moral intent. As Pascal would agree, moral good is infinitely greater than
physical size.
To anyone who has contemplated the immensity of the universe,
human affairs-to which we attach so much importance-seem petty,
unimportant child's play. As Marcus likes to repeat: "Everything is vile
and petty." Yet since human affairs are almost always alien to the moral
good, dominated as they are by passions, hatred, and hypocrisy, they
seem not only puny, vile, and petty, but also disgusting in their monotonous
baseness. The only greatness in earthly life-but also the only
joy-is therefore the purity of moral intent.
The Levels of Cosmic Consciousness
Earlier I spoke of the stages of consciousness of the self as a faculty of
freedom and moral choice. We can now return to this theme, in order to
1 80 THE I N NER CITA D EL
see how the various levels of self-consciousness correspond to different
levels of cosmic consciousness.
As long as the self has not yet gained awareness of its potential freedom,
and has not yet carried out the delimitation or circumscription of
this potential freedom in which the guiding principle consists, it believes
itself to be autonomous and independent of the world. In fact it is, as
Marcus says, a "stranger to the world" (IV, 29) , and it is swept along
against its will by Destiny. In the course of the movement by which it
becomes aware of the fact that it is not identical with the body, the vital
breath, or involuntary emotions, however, the self discovers that, up
until then, it had been unconsciously and passively determined by Destiny:
it had been nothing but a tiny point in the immensity of space, or a
little wave in the immense tide of time. The moment freedom becomes
aware of itself, however, it becomes aware of the fact that that self which
is determined by Destiny is only an infinitesimally tiny part of the world
(XII, 3 2):
What a tiny part of the gaping abyss of infinite time is assigned to
each one of us! For it disappears so quickly into the everlasting.
What a tiny portion of universal substance, what a tiny part of the
universal soul! On how tiny a part of the entire earth do you crawl!
Our perspective is changed once again when the self, as a principle of
freedom, recognizes that there is nothing greater than the moral good,
and therefore accepts what has been willed by Destiny, that is to say,
universal Reason. If the self accepts itself as a principle of freedom and of
choice, it also accepts the portion which Destiny has allotted to it, as the
ego which has been determined by Destiny. As the Stoics used to say, the
self accepts the role which the divine director has reserved for it in the
drama of the universe;68 in Marcus' case, for instance, this role was that of
emperor. As the self accepts this role, however, it becomes transfigured:
for what the free self wills is all of Destiny, the entire history of the world,
and the entire world, as if the self were that universal Reason which is at
the origin of the world, or universal Nature. At this point, the self as will
and as freedom coincides with the will of universal Reason and of the
logos dispersed throughout all things.
The realization of one's self as identical with universal Reason, then, as
long as it is accompanied by consent to this will, does not isolate the self
like some minuscule island in the universe. On the contrary, it can open
the self to all cosmic becoming, insofar as the self raises itself from its
The Discipline of Desire 181
limited situation and partial, restricted, and individualistic point of view
to a universal and cosmic perspective. At this point, self-consciousness
becomes consciousness of the world, and consciousness of the divine
Reason which guides the world. Finally, we may say that the self, by
means of this process of realization, discovers both its limitation and its
transcendence. It discovers the limitation of its individuality within the
immensity of the universe-this is a theme which recurs frequently in
Pascal's Pensees: "I am nothing but an unimportant thing in the abyss of
time and space" -and this is the limitation of the self as determined by
Destiny. At the same time, however, it discovers the transcendence of
the self as moral conscience, whose value is somehow infinite with
regard to the merely physical domain.
We find this opposition between the self caught up in the web of the
universe and of Destiny and the self which identifies itself with universal
Reason already in Epictetus (I, 12, 26) :
Don't you know how tiny a part you are, compared to the All?
With regard to your body, that is; for with regard to your reason,
you are not worse nor lesser than the gods. The size of reason
cannot be measured by length or height, but by the value of judgments
(dogma; or " of principles of action") .
Perhaps I may be allowed here to refer to a similar opposition, between
the puniness of the empirical self, plunged in the immensity of the
world, and the incommensurable grandeur of the moral self as the legislative
power of reason, which we find in the last pages of Kant's Critique ef
Practical Reason:
Two things fill the soul with ever-new and ever-growing admiration
and awe, the more frequently and constantly one applies one's
reflection to them: the starry sky above me and the moral law within me.
These are two things which I have neither to search for, nor simply
to presuppose, as if they were shrouded in darkness or plunged
within a transcendent region, beyond my horizon: I can see them in
front of me and I attach them immediately to the consciousness of
my existence. The former begins at that place which I occupy within
the sensible world, and extends my connection to that which is immensely
large, with its worlds upon worlds and its systems of systems,
in addition to the unlimited times of their periodic movement,
their beginning and their duration. The latter begins at my
1 82 THE I N NER CITADEL
invisible self, or personality, and it represents me within a world
which possesses a genuine infinity, but which can be detected only
by the understanding, and with which (and thereby also with all
these visible worlds) I realize that I am in a relationship of ...
universal and necessary linkage. The first spectacle, that of an innumerable
multitude of worlds, somehow annihilates my importance
qua that of a bestial creature which must return to the planet-a
mere point in the universe-the matter out of which it was formed,
after having been-one knows not how-provided with vital force
for a brief span of time. The second spectacle, by contrast, increases
my value in.finitely, qua that of an intelligence, thanks to my personality
within which the moral law displays to me a life independent
with regard to animality, and even with regard to the entire sensible
world.69
Obviously, Marcus Aurelius would not have accepted this Kantian
distinction between a sensible and an intelligible world. For him, as for
all the Stoics, there is one single world, just as, he says, there is one single
law which is that reason common to all intelligent beings (VII, 9) . For
Marcus and the Stoics, however, it is the self's awareness of itself which
transforms it, making it pass in succession from the domain of necessity to
the domain of freedom, and from the domain of freedom to the domain
of morality. The self-that infinitesimal point within the immensity-is
thereby transformed, and made equal to universal Reason.

THE DISC IPLINE OF A C TION, OR
ACTION IN THE SERVIC E OF MAN KIND
The discipline of action
The result of the discipline of desire, as we saw, was to bring people inner
serenity and peace of mind, since it consisted in the joyful consent to
everything that happens to us through the agency of universal Nature
and Reason. Amor Jati, or the love of fate, thus led us to want that which
the cosmos wants, to want what happens, and to want what happens
to us.
This fine serenity risks being disturbed by the discipline of active
impulse and action, since in this case it is a matter of acting, not accepting.
We now must engage our responsibility, not just consent; and we
must enter into relations with beings-our fellow creatures-who provoke
our passions precisely because they are our fellow creatures: beings
whom we must love, although they are often hateful.
Here again, the norm will be found to be conformity with Nature:
not, this time, that universal Nature which we know in general to be
rational, but one of the more specific and determinate aspects of this
universal Nature: human Nature, the Nature of the human race, or that
Reason which all people have in common. This is a particular norm,
which is the basis of precise obligations: insofar as we are parts of the
human race, we must
( r ) act in the service of the whole;
(2) in our actions, respect the hierarchy of values which may exist between
different types of action; and
(3) love all human beings, since we are all the members of one single
body.
Another way of putting it would be to say that humankind is ruled by
the laws of four natures. In the first place, people, as parts of the All, are
THE I N NER CITA D EL
ruled by universal Nature. They must consent to the great laws of this
Nature-in other words, to Destiny and to the events willed by this
universal Nature. For the Stoics, however, who had developed an entire
theory of the lower levels of Nature, the Greek word physis which we
translate as "nature " can also, when used without a qualifier, mean the
faculty of growth which is peculiar to each organism. Plants possess
nothing but this faculty of growth, while human beings have it within
them, alongside other faculties. It is this faculty, for instance, which
forces people to feed themselves and to reproduce. We must, says Marcus
(X, 2) also observe the demands of this law of vegetative "nature ." For
instance, we have the " duty"-1 shall return to the meaning of this
term-to conserve ourselves by nourishing ourselves, as long as the
satisfaction of this demand has no negative effects upon the other internal
faculties which we have within us. For human beings are not only a
"faculty of growth" (physis), but also a "faculty of sensation": this is a
higher level, which also goes into the constitution of humankind. Marcus
(X, 2) calls it a "force " or " nature " of the animal. This law of
animality also has its own demands with regard to humankind: in this
case, self-conservation is achieved through the vigilance of the senses.
Here again, we have the duty to carry out our functions as animals
provided with sensation, as long as the higher inner faculties are not
thereby damaged. To exaggerate the role of sensation would mean compromising
the workings of Nature, that faculty higher than sensation
which is also called reason.
All this, then, corresponds to the discipline of action, which implies all
the acts and movements which respond to the requirements of integral
human nature. As we have seen, this nature is, at the same time, the
faculty of growth, of sensation, and of reason. Marcus is then quick to
add (X, 2) : " The rational faculty is simultaneously the faculty of social
life"; in other words, the law of human and social reason demands that
we place ourselves entirely in the service of the human community.
In many of his Meditations, Marcus emphasizes the symmetrical opposition
which arises between the discipline of action and the discipline of
desire. For example:
Act as your own nature commands you; put up with whatever common
Nature brings to you (XII, 32, 3).
Am I really carrying out an action? I am carrying it out, when I relate
it to the good of humankind. Is something happening to me? I greet
The Discipline of Action
it by relating what happens to me to the gods and to the source of all
things, whence the web of all events has its origin (VIII, 2 3) .
Impassivity (ataraxia) with regard to the events, brought about by the
exterior cause. Justice (dikaiosyne) in the actions brought about by the
cause that is within you. In other words, let your impulse to act and
your action have as their goal the service of the human community,
because that, for you, is in conformity with your nature (IX, 3 1).
He gave himself over entirely to justice, insofar as the actions which
he carried out are concerned, and to universal Nature with regard to
everything which happens to him (X, 1 1, 2) .
For Marcus Aurelius, then, as for Epictetus, the goal of our actions
must be the good of the human community, and the discipline of action
will therefore have as its domain our relations with other people. In tum,
these relations will be ruled by laws and the duties imposed by human,
rational nature and reason, which are fundamentally identical to universal
Nature and Reason.
The seriousness of action
The discipline of action, like the other disciplines m the domains in
which they are exercised, will therefore begin by imposing the norms of
reason and reflection upon human activity:
In the first place: nothing at random, and nothing that is not related
to some goal. Second: do not relate your actions to anything other
than a goal which may serve the human community (XII, 20) .
The human soul dishonors itself when it does not direct its actions
and impulses, as much as possible, toward some goal, but instead,
whatever it does, it does inconsiderately and without reflection,
whereas the least of our actions ought to be accomplished by being
related to its goal. And the goal of rational beings is to obey the
Reason and the Law of the most venerable of Cities and Republics
(II, 16, 6) .
In all that you do, make sure that you do not act at random, or
otherwise than Justice herself would act (XII, 24, 1).
1 86 THE I N NER CITADEL
The vice which is opposed to the discipline of action is thus frivolity
(eikaiotes). It is the opposite to that seriousness or gravity with which all
human actions should be accomplished. This human frivolity or lack of
reflection does not know how to submit to the discipline of action; it is
the agitation of a jumping jack, a puppet, or a top:
Stop letting the guiding principle within you be tugged around like
a marionette by the strings of selfish impulses (II, 2, 4) .
Cease this puppet-like agitation (VII, 29, 2) .
Stop spinning around like a top; instead, on the occasion of every
impulse to act, accomplish what is just, and whenever a representation
presents itself, confine yourself to what corresponds exactly
to reality (IV, 22) .
Acting seriously means, in the first instance, acting with all one's heart
and soul (XII, 29, 2) :
With all your soul, do what is just.
Marcus is here alluding to Epictetus, who reproached his apprentice
philosophers with failing to engage themselves seriously in the philosophical
life; like children, he says,
. . . one minute you are an athlete, then a gladiator; the next a
philosopher, then a rhetor; but you are nothing with all your soul
... because you haven't undertaken anything after having examined
it, looked at the matter from all angles, and thoroughly tested
it; instead, you've engaged yourself casually and with a desire that
has no warmth in it (III, I 5, 6) .
Marcus wanted to bring this warmth of the heart to his consent to the
will of universal Nature (III, 4, 4) as well as to his love of the Good (III,
6, l) , or his practice of justice (XII, 29, 2) .
To act seriously is also to become aware of the infinite value of each
instant, when one thinks of the possible imminence of death (II, 5, 2) :
Carry out each action of your life as if it were the last, and keep
yourself far from all frivolity.
The Discipline of Action
And again (VII, 69) :
What brings perfection to one's way oflife is to spend each day as if
it were the last; without agitation, without indolence, and without
role-playing.
The idea of death strips actions of their banality, and uproots them
from the routine of daily life. From this perspective, it is impossible to
accomplish any action without reflection or attention, for one's being
must be fully engaged in what may perhaps be the last opportunity it has
to express itself One can no longer wait or postpone purifying one's
intentions, in order to act "with all one's soul." Even if the action which
we are carrying out were in fact interrupted by death, this would not
make it incomplete; for what gives an action its completeness is precisely
the moral intention by which it is inspired, not the subject matter on
which it is exercised.
Acting seriously also means not dispersing oneself in feverish agitation.
In Meditations, IV, 24, Marcus quotes an aphorism by Democritus: "Act
little, if you want to maintain serenity." But Marcus immediately corrects
this statement, as follows:
Wouldn't it be better to say: Do what is indispensable, and do what
you are ordered to do by the reason of a naturally political animal,
and do it in the way you are ordered to do it? For that is what brings
serenity: not only because one acts well, but because one acts little.
For since the majority of our words and actions are not necessary, if
we cut them off, we will have more leisure and peace of mind.
Concerning each action, therefore, we must remind ourselves of
this question: Is this action not one of those which are not indispensable?
It is not only unnecessary actions which have to be eliminated,
however, but also unnecessary representations; if we eliminate
these, the actions to which they would give rise will not follow
either.
It is not, as Democritus seems to say, the mere fact of reducing the
number of one's actions which brings serenity, or the fact of not getting
involved in many things, but the fact of limiting one's activities to that
which serves the common good. This is the only thing necessary, and it
alone brings joy, because everything else causes only troubles and wornes.

r88 THE I N NER CITADEL
When he adds that this principle of action allows us to find leisure,
however, Marcus is not taking his own experience into account. Fronto,
Marcus' friend and rhetoric teacher, when urging him to take a rest at
Alsium on the seashore, speaks of the days and nights without interruption
which Marcus used to spend at his judicial responsibilities, and of the
scruples which tormented him: " If you condemn someone, you say: 'it
looks as though he wasn't given enough guarantees. "'1
I will have more to say about the worries and uncertainties brought
about by action. In any event, Marcus repeats throughout the Meditations
that we can save a great deal of time by eliminating useless activities, such
as trying to find out what other people have done, said, or thought (IV,
1 8):
Do not spend any more time than 1s necessary on insignificant
matters (IV, 32, 5).
In a sense, becoming aware of the seriousness which we must bring to
every action is precisely the same thing as becoming aware of the infinite
value of each instant, from the perspective of death (VIII, 2) :
On the occasion of each action, ask yourself this question: What is it
to me? Will I not regret it? In a short time, I will be dead, and
everything will disappear! If I now act as an intelligent living being,
who places himself in the service of the human community and
who is equal to God, then what more can I ask?
If we become aware of the value of the slightest instant, and if we
consider our present actions as the last ones of our life, how could we
waste our time in useless and futile acts?
"Appropriate actions" (ta kathekonta)
Epictetus often repeats that the exercise-theme whose object is active
impulses and actions corresponds to the domain of what the Stoics called
the kathekonta, usually translated as "the duties." Marcus Aurelius is not
explicit on this point, but when, in the context of this exercise-theme, he
speaks of actions performed "in the service of the human community"
(IX, 6; XI, 3 7), he is using Epictetus' terminology, and thereby shows his
familiarity with the latter's doctrine. Within the Stoic system, moreover,
human actions necessarily belong to the domain of the kathekonta.
The Discipline of Action
Let me briefly resituate this notion within the totality of Stoic teaching.
Its fundamental principle, as we have seen, is that there is no good
but the moral good. What is it, however, that makes a good a moral
good? In the first place, the fact that it is located within humankind, and
the things which depend on us: thought, active impulses, and desire.
Second, our thought, active impulse, and desires must wish to conform
to the law of Reason. There must be an effective will, wholly oriented
toward doing the good. Everything else, therefore, is indifferent, which
means it is without intrinsic value. As examples of indifferent things, the
Stoics enumerated life, health, pleasure, beauty, strength, renown, and
noble birth-as well as their opposites: death, sickness, pain, ugliness,
weakness, poverty, obscurity, and humble birth. All these things do not,
in the last analysis, depend on us, but on Destiny, and they do not
provide us either with happiness or with unhappiness, since happiness is
located only in our moral intentions. Here, however, a twofold problem
arises: on the one hand, it is not enough to want to do good; we must also
know what concrete acts to undertake. On the other hand, how should
we live and orient ourselves in life, if everything that does not depend on
us is neither good nor bad? This is where the theory of "duties" or
" appropriate actions"2 (kathekonta), or of "suitable things, "3 comes in. It is
intended to provide a field for exercising our good will, and to provide
us with a practical code of conduct which would, in the last analysis,
allow us to make distinctions between indifferent things, and to accord a
relative value to things which are, in principle, without any value.
Here, we can glimpse the "physical" roots of Stoic ethics. In order to
determine what concrete actions must be performed, the Stoics take as
their starting-point a fundamental animal instinct, which expresses the
will of Nature. By virtue of a natural impulse which impels animals to
love themselves and to accord preference to themselves, they tend to
preserve themselves and to reject whatever threatens their integrity. It is
in this way that what is " appropriate " to nature is revealed to natural
instinct. With the appearance of reason in human beings, natural instinct
becomes reflective choice.4 At this stage, we recognize rationally which
things have "value," since they correspond to the innate tendencies
which nature has placed within us. Thus, it is "natural" for us to love life,
for parents to love their children, and that human beings, like ants and
bees, should have an instinct of sociability: that is, that they should be
prepared by nature to form groups, assemblies, and cities. Getting married,
engaging in a political activity, serving one's country, are all "appropriate
" to human nature and therefore have a "value." Nevertheless,
THE INNER CITADEL
from the point of view of the fundamental principles of Stoicism, all
these things are indifferent-nether good nor bad-since they do not
depend entirely upon us.
Thus, we can see what the Stoics meant by "appropriate actions"­
appropriate, that is, to Nature-and " duties" (kathekonta). They are actions,
hence something which depends upon us; and they presuppose an
intention, either good or evil. They cannot, therefore, be accomplished
indifferently. These actions are related to a subject matter which is, in
theory, indifferent, since it does not depend exclusively upon us, but also
on other people and on circumstances, external events, and, in the last
analysis, on Destiny. This indifferent subject matter can, however, reasonably
and with some probability be judged to be in conformity with
the will of Nature, and thereby to acquire a certain value, either by
virtue of its content, or by virtue of its circumstances.
Such " appropriate actions" are also " duties"; more precisely, they are
social and political obligations linked to human life in a city. As we have
seen, they include the duty not to do anything which is not in the service
of human groups, be they one's city or family; the duty to participate in
political activity and in the responsibilities of a citizen; to defend one's
country; to procreate and raise children; and to respect the bonds of
marriage. Epictetus enumerates some of these "duties" when he reviews
the actions which permit us to recognize the true philosopher (III, 21,
4-6) :
A carpenter doesn't come to you and say, "Listen to me discourse
on the art of carpentry"; but he draws up a contract to build a
house, builds it, and thereby shows that he possesses the carpenter's
art. Do as he does: eat like a human being, drink like a human
being, get spruced up, get married, have children, lead the life of a
citizen, learn how to put up with insults, tolerate an unreasonable
brother, father, son, neighbor, or traveling companion. Show us
these things, so that we can see if you really have learned anything
from the philosophers.
Uncertainty and worry
In the context of the discipline of action, along with such " duties,"
"appropriate actions," and "suitable things," uncertainty and worry are
liable to creep into the philosopher's soul. In the first place, the result of
such actions-the initiative for which depends on us, but the result of
The Discipline of Action 191
which does not-is far from being a sure thing. To the question, "Ought
we to do good to someone who may be ungrateful?" Seneca5 replies as
follows:
When it comes to action, we can never wait until we have an
absolutely certain understanding of the entire situation. We only
take the path down which we are led by probability. Every " duty"
(efficium) must follow this path; for this is how we sow, sail, make
war, get married, and have children. In all these things, the result is
uncertain, but we nevertheless decide to undertake those actions
which we think have some hope of succeeding. . . . We go where
reason-and not the absolute truth-leads us.
According to Epictetus (II, 6, 9) :
Chrysippus was quite right to say, so long as the consequences
remain hidden from me, I remain attached to the things which are
best able to permit me to obtain that which is in conformity with
nature, for God himself has made me able to choose between things
of this kind. If, however, I knew for a fact that Destiny had reserved
sickness as my fate, then I would head toward it; for if the foot had
any intelligence, it would head toward the mud."
Thus, the Stoics do not only say "I don't know whether my action
will succeed." Rather, they also say: " Since I don't know in advance
what the results of my actions will be, and what Destiny has in store for
me, I have to make such-and-such a decision in accordance with probability
and a rational estimate, without any absolute certainty that I am
making the right choice or doing the right thing."
One of the most dramatic choices which a Stoic could face was that of
suicide. Stoicism considered that suicide-in specific circumstances and
for good reasons; in other words, according to rational probability-was
a choice open to the philosopher. Thus, even though life would seem to
be more in conformity with nature, circumstances can bring us to choose
death. Similarly, as we have just seen, Chrysippus used to say that the sage
would choose sickness rather than health, if he knew with certainty that
such was the will of Destiny.
In the area of rational and probabilistic choice, the Stoics tried to
define what ought to be done in various possible situations. Their treatises
entitled On Duties were, at least in part, manuals of casuistry, and
1 92 THE I N NER CITADEL
one can see from the differences in the judgment of particular cases that
existed between the leaders of the various schools that their "rationally
justified" choices could only be based upon probability. Here are some
examples, preserved by Cicero in his treatise On Duties, 6 of the cases
which were discussed in the schools, and of the divergent responses to
them. Is a man who sells his house obligated to disclose all of its defects to
a potential buyer? Yes, said Antipater of Tarsus; no, said Diogenes of
Babylon. During a food shortage, a businessman had bought wheat in
Alexandria, and was transporting it by boat to Rhodes. He knew that
other boats were following him, and that the price of grain would soon
go down. Should he say so? Yes, said Antipater; no, said Diogenes of
Babylon. Obviously, the position of Antipater is closer to the fundamental
principles of Stoicism, and the arguments he uses to justify his position
are the same ones used by Marcus Aurelius to found the discipline of
action:
You must care for the salvation of all human beings, and serve the
human community. Nature has fixed as a principle that your particular
usefulness should be the common usefulness; and, reciprocally,
that the common usefulness should be your particular usefulness
. . . You must remember that there is a community between
human beings, which has been formed by Nature herself7
It seems as though Epictetus-and therefore, in all probability, Marcus
Aurelius, who follows him-pictured himself as representing the more
orthodox tradition which, starting with Chrysippus, went on through
Antipater of Tarsus and Archedemus. Still, the fact that different Stoics,
while remaining faithful to the fundamental principles of the school,
could nevertheless propose completely different ethical choices in the
cases we just observed is a good indicator of the fact that there existed
some degree of uncertainty concerning the relationship between the
moral end-which was unanimously agreed upon-and the " appropriate
actions" which ought to be undertaken in order to attain it.
Stoicism is often regarded as a philosophy of certainty and intellectual
self-confidence. In fact, however, it was only to the sage-that is, to an
extremely rare being who represented more an inaccessible ideal than a
concrete reality-that the Stoics attributed infallibility and perfect soundness
of judgment. Most people, including philosophers-who, in their
own view, are precisely not sages-must painfully orient themselves
The Discipline of Action 1 93
within the uncertainty of everyday life, making choices which seem to
be justified reasonably-in other words, probabilistically.8
Moral intent, or the fire fed by all matter
Action thus risks introducing worry and care into the Stoic's life, to the
same extent to which he does good, and where he intends to do good.
By means of a remarkable reversal, however, it is precisely by becoming
aware of the transcendent value of doing good that the Stoic can regain
peace of mind and serenity, which will enable him to act effectively.
There is nothing surprising about this, for it is precisely within the moral
good-that is to say, the intention of doing good-that the good is
situated for the Stoics.
For the Stoics, intentions bear within themselves a value which
infinitely transcends all the obj ects and "matters" to which they are
applied, for these objects and matters are in themselves indifferent, and
only assume a value to the extent that they provide an opportunity for
intentions to be applied and become concrete. In sum, there is only one
will, profound, constant, and unshakable, and it manifests itself in the
most diverse actions, on the most diverse occasions and objects, all the
while remaining free and transcendent with regard to the subject matters
upon which it is exercised.
In Marcus Aurelius, but also in Epictetus and in Seneca,9 the vocabulary
of the discipline of action includes a technical term meaning "to act
'with a reserve clause"' (Greek hypexairesis; Latin exceptio) , which implies
the transcendence of intention with regard to its objects. The idea of a
"reserve clause" reminds us that, for the Stoics, act and intention to act
are fused into an inner discourse which enunciates, as it were, the plans
of the agent. According to Seneca, 10 the sage undertakes everything
"with a reserve clause," insofar as he says to himself
"I want to do thus and so, as long as nothing happens which may
present an obstacle to my action."
"I will sail the across the ocean, if nothing prevents me."
Putting matters this way may seem banal and useless; from the Stoic
point of view, however, it is full of meaning. In the first place, it reveals
to us the seriousness of Stoic "intention." To be sure, Seneca's formula
could be reduced to the following: "I want to do x, if I can"; and it
1 94 THE I N NER CITA D EL
would be easy to joke about such a "good intention," which quickly
gives up its goal at the first difficulty that arises. In fact, however, the
contrary is true. Stoic intentions are not "good intentions" but "intentions
that are good"-in other words, firm, determined, and resolved to
overcome all obstacles. It is precisely because the Stoic refuses to give up
easily on his decision that he formulates a reserve clause, in quasi-judiciary
terms. In the words of Seneca: 11
The sage does not change his decision, if everything remains entirely
what it was when he took it. . .. Elsewhere, however, he
undertakes everything "with a reserve clause" ... in his most steadfast
decisions, he allows for uncertain events.
Our intention to perform a certain action, therefore, after we have
weighed and pondered it at length, is firm and stable . This is one of the
examples that Marcus Aurelius had retained from his adoptive father,
Antoninus Pius (I, 16, l) : " Firm perseverance in decisions which are
taken after mature reflection." The "reserve clause" means that this firm
decision and intention always remain integral, even if an obstacle should
arise which prevents their realization. Such an obstacle is a part of what
the sage has foreseen, and it does not prevent him from willing what he
wants to do. In the words of Seneca:12
Everything succeeds for him, and nothing unexpected happens to
him, for he foresees that something may intervene which prevents
that which he has planned to carry out.
This Stoic attitude reminds one of the saying embedded in popular
wisdom: "Do what you must; let happen what may. " We must undertake
what we think is good, even if we foresee the failure of our undertaking,
because we must do what we must do. Stoicism, however, also
contains the idea that carrying out a certain action is not an end in itself
Here we see the emergence of an extremely important distinction:
that which opposes goal (skopos) and end (telos). Whoever has the firm,
fixed moral intention to carry out a given action is like an archer aiming
at a target (skopos). It does not depend entirely on him whether he hits
the target or not; likewise, he can only wish for the "goal" (skopos) with a
"reserve clause ": namely, on the condition than Destiny also wills it. In
the words of Cicero:13
The Discipline of Action 1 95
The shooter must do everything he can to hit the target (skopos),
and yet it is this act of doing everything in order to hit the target and
realize his plan, which is, if I may say, the end (telos) that the shooter
is seeking. It is this that corresponds to what we call the sovereign
good in life, whereas hitting the target is only something that can be
wished for, but is not something worthy of being sought after for its
own sake.
We encounter the same fundamental principle again and again: the
only absolute value is moral intention, and it alone depends entirely upon
us. It is not the result that counts-for this does not depend on us, but on
Destiny-but rather the intention one has when seeking this result. We
find this theme in Epictetus (II, 1 6, 5):
Show me a man who is anxious to know how he does something,
and is not worried about getting something, but about his act itself
... who, when he deliberates, worries about the deliberation itself,
and not about obtaining what the deliberation was about.
If our activity is animated by the perfectly pure intention of wishing
only for the good, it attains its goal at every instant, and has no need to
wait for its achievement and result to come from the future. Insofar as the
very exercise of action is an end in itself, one could compare moral action
to dance. In dance, however, the action remains incomplete if it is
interrupted. Moral action, by contrast, is perfect and complete at every
instant, as Marcus Aurelius remarks (XI, r, r-2) :
The rational soul achieves its proper end, wherever the limit of its
life may be. It is not as in dance or the theater or other such arts, in
which, if something comes along to interrupt them, the entire
action is incomplete. The action of the rational soul, by contrastin
all of its parts, and wherever it is considered-carries out its
projects fully and without fail, so that it can say: "I have achieved
my completion."
Elsewhere, Marcus writes (VIII, 3 2):
You must set your life in order by accomplishing your actions one
by one; and if each of them achieves its completion, insofar as is
THE I N NER CITAD EL
possible, then that is enough for you. What is more, no one can
prevent you from achieving its completion.
Here we can grasp-in the flesh, as it were-the fundamental Stoic
attitude. In the first place, the Stoic " composes" his life, by accomplishing
his actions one by one. In other words, he concentrates upon the
present instant and the action he is accomplishing right now, without
allowing himself to be troubled by the past or the future. As Marcus says
(VII, 68, 3):
For me, the present is constantly the matter on which rational and
social virtue exercises itself
Second, this concentration on the present introduces order into one's
life, allowing problems to be arranged in a series, so that " one is not
troubled by the representations of an entire life" and by the difficulties
which one may encounter (VIII, 3 6, 1 ) . It gives a harmonious form to
life, just as, as in a dance movement, one passes from one graceful
movement to another (VI, 7) :
Your only joy, and your only rest, is to pass from one action performed
in the service of the human community to another action
performed in the service of the human community, together with
the remembrance of God.
Third, each action upon which good intentions and good will are
focused finds its completion and its plenitude within itself, and no one
can prevent us from completing it and succeeding in it. This is the
paradox mentioned by Seneca, to the effect that even if the sage fails, he
succeeds. Marcus takes up this theme, by saying that no one can prevent
him from giving his own actions their completion and plenitude (VIII,
32):
No one can stop you from having it attain its completion.
-But surely something external will prevent it from being completed!

-Be that as it may, no one can stop you from acting with justice,
temperance, and prudence.
-But perhaps some other one of the action's effects will be
prevented?
The Discipline of Action 1 97
-Perhaps, but if you adopt an attitude of serenity with regard to
such an obstacle, and if you know how to return prudently to that
which you are able to do, then another action will instantly take the
place of the first one, and it will fit in with the harmony we are
talking about.
No one-that is, no power in the world-can prevent us from the
following actions: in the first place, from wishing to act with justice and
prudence, and therefore from practicing the virtue which we intend to
practice by making the decision to perform such an action. Yet Marcus
objects: what if the result of the action which we wished to perform
cannot be realized? Then the action will fail. Reason then replies: but
this will just provide the opportunity to practice another virtue: that of
the consent to Destiny, and perhaps also of choosing another action,
more appropriate to the situation. In turn, this new action will insert
itself into the ordered series of actions which embellishes our life.
With the mention of serene consent to Destiny, we return to the
discipline of desire. When we can no longer act as we wished, we must
not allow ourselves to be troubled by vain desires to do the impossible.
Instead, we must willingly accept the will of Destiny. Then we shall have
to return to action and the discipline of action, prudently taking all new
information into consideration. In the last analysis, then, a good person
can always find completion and plenitude, even if his action is interrupted
or impeded by some external cause, because it is perfect at each
instant, and in the very act of its exercise. Even if an obstacle should arise,
action makes of it a new source of exercises. This is what Marcus calls
"turning an obstacle upside down" (V, 20, 2) :
People can perfectly well prevent me from carrying out such-andsuch
an action. Thanks, however, to action "with a reserve clause "
and to "turning obstacles upside down," there can be no obstacle to
my intention (horme), nor to my disposition. For my thought (dianoia)
can "turn upside down" everything that presents an obstacle
to my action, and transform the obstacle into an object toward
which my impulse to act ought preferably to tend. That which
impeded action thus becomes profitable to action, and that which
blocked the road allows me to advance along the road.
When he speaks of "turning obstacles upside down," Marcus means
that if something becomes an obstacle to what I was doing, and thereby
THE I N NER CITADEL
to the exercise of a certain virtue that I was practicing, I can find in that
very obstacle the opportunity to practice another virtue. For example, if
someone were to devote himself to the service of the human community,
and thereby devoted himself to exercising the virtue of justice, then
a sudden illness would constitute an obstacle to this virtue, but it would
also provide the opportunity to exercise oneself in consenting to the will
of Destiny. At each instant, the good person tries to do what seems to
him in reasonable conformity with that which Reason wants. If, however,
Destiny reveals its will, then he accepts it wholeheartedly (VI, 50):
First try to persuade them, but act against their will, if the reasonable
order �ogos) of justice leads you that way. If, however, someone
violently stands in your way, then shift over to that disposition
which greets that which does not depend on us serenely and without
regrets, and use this obstacle to practice another virtue. And
remember that your impulse to act was always "with a reserve
clause," for you did not desire the impossible . What, then, did you
desire? Nothing other than to have such an impulse; and that you
have achieved.
Thus, we always come back to the fundamental will and intention to
be in conformity with reason. It is thanks to them that we have complete
inner liberty with regard to the objects of our action. The failure of a
given action does not trouble our serenity, for such a failure does not
prevent the action from being perfect in its essence and intention, and it
gives us the opportunity either to undertake a new action, better adapted
to circumstances, or else to discipline our desire by accepting the will of
Destiny. Thus, our basic intention and will find new fields for exercise
(IV, 1 ) :
If the principle which commands within us is in conformity with
Nature, it is always ready, when anything happens, to adapt itself
without difficulty to what is possible and what has been granted to
it. It does not like to restrict itself to one subject matter. No doubt it
directs its intention-"with a reserve clause "-toward objects worthy
of being preferred; but if something else is substituted for these
objects, then it turns it into matter for itself, just like fire, which
triumphs over everything thrown upon it, by which a feeble flame
could easily be extinguished. A quick and violent fire, by contrast,
The Discipline of Action 1 99
quickly assimilates and consumes all that is brought to it, and it is
thanks to these very objects that it rises to such great heights.
The paradox of fire, which grows stronger the more things are
brought to it which could smother it, or at least present an obstacle to it,
is the same as the paradox of the good will. The latter is not content with
one field of exercise, but assimilates all objects, including the most diverse
goals, communicating its goodness and perfection to all the events
to which it consents. Fire and the good will are thus utterly free with
regard to the matter they use; their matter is indifferent to them, and the
obstacles which are set in their way do nothing but feed them. In other
words, nothing is an obstacle for them (X, 3 I, 5):
What kind of matter or exercise-theme are you fleeing! What is all
that, after all, if not exercises for your reason, which has seen, with
precision and an exact knowledge of Nature, the phenomena of
life? Hold fast, then, until you have assimilated these things as well,
as a robust stomach assimilates everything to itself, or as a bright fire
transforms everything thrown into it into flames and light.
Seneca, using a different metaphor, had already said:
A good person dyes events with his own color ... and turns whatever
happens to his own benefit.14
The paradox of fire is also that of divine Reason or universal Nature,
which the Stoics conceived as a spiritual fire (VIII, 3 5) :
Just as universal Nature has communicated to each rational being its
other powers, so we have received from her the following power:
just as she takes everything which bars her route and resists her, and
turns it around in her favor, reinserts it within the order of Nature,
and transforms it into a part of herself, in the same way rational
beings can turn everything which presents an obstacle to them into
their own matter, and use it, no matter what goal their intention
was first directed toward.
Let us note one thing from this comparison between divine action and
the sage's action: the idea of one unique intention, which transcends all
the subject matters to which it is applied. The unique intention of God,
200 THE I N NER CITA D EL
which is at the ongm of the world, wants the good of the All; in
particular, it wants the good of that summit of the All constituted by
rational beings. With a view to this end, God's good intention makes
everything-even obstacles and resistances-turn out for the best. The
unique intention of the sage comes to identify itself with this divine
intention, by wanting only what divine goodness wants: primarily, the
good of other rational beings. It, too, transforms every obstacle which
opposes the realization of a given action or a specific goal into good,
insofar as it utilizes such obstacles in order to consent to the will of God
or of universal Nature. Thus, for the good will, everything is good.
Inner freedom with regard to actions: the purity and
simplicity of intentions
Ancient philosophy had long reflected on how to do good to others, and
in particular on the psychological problems caused by the relation between
benefactor and beneficiary. It was traditional to tell the story of the
Academic philosopher Arcesilaus, who had a friend who was poor, but
tried to conceal his poverty. One day when his friend was sick, Arcesilaus
slipped a small purse, which would allow him to provide for his needs,
under his pillow. 15 For the Stoics, benevolence was a part of the " duties"
or actions which were "appropriate " to our human nature. Seneca used a
work by the Stoic Hecaton to compose his treatise On Benefits, in which
he repeatedly affirmed that the benefactor should not consider that the
person receiving his benefits was in his debt. 16
Marcus Aurelius also returns to this theme several times. For him,
however, it represents the opportunity to insist forcefully upon the purity
of intention which must inspire our actions (VII, 73-74; XI, 4) :
When you have done something good, and thus, from another
point of view, you have thus been benefited, why do you look for a
third thing besides these, as idiots do; I mean, besides appearing to
have done good or getting paid back in return?
Nobody gets tired of being benefited. It is beneficial to act in
conformity with nature. Therefore, do not tire of being benefited,
by being beneficial to others.
I did something in the service of the human community; therefore,
I have been beneficial to myself
The Discipline of Action 201
The first reason why we must do good unto others, without asking for
anything in return, is that, by virtue of the principle "what is good for the
whole is good for the part," doing good unto others is the same as doing
good to oneself To this we can add the fact that performing such an
action brings joy: the joy of doing one's duty, but also, and more important,
the joy of feeling that human beings are not only the parts of one
single whole, but the limbs of one single body. If, as Marcus says, you
have not yet understood that you are a member of the body made up of
rational beings (VII, 13, 3),
. . . then you do not yet love human beings from the bottom of
your heart; you do not yet rejoice purely and simply in doing good,
and, moreover, you only do good for appearance's sake, not yet
because you do good to yourself in this way.
Up until this point, it might justifiably be thought that the motivation
of actions performed in the service of the human community is not
entirely pure, for one still expects some usefulness out of it for oneself In
other words, one still hopes to gain from such actions some kind of
happiness, however disinterested it may be. This is the noble Stoic principle
that "virtue is its own reward," which would later be taken up by
Spinoza.17 Nevertheless, one does still speak of a "recompense," and one
is conscious of doing good. Therefore, one runs the risk of watching
oneself do good.
Marcus goes farther in his demands for purity, when, in order to
provide a foundation for the disinterested nature of good actions, he
introduces the notion of natural functions (IX, 42, 1 2):
What more do you want when you have benefited some human
being? Isn't it enough for you to have done something in conformity
with your nature? Do you want to get paid for that? It's as if an
eye were to ask for compensation because it sees, or the feet because
they walk ...
Elsewhere, Marcus tells us that there are three types of benefactor: he
who openly considers the recipient of his benefits as his debtor; he who
only thinks this, and knows that, nevertheless, he did good for the other's
sake; and finally, he who does not know what he has done (V, 6, 3):
He is like a vine which bears grapes and does not seek anything
more, once it has given its own fruit; or like a horse which runs, a
202 THE INNER CITADEL
dog which hunts; or a bee which makes its honey. Thus, the person
who does good does not know it, but he moves on to another
action, as the vine will give its grapes again when the proper season
comes. We must therefore be like those who, in a way, do good
unconsciously.
Here we can see the Stoic notion of " action in conformity with
nature " taking on a new meaning. Each species has an inborn instinct,
given to it by nature, which impels it to act in accordance with its
structure and its constitution: thus it impels the vine to produce grapes,
the horse to run, and the bee to make honey. Thus, every species acts in
accordance with its nature. That which corresponds to instinct within
the human species is the impulse to act (horme); that is, the will and
intention to act in accordance with reason, which defines the human
constitution. Acting in accordance with reason means preferring the
common interest-that of humanity-to one's own interests. Thus, acting
in accordance with reason means acting in conformity with nature.
Just as bees and vines do the work which is proper to bees and vines, so
human beings must do the work which is proper to human beings.
Precisely because doing good is the same thing as acting naturally, however,
good actions must be accomplished spontaneously, purely, and
almost unconsciously. Animal instinct, like a force which never exhausts
itself in its manifestations, somehow transcends all the actions which it
accomplishes, as it passes spontaneously from one action to another; it
does not linger to take pleasure in any specific action. In the same way,
moral intention transcends all the actions which it inspires, and passes
"from one action to the next, "18 without considering these actions as
ends in themselves, without claiming ownership of them, and without
wanting to derive any benefit from them. It therefore remains completely
free with regard to its actions, and it accomplishes them naturally-that
is to say spontaneously, and in a way unconsciously. As Christ
had said: "When you give alms, let your left hand not know what your
right hand is doing. "19
Later, Plotinus20 would affirm that
it is not at all necessary for a brave person to be conscious of the fact
that he is acting courageously and in conformity with the virtue of
courage ... One could even say that consciousness seems to trouble
and weaken the activities and acts of which it is conscious. If these
The Discipline of Action 203
acts are not accompanied by consciousness, it is then that they are
pure, and that they are as intense and as alive as they can be.
Marcus Aurelius' reflections already point in this direction. A genuinely
good action, he says, must be spontaneous and unconsidered, like
animal instinct. It must come without effort, and from one's very being,
for consciousness disturbs the purity of the act. Being conscious of doing
good means to assume an attitude-to take pleasure in such affectation,
and not to devote all one's energy to the act itself
There is a most profound idea behind this criticism of the consciousness
of doing good: goodness cannot be anything other than complete
generosity, without any return upon or complacency in itself It must be
wholly directed toward others. It is perfectly disinterested, inwardly free,
and is not attached to what it is accomplishing.
Marcus, however, is quite aware that such an attitude seems to go
against the Stoic's fundamental disposition of attention to oneself and
acute consciousness of what one is doing. Thus, he introduces an objector
to remind him of this (y, 6, 6) :
It is characteristic of a person acting in the service of the community
to be aware of the fact that he is acting in the service of the community,
and, by God, to want his neighbor to know it too.
Marcus does not, moreover, attempt to resolve the contradiction.
"That is true," he replies, "but you don't understand what I mean."
What Marcus " means" here, in all probability, is that moral life is the art
of reconciling such opposing attitudes as, on the one hand, attention to
oneself and the awareness of duty, and, on the other, spontaneity and
complete disinterestedness.
The freedom of moral intention with regard to the actions it undertakes
is also manifested on the occasion of another problem which crops
up in the discipline of action. We have seen that this discipline requires
that decisions be carefully considered, so that, in theory, nothing could
cause a person to change his mind once he has made his decision. Here
too, however, the agent must not attach himself blindly to his decision to
undertake a given action: he must be able to change his mind, if someone
gives him valid reasons to do so (VIII, 1 6):
Remember that changing your mind and following one who can
lead you back onto the right track is another sign of inner freedom.
204 THE I N NER CITADEL
For such an action is still yours, since it is accomplished in conformity
with your will, your judgment, and, finally, with your intellect.
To reiterate: what matters is not the fact of performing a specific
action, and then to appropriate it as something belonging to us. Rather,
what matters is to conform our intentions to reason and to reasonable
nature. This is equally true when we listen to the advice of a counselor
whose reasons seem to us to be well founded (IV, 12, 2) . The same holds
true if we are not able to accomplish an action by ourselves (VII, 5, 3):
Whatever I do, whether alone or with some other, I must aim at
one single goal: that which is useful to the human community and is
in accord with it.
The " reserve clause " and exercices to prepare oneself to
encounter difficulties
As we have seen, when Marcus discusses the discipline of action, he often
brings up the idea of a "reserve clause." This is particularly true when he
quotes this text from Epictetus (XI, 3 7) which defines the three exercisethemes:

In the exercise-theme which deals with the impulses which lead us
to action, we must never relax our attention, so that these impulses
may be accompanied by a reserve clause, that they may have as their
goal the service of the community, and that they may be proportionate
to value.
This "reserve clause " corresponds to the formula "if nothing prevents
me." That which can prevent an action from being carried out is Destiny,
and therefore the will of universal Nature and Reason, and hence
the will of God or of the gods. The exercise-theme which deals with
impulses and intentions to act thus becomes confused with the exercisetheme
which deals with the desires, since when an obstacle comes up
which prevents an action, the only thing left for us to do is to wish-in
vain-for the act to succeed in spite of everything. Therefore, we must
desire nothing other than what is willed by the All, or universal Nature.
This joyful consent which Marcus demands of us, however, is not easy.
The Discipline of Action 205
We must practice it and prepare ourselves for it; in particular, we must
foresee the difficulties and the setbacks which we will have to confront.
Acting "with a reserve clause" means precisely to prepare oneself for
such setbacks. In the words of Seneca:21
Nothing happens to the sage contrary to his expectations, for he
foresees that something may intervene to prevent what he has
planned from being carried out.
All things happen to him, not according to his wish, but according
to what he has thought. What he thinks above all is that something
can always oppose his plans. But the pain caused by an unsatisfied
desire must be lighter for one who has not promised success to
himself beforehand.
This last sentence shows us that we can distinguish two aspects in the
exercise intended to prepare us for encountering hardships. In the first
place, there is a psychological aspect: blows that are not unexpected, but
foreseen, strike us less hard, and wound us less deeply, than those which
strike unexpectedly. Greek wisdom had long since made this observation.
22 The Stoics had made it a part of their system, and we probably
have an echo of this Stoic theme in the following passage from Philo of
Alexandria:23
They do not bend under the blows of fate, because they have
calculated its attacks in advance. For of the things that happen
against our will, even the most painful are alleviated by foresight.
Then, thought no longer encounters anything unexpected in
events, but the perception of them is dulled, as if it were dealing
with old and worn-out things.
In his ninety-first letter to Lucilius, Seneca imagines in a somewhat
grandiloquent fashion all the wars, earthquakes, fires, mud slides, tidal
waves, volcanic eruptions-in a word, every catastrophe that could possibly
occur. If we leave such rhetoric out of consideration, what Seneca
means is essentially that we must always be ready for everything.
Marcus does not give us such lengthy descriptions of every possible
calamity. He does, however, constantly remind himself of the great law
of nature called universal metamorphosis, or the swift course of the
movement of things. He practices seeing beings and things concretely, in
206 THE I N NER CITADEL
their perpetual movement and transformation. Once, he evokes the vanished
cities of Helice, Pompeii, and Herculanum. Above all, he tries to
place himself within the fundamental disposition of constant vigilance
and readiness for anything that is characteristic of such Stoics as Epictetus
(see III, 24, 86) . Marcus sums up Epictetus' thought in the following
terms (XI, 3 4):
When you kiss your child, you must say to yourself in your mind:
"Perhaps you will be dead tomorrow."
It must be admitted, however, that this kind of exercise is not easy to
practice. Do we not run the risk of being troubled, overwhelmed, and
discouraged by imagining everything that might happen in this way? Is
there not a criticism of this exercise in the following passage?
Don't let yourself be troubled by the representation of your entire
life. Don't try to add up in your mind all the painful difficulties that
are likely to happen, in all their intensity and numbers (VIII, 3 6).
The way to avoid this, Marcus continues, is to concentrate on the present
and the present action, as well as on present difficulties, which are
easier to bear if they are isolated. Is there not a contradiction between the
exercise of concentration on the present, which Marcus is talking about
here, and the exercise which consists in imagining future difficulties?
In fact, what M;ircus is criticizing here is the same thing that Seneca
attacks in several of his letters: the " anguished imagination of the future
";24 that is to say, imagination when it is not controlled by reason. As
Seneca says, "A soul obsessed with the future is miserable indeed; it is
unhappy even before any mishaps. "25
The exercise of preparing oneself for hardships is intended to help us
avoid not only being unhappy during mishaps, but also being "unhappy
before any mishaps." It does this in two ways: in the first place, it makes
us understand that future misfortunes-misfortunes, that is, which are
merely possible--are not misfortunes for us . Second, it reminds us that,
according to Stoic principles, misfortune itself-which may perhaps occur-is
not really a misfortune.
Future misfortunes are not misfortunes. When Marcus writes, "Don't
let yourself be troubled by the representation of your entire life," he is
practicing not only the exercise of concentration on the present, but also
the exercise of foreseeing misfortunes, such as it ought to be practiced.
The Discipline of Action 207
He thinks about future misfortunes, but only in order to add right away
that it does no good to worry about them in advance. This implies that
misfortunes which exist only in the future are not genuine misfortunes:
It is not the past or the future which weigh upon you, but only the
present.
Besides, Marcus knows that if one concentrates on the present, and
circumscribes misfortunes at the moment when they occur, it will be
easier to put up with them one instant at a time. The exercises of
concentration on the present and of preparation for misfortune are thus
intimately linked and mutually complementary.
The evils that we fear are, moreover, not really " evils" in the �toic
sense of the term. The preparation for difficulties and hardships consists
essentially in recollecting the fundamental principles of Stoicism, while
still thinking about the future. The first principle we must recall is that
what we consider an evil is really an event willed by Destiny. Consequently,
it must be resituated within the overall movement of the
Whole, and be given the "physical" definition of which I have spoken.
In other words, apparent evils must not be considered anthropomorphically,
but as natural phenomena.
It is from this perspective that we may interpret the exercise of foreseeing
misfortunes, as we found it in the passage from Epictetus which
Marcus cites: "When you kiss your child, you must say to yourself in
your mind: 'Perhaps you will be dead tomorrow. "' Epictetus continues
by imagining the following dialogue (III, 24, 86-87 = Marcus Aurelius,
XI, 34):
" Those are words of ill omen."
-"They are not ill-omened at all; rather, they are words which
mean nothing other than a natural process. Or would it be 'illomened'
to say that grain will be harvested?"
Marcus himself often returns to this theme; as we have seen, he affirms
that the things which seem unpleasant and painful to us are only the
necessary consequences of natural laws.
Finally, the exercise of preparation consists in remembering the Stoic
dogma that will enable us to understand that whatever difficulties, obstacles,
trials, and sufferings may happen to us are not evils, since they do
not depend upon us and fall outside the realm of morality.
208 THE I N NER CITA D EL
The recollection of Stoic principles is not just for dramatic circumstances,
but is also effective against the difficulties of everyday life (II, 1 ) :
At the break of dawn, say to yourself, "I am going to encounter a
busybody, an ingrate, an insolent person, a crook, an envious person,
and an egotist. All this happens to them from their ignorance of
the distinction between goods and evils."
Marcus then continues by recalling the principles which define good and
evil, but which also define the community among human beings. Since
people participate in the same intellect, and belong to the same divine
race, says Marcus, I cannot suffer any damage at their hands and I cannot
get angry with them.
Here we can see that the exercise of preparation for difficulties-a
kind of examination of conscience in advance-does not concern only
the discipline of desire and the acceptance of the will of Destiny. Rather,
it is an integral part of the discipline of the will and of action. In this latter
case, its function is to motivate a specific type of conduct toward other
human beings. Throughout the Meditations, Marcus Aurelius returns several
times to this exercise, which consists, on the one hand, in expecting
to encounter resistance and ill will on the part of his collaborators and
subjects, and, on the other, in preparing to assume an attitude which is
firm but benevolent, indulgent, and even loving, toward those who
oppose him.
The exercise of rational foresight will not only prevent us from being
"unhappy before mishaps"-that is, victims of a false representation of
future evils-but it will also allow us not to be unhappy in misfortunes,
by means of a twofold process of psychological preparation. First, as we
have seen, we will practice confronting in our minds the future trials
which may happen to us, so that they do not take us by surprise. Second,
we will accustom ourselves to remain inwardly free with regard to what
may be beyond our control in our daily lives. As Epictetus says (IV, I,
I 1 2) :
Begin with the little things: a pot, a cup, and then continue in the
same way as far as a little tunic . . . as far as a piece of land. From
there, move on to yourself, your body, the parts of your body, your
children, your wife, and your brothers .... Purify your judgments
so that nothing which does not belong to you becomes attached to
The Discipline of Action 209
you or becomes as one with you, so that it causes you suffering if it
is torn away from you ... for this is true freedom.
Resignation?
As we have seen, when our action fails or encounters an obstacle, the
Stoics-and Marcus Aurelius the Stoic-seem to tell themselves: "My
intentions were good, and that's what really counts. Destiny has decided
otherwise. I must accept its will and resign myself; the virtue I must
practice now is not justice but the virtue of consent. I must switch from
the exercise of the discipline of action to that of the discipline of desire."
This posed a problem for the Stoics. Marcus does not articulate it
explicitly, but it was very real for him; it might even be called the drama
of his life.
How can we avoid having our consent to the will of universal Nature-that
will which is preventing our action from being accomplished-transformed
into fatalistic resignation and nonchalance? How
can we not be overcome by worry and even by anger, when our collaborators
impede our action or when Destiny-by means of plagues, wars,
earthquakes, or floods-prevents us from achieving the happiness of the
Empire? Above all, what should we concretely do, when the obstacles,
difficulties, and trials which Destiny has willed turn up?
Epictetus had devoted one of his Discourses (II, 5) to the problem:
"How can concern coexist with greatness of soul?" By "greatness of
soul," Epictetus meant "serenity," while by "concern" he meant "being
concerned about acting well." This is the same problem that we are
facing now.
In order to reply to it, Epictetus used a comparison taken from dice
games. It does not depend upon me, he reasoned, that a particular die
should fall. Likewise, the fact that I am in a certain situation, or that
circumstances present an obstacle to my action, does not depend upon
me, but upon Destiny. I must accept my situation with serenity, and
consent to it. In a dice game, however, it does depend on me to play the
die that does fall with concern, care, and skill. Similarly in life: it does
depend on me to use the die which has fallen-that is, the circumstances
of my action such as they have been willed by Destiny-with care,
attention, and skill.
We find this conception of action-at least implicitly-in a passage by
Marcus which has the merit of recapitulating the various situations in
which the Stoic may find himself when he undertakes an action (X, 1 2) :
210 THE I N NER CITADEL
What good is it to suppose, when you can clearly see what must be
done? If you see this, you must travel that path, benevolently, but
without turning around.
Marcus emphasizes that such an energetic, firm, and unshakable decision
must not impede our benevolent dispositions. He repeats this motif in
another passage (VIII, 5, 2) :
Do what the nature of man demands, without turning aside from
the path you have entered upon, in accordance with what seems
most just to you. Only do it with benevolence and discretion,
without any posing.
One can, of course, have doubts about what one ought to do
(X, 12, 1):
If you cannot see what must be done, then suspend your judgment
and use your best advisers.
Obstacles-willed by Destiny-can also arise:
If other things oppose your plan, then keep advancing, and, after
having considered things at length, use whatever resources are available
to you, while holding firmly to that which seems just to you.
The " resources" which we can find in any given situation are the
possibilities which we must be able to exploit in our dice game. They
must, however, be exploited in a rational and thoughtful way, so that
two apparent opposites may be reconciled: the serenity of the sage, who
is not troubled by dramatic situations, but accepts reality for what it is;
and the concern of the man of action, who pursues whatever action he
has undertaken, in spite of all obstacles and difficulties, modifying it in
accordance with circumstances, yet always remaining aware of the goal
which must be his: justice and the service of the human community.
After all, isn't inner peace the surest guarantee of effective action?
Altruism
As we have seen, the discipline of action consists essentially in acting for
the good of the community. Once again, divine action is the model for
human action (V, 3 0):
The Discipline of Action 21I
The Intellect of the All cares about the common good of the All
(koinonikos). This is why it has done the lower things for the sake of
the higher, and has set the higher things in harmony with one
another. See how it has introduced subordination and coordination;
how it has distributed to each thing its portion, in accordance with
its value; and how it has brought the most excellent things together
into a state of mutual concord.
Here the Intellect of the All appears like a good king who watches
over the health of the City. He cares about the well-being of his subjects,
the other rational beings, and places inferior things-that is, animals,
plants, and inanimate things-in their service. He institutes community,
harmony, and concord among rational beings, and distributes goods with
justice. Such an anthropomorphic and "political" representation of the
City of the World should not, however, make us forget that the relationship
between the Intellect and intelligent beings is based upon Nature
herself The City of the World is first and foremost the common City of
rational beings-gods and men-ruled by that law which is at the same
time common and particular to each of these beings. It is also simultaneously
Reason and Nature, since their nature is reasonable. The very
definition of "man" is "rational animal" (VII, I I ) :
For rational animals, action in confonnity with nature is at the same
time in conformity with reason.
The goal of rational animals is to obey Reason and the Law of the
most venerable city (II, 16, 6) .
This most venerable City is the City on high, of which man is the
citizen and " of which the other cities are mere houses" (III, II, 2) .
"What is a man?" Epictetus had asked (II, 5, 26) .
A part of a city. Of the first city, that is, which is made up of gods
and men; then of that which is so called in order to come as close as
possible to it, and which is a tiny image of the whole.
As Emperor, Marcus could not fail to be attentive to such a doctrine,
which placed his entire life in question, as we can see in the following
Meditation, which forms, as it were, his motto or his rule of life (VI,
44, 6) :
2 12 THE I N NER CITA D EL
My City and my Fatherland, insofar as I am an Antonine, is
Rome.
My City and my Fatherland, insofar as I am a man, is the world.
Everything that is useful to these two Cities is, for me, the only
good.
It is, says Marcus (IV, 4, 2) , from the City of the World, or the City on
high, which is the City of reasonable beings, that we receive intelligence,
reason, and law. This equation is not without significance. Intelligence
and reason are common to all reasonable beings; hence they are universal.
This is why they are that common and universal law which is within
all rational beings, for by virtue of their universality which transcends
individuals, they allow us to shift from the egocentric viewpoint of the
individual to the universal perspective of the All. This is why intelligence
and reason tend naturally to envisage the good and the interests of the
Whole. Logikon ("rational") and koinonikon ("caring about the common
welfare ") are inseparable (VII, 5 5) :
Each being must act in conformity with its constitution. By their
constitution, the other beings are made for rational beings ... and
rational beings are made for one another. The primary constituent
in the makeup of human beings is therefore the tendency to act for
the common good.
It has often been held that Stoicism was fundamentally a philosophy of
self-love, since the point of departure both for its physics and for its ethics
is the tendency to self-preservation, and to remain in a state of coherence
with oneself In fact, however, the fundamental tonality of Stoicism is to
a much greater extent the love of the All, for self-preservation and
self-coherence are possible only by virtue of complete adherence to the
Whole of which one is a part. To be a Stoic means to become aware of
the fact that no being is alone, but that we are part of a Whole made up
of the totality of rational beings and that totality which is the Cosmos.
The reason the divine Intellect cares about the common welfare of the
All is that it unfolds itself within this All. It is at the same time itself and
all things, by virtue of a dynamic identity. If it has set in harmony the
beings which participate in the Intellect, this is because all such beings are
parts of it, and all have communion within it. It communicates its intention
to realize the common good of the Whole to all beings, insofar as it
is present within them. Like the Intellect, all rational beings are koi-
The Discipline of Action 2 13
ni5nikoi: that is, they tend naturally to place themselves in the service of
the All, and to ensure the unity of the All.
In a particularly beautiful Meditation, Marcus evokes the great "unities"
which reveal to us the fundamental unity of all things (XII, 3 0):
" The light of the sun is one," even if walls present an obstacle to it. " One
is the common substance, even if it is divided among thousands of bodies
which possess individual qualities." " One is the intelligent soul," even if
it seems to divide itself If there is a force of unity in all things, albeit an
unconscious one, then, by contrast, in the unity constituted by the intelligent
soul-constituted, that is, by all the intelligent souls which participate
in it and which are one with it-there is this particular privilege to
tend consciously "to join that which is akin to it and to unite with it."
"This passion for community knows no obstacles."
Here we can glimpse, beyond the unifying forces which cause bodies
to be held together, a universe of transparency and innerness where
minds tend toward one another in reciprocal community and intimacy.
Rational beings are linked together, insofar as their intention, like that of
the divine Intellect, wills the good of the All; and hence to the extent
that their intentions coincide with the end willed by the divine Intellect.
Such a spiritual universe is thus one of concordant wills. From this point
of view, moral intention becomes an absolute value and a goal in itself,
which transcends all the particular goals to which it may be applied, and
each rational being, insofar as it is free to have this moral intention,
becomes in turn an end for itself and for others. Marcus never tires of
repeating this (see, for example, IX, 1) :
Universal Nature has made rational beings for the sake of one
another.
In a sense, then, it could be said that this community of rational beings
which the divine Intellect unites around itself reminds one of the "kingdom
of ends" discussed by Kant. For Kant, this "kingdom of ends"
corresponds to the community of rational beings, insofar as it is linked
together by the law which each person postulates and accepts for himself
This law prescribes that each rational being must be an end in itself, both
for itself and for others, by virtue of the moral freedom within it.26 It is
because rational beings postulate the moral end for themselves as a law
that they are themselves an end in themselves. As Marcus said, such an
end is to be preferred above all else (XI, 1, 4) :
2 14 THE I N NER CITADEL
It is the property of the rational soul to love its neighbor ... and to
prefer nothing to itself, which is also the property ef the law.
Most people, however, are unaware of this City of the World, and of
Reason. They live in egotism, which is just as pernicious to the City of
the World as it is to the city here below (IX, 23, 2) :
Each of your actions which is not related either distantly or immediately
to an end which serves the common good tears life apart,
and prevents it from being one . It is a seditious act, as when, within
a nation, someone separates his party from the concordant union of
all citizens.
Egotism is harmful not only to the State, but also to the individual.
Egotism isolates him, and as Epictetus had said (II, 5, 26) :
When he is isolated, man will no longer be a man, any more that a
foot would be a genuine foot. For what is man? A part of the
state ...
Marcus Aurelius takes up the same metaphor (VIII, 3 4):
Have you ever seen a lopped-off hand, foot, or head, lying separated
from the rest of the body? That is what one does when he
does not accept what happens, and thereby separates himself from
the All, or who commits any act inspired by egotism. You yourself
have excluded yourself from the unity of Nature, for you had
grown within the Whole like a part, and now you have cut yourself
off from it.
The two disciplines are brought up here: that of desire, implying that
one must accept everything that happens, and that of action, which
prescribes that we act for the common good. It is clear from the passages
quoted above that they both correspond to one and the same attitude:
that of becoming aware that we are only a part of the Whole, and that we
live only by and for the Whole. What other beings do "naturally," man
must do "rationally"; yet in the last analysis this is the same for him as
acting "naturally," since his nature is reason and freedom. Mankind
therefore has the strange power (VIII, 34, 3-5) to be able, by means of his
intentions, his freedom, and his reason, to separate himself from the
The Discipline of Action 2 15
Whole by refusing his consent to what happens, and by acting egotistically.
He thus has the uncanny power, in a sense, to annihilate himself
spiritually. And yet, says Marcus, by means of an even more marvelous
power, mankind can return to the Whole after having cut himself off
from it. He can convert and transform himself, and change from egotism
to altruism.
Action and value; justice and impartiality
In his definition of the discipline of action which is cited by Marcus
Aurelius (XI, 3 7), Epictetus enumerates three characteristics which distinguish
active impulses (hormai), if they are good. First, they must be
accompanied by a "reserve clause," and their goal must be the service of
the common welfare. I have already discussed these first two points.
They must also, says Epictetus, be in accordance with value (kat' axian).
This terminology seems vague and imprecise; are we talking about the
value of the objects upon which our action is exercised, or about the
people affected by such action? Marcus himself often uses the term kat'
axian; in fact it is a terminus technicus, current in the Stoic schools of
Marcus' time. Its meaning was obvious to contemporary initiates, but
today we must try to explain it.
The Stoics had long since developed a rather elaborate theory of
"value. "27 To summarize this doctrine-albeit in simplified form-we
may say that they distinguished three degrees of value. First came those
things which are an integral part of "life according to nature "-that is, of
virtue-for instance, the exercises consisting in the examination of conscience
and in attention to oneself, which contribute to the practice of
moral life. The value of these things was considered to be absolute. In
second place came those things which could help the practice of virtue in
a secondary way. Taken by themselves, these things are neither good nor
bad, but are indifferent with regard to moral good. Possessing them and
exercising them, however, allows us to practice better the virtuous life.
Examples would include health, which makes it possible for us to do our
duty; and wealth, if it allows us to come to the aid of our fellow man.
These second-rank values do not have the absolute value which pertains
only to the moral good, but they can be ranked in hierarchical order
according to the closeness of their relationship to the moral good. Finally,
in last place came those things which, under certain circumstances, could
be useful to virtue. Such things have no value in and of themselves, but
can be exchanged for some good.
216 THE I N NER CITADEL
To recognize the exact value of a thing was thus a very important
exercise, and a part of the discipline of judgment. Not only must we
always try to see each object as it appears in its naked reality, says Marcus
(III, r r, r-2) , but we must also become aware of its place within the
universe, and of
the value it has in relation to the Whole and in relation to mankind,
insofar as mankind is a citizen of the highest City, of which the
other cities are like mere households.
As we have seen, the discipline of judgment is intimately linked to the
discipline of action. Once we have seen the value of things in this way,
we must act in consequence (VIII, 29) :
I see all things as they are, and I use each of them in accordance
with its value (kat' axian).
What Marcus means by this is that, when faced with each event and each
situation, he tries to recognize the benefit he can derive therefrom for his
moral life, and thus to use it in the best possible way (VIII, 43):
What brings me joy is to keep the guiding principle within me
healthy, so that it has no aversion for any human being, nor for
anything that can happen to them, but can look at all things with
benevolent eyes, and know how to receive and to utilize each thing
in accordance with its value.
The discipline of actions thus demands that we be able to recognize
the value of objects, and be able to distribute the intensity of our acts
proportionately. Seneca28 had defined the discipline of action as follows:
in the first place, judge the value of the matter in question; then adjust
our active impulses to this value; finally, bring active impulse and action
into harmony, so that we may always remain in accord with ourselves.
This, then, is the first meaning that can be given to Epictetus' phrase
kat' axian. Yet the consideration of value is not situated only on the level
of individual conduct, but also at the level of social life.
It is here, moreover, that a grave problem arises for the Stoic, for he
does not have the same scale of values as other people. Others attribute
an absolute value to things which, to the Stoics, are indifferent, and
therefore can only have a relative value. Conversely, the Stoic attributes
The Discipline of Action 2 1 7
an absolute value to moral good, which is of no interest to most people.
Marcus seems to allude to this conflict when he writes, a propos of the
topic of helping others (V, 3 6):
Don't let yourself be completely carried away by their representation.29
Instead, help them as far as possible, and in accordance
with the value of the matter at hand. If they incur a loss in the
domain of indifferent things, do not say to yourself that they have
suffered harm, for that is a bad habit.
What is needed is to help others, and therefore also to help them in the
domain of indifferent things, which seem so important to them. Yet we
must still bear in mind the real value of things-their moral finalitywithout
sharing other people's judgments about the value of things. Nor
must we pity them, as if what happens to them were a genuine misfortune.

This is the problem that Marcus faced as Emperor: he had to seek the
happiness of his subjects in the domain of indifferent things, which had
no value in his eyes. Yet by so doing, he would be imitating the divine
example:
The gods help mankind in every possible way: through dreams and
through oracles; and yet it is in order to obtain things which have
value only in the eyes of mankind (IX, 27, 3).
The gods themselves wish the best for mankind, for such is their
goodness that they often help them to obtain health, wealth, and
glory (IX, I I , 2) .
Thus, the gods place themselves within mankind's reach, and provide
them with that which, in itself, has only a very relative value. The same
thing must therefore apply to the Emperor. When defining his attitude to
his fellow human beings-whom Marcus declares to be his relatives and
his associates, even if they do not practice virtue-Marcus declares (III,
I I , 5):
I behave with benevolence and justice toward them, in conformity
with the natural law which founds the human community. At the
same time, however, I share their quest for what has value among
indifferent things.
218 THE I N NER CITA D EL
In addition to one's inner dispositions of benevolence, then, we here
have concrete action, which obliges the Emperor to occupy himself with
things which people consider to be values. In his eyes, too, they can have
a certain value: insofar as they allow for eventual moral progress.
Such, then, is the second meaning we can attribute to the allusion to
axia, or value in Epictetus' definition of the discipline of action.
There is, however, another meaning of the word "value." Here, the
word no longer designates the value of an object, but that of a person,
and it is synonymous with his or her merit. For Marcus, as for the Stoics
in general, justice consists in giving to all people what they deserve
according to their value or merit.30 We cannot, however, assert that this
new sense of the word "value " could also be reconciled with Epictetus'
definition of the discipline of action, as discussed above. Curiously
enough, we find very few allusions to the virtue of justice in the discourses
of Epictetus as recorded by Arrian, and no definition of it. In
Marcus, by contrast, the virtue of justice is so important that it is sometimes
sufficient to define the discipline of action, as for instance in VII,
54: " To conduct oneself with justice with regard to the people present."
Is it because Marcus was conscious of his responsibilities as Emperor
that he attributed such importance to justice? In any event, he alludes to
the definition of this virtue when, speaking about the emperor Antoninus
Pius, his adoptive father, Marcus says (I, r6, 5) that "he distributed
goods to each person, without letting himself be influenced." This means
in particular that he distributed duties and responsibilities without favoritism,
taking into consideration only the individual's merits and value, as
well as his ability to carry out the tasks in question. It certainly also means
that he rendered justice with impartiality.
"Value " and "merit," moreover, do not necessarily mean Stoic moral
value, but can mean either the ability to carry out a specific task, or else,
in judicial matters, guilt or innocence. According to the historian Cassius
Dio, Marcus did not demand perfection of those to whom he entrusted a
miss10n:
If someone did something good, he praised him for it, and he used
him in the task in which he excelled; but he did not take the rest of
his conduct into consideration. He used to say that it was impossible
to create men the way one would like them to be, but that it was
fitting to use men such as they are for the tasks in which they are
useful.31
The Discipline of Action 2 19
The people who have value are those who carry out their "duties"
conscientiously. They are those who, in the domain of political and
everyday life-which is also the domain of indifferent things-do what
needs to be done, even if they do not do it in a Stoic spirit (that is,
considering that the only absolute value is the moral good) .
The model of this justice which distributes goods as a function of
personal merit, without favoritism, and in all impartiality, is divine action.
There is nothing surprising about this, for mankind's moral action
proceeds from his rational nature, which is a part of or an emanation
from divine rational nature. Marcus says of this divine nature (VIII, 7, 2) :
It has no obstacle; it is intelligent and just, since it carries out a
distribution-equal and in accordance with value (kat' axian)-of
time, of substance, of causality, of activity, and of the conjunctions
of events.
One might think that an " equal" distribution cannot be "in accordance
with value "; but we must recall that, since Plato and Aristotle,32
political equality had been a geometrical equality-in other words, it had
been a proportion in which it was fitting to attribute a superior good to a
superior value, and an inferior good to an inferior value. Distribution was
proportionate to arete, which once designated aristocratic nobility, but
which for the Stoics meant nobility of the soul, or virtue. Stoic justice,
then, was aristocratic: not in the sense that it consisted in giving wealth
and power-that is, indifferent things-to the aristocratic class, but in the
sense that it made the consideration of value and of moral responsibility
enter into every decision of political and private life. The historian
Herodian relates that when it came time for Marcus Aurelius to marry off
his daughters, he did not choose patricians or rich personages for them,
but men of virtue. Wealth of the soul, Herodian continues, was, in
Marcus' eyes, the only genuine, proper, and inalienable wealth.33
Divine action, then, is "without obstacle " and "just" because it is
supremely rational, which means that it imposes an order upon itself. In
the first instance, such an order subordinates particular goals to one
unique end: the intention to ensure the good of the Whole. This is why
divine action has no obstacles: because it aims at one thing only throughout
all the particular goals, and knows how to make all the obstacles
which seem to oppose it cooperate toward this unique end. Divine
action also introduces an order and a hierarchy of values among the
particular goals it assigns to itself. Inferior beings-minerals, plants, and
220 THE I N NER CITADEL
animals-are at the service of rational beings, and rational beings themselves
are ends for one another. From the perspective of such a hierarchy
of values, then, divine action distributes time, matter, and causality as a
function of the value of each thing. That is why it is just.
The justice of rational Nature is at the same time the justice of the
Intellect of the Whole (V, 3 0), "which has introduced subordination and
coordination into the Whole," and which "distributes to each its portion,
in accordance with its value." It is, moreover, the justice of the
Nature of the Whole (IX, I, 1 ) , "which has fashioned rational beings for
each other's sake, so that they may help each other mutually, in accordance
with their value and their merit."
Everyday experience could, of course, inspire doubts about such a
divine justice. Indeed, experience seems (IX, I, 6)
to carry out a distribution which is contrary to merit (par' axian) in
the case of good and of evil men, for evil men often live in pleasures,
and obtain the means to do so, while the good encounter only
misery, and that which causes misery.
This, however, is the judgment of people who consider pleasures to be
good, and who do not understand that life and death, pleasure and pain,
glory and obscurity, are neither good nor bad, when what one is searching
for is the moral good. On the contrary, says Marcus (IV, I O) :
Everything that happens, happens in a just way. If you examine this
attentively, you will see that it is true. I am not just saying that "that
happens by way of necessary consequence," but that "that happens
in accordance with justice," just as if it was brought about by someone
who distributed to each his portion, in accordance with his
merit.
In the context of the discipline of desire, we have already caught a
glimpse of the problems posed by the mode of action of Nature or
universal Reason. Did the latter start the cosmic process in motion by
one unique initial impulse, with all things then happening by way of
"necessary consequence"? Or rather, did Nature or Reason pay attention
to each individual, " distributing to each his portion, in accordance with
his merit" (IV, rn)? We saw that, in the final analysis, these two hypotheses
did not exclude each other, since the general law of the universe
somehow assigned to each person the role he or she had to play within
The Discipline of Action 221
the universe. Divine action is a unique action, which seems to adapt itself
marvelously to each particular case. It is, then, as if "it was brought about
by someone who distributed to each his portion, in accordance with his
merit" (IV, r o) . This holds true for the lower beings, which, as Marcus
said (VIII, 7, 2) , receive their portion of duration, substance, and causality
in accordance with their value in the hierarchy of beings. Yet it is still
more true in the case of rational beings. Destiny distributes to each
person that which corresponds to his or her being and value. Each event
is in perfect conformity with the person to whom it happens:
Love only the event which happens to us, and which is linked to us
by Destiny. After all, what could be better suited to us? (VII, 57).
Such-and-such an event happened to you, was coordinated with
you, was set in relation to you, was woven together with you, from
the beginning, starting from the most ancient of causes (V, 8, 12) .
Has something happened to you? Good! Every event that comes
your way has been linked to you by Destiny, and has been woven
together with you, starting from the Whole, since the beginning
(IV, 26, 4) .
Whatever happens to you was prepared for you in advance from all
eternity, and the network of causes has woven together your substance
and the occurrence of this event for all time (X, 5) .
Everything that happens, then, happens in a just way, because everything
that happens to us brings us that which belongs to us and was owed
to us-in other words, that which suits our personal value-and therefore
also contributes to our moral progress. Divine justice is an educator.
The end it aims for is the good of the Whole, as ensured by the wisdom
of reasonable beings.
The Stoic Diogenes of Babylon34 said that, in the definition of justice
as that virtue which gives to each person the portion corresponding to
his or her value, the word "value" (axia) meant "the portion: due to each
person" (to epiballon). The mystery of divine justice shows itself in such
nuances of vocabulary. Marcus Aurelius, for instance, speaks (X, 25) of
"He who administers all things," that is to say, he adds, "who is the Law
(nomos) which distributes (nemon) to each person that which is due to him
(to epiballon). " "What is distributed according to the laws is equal for all"
222 THE I N NER CITADEL
(XII, 3 6, r ) . When, therefore, the divine Law gives to each person the
portion which corresponds to his value, this means at the same time the
portion which is due to that person as a function of his merit and of what
he is, and the portion which falls to his lot or is given to him by fate or
Destiny. It is thus at the same time what people choose to be their own
moral decision, and what the Law, by means of its initial decision, chooses
that they should be. In the same way, the daimon (that is, individual
destiny) , which according to Plato is attached to each soul, is assigned to
it by fate, and yet is chosen by it. 35
Such, then, was the ideal of justice which his Stoic faith proposed to
Marcus, and ifhe could, he would certainly have realized on earth such a
justice which takes only moral value into consideration, which has no
other objective than human moral progress, and for which "indifferent"
things have value only as a function of the assistance they may provide for
moral progress. We shall see that Marcus did not have many illusions
about the possibility of what he ironically called "the realization of
Plato's Republic ."
Such an ideal of justice could, however, inspire an overall inner disposition,
which imitated both the impartiality of universal Reason, which
imposes the same law upon all, and the attentive solicitude of providence,
which seems to adapt itself to each particular case and take care of
each individual, taking into consideration the individual's particular
strengths and weaknesses.
In order to describe this attitude, one might quote a passage from
Louis Lavelle,36 who, without wishing to give an account of Stoic doctrine,
gives quite exact expression to the spirit of justice according to the
Stoics:
There is a sacred indifference: it is that which consists in according
no preference to any of the beings upon our path, but in giving
them our entire presence, and responding with precise faithfulness
to the call they utter to us. This is positive indifference, which is the
converse of negative indifference, with which it is often confused.
Positive indifference only requires us to reserve for all the same
luminous greeting. We must keep the balance between them equal:
may there be in us neither prejudice, nor predilection to cause the
beam to sway. It is then that, in our conduct toward them, we
become capable of introducing the most subtle differences; all the
while giving to each person what he expects, requires, and is fitting
The Discipline of Action 223
for him. Here, the most perfect justice becomes one with the purest
love, and we cannot tell whether it abolishes all choice, or whether
it is everywhere the same loving choice.
We all know that "not making any distinction" is the same thing
as being just; it means applying the same rule to all, without introducing
any exception or favor into our judgment. It is to place
ourselves in the point of view of God, who embraces all beings in
the simplicity of one single glance. Yet this glance is the opposite of
an insensitive glance; it is a loving glance which distinguishes,
within each individual being, precisely what he or she needs: the
words that touch him, and the treatment that he deserves.
Pity, gentleness, and benevolence
In the context of the discipline of judgment, we have seen that although
the Stoics held that the majority of humanity was in an evil state, they
were in this state against their will, simply out of ignorance of the definition
of true good and true evil. This is the great Socratic tradition, which
thus extends, through Plato and Aristotle, as far as Stoicism. "No one is
voluntarily evil. "37 Such Platonic assertions are based upon the Socratic
idea that virtue is a "science "; in other words, that it consists essentially in
knowing, with all one's soul, where the good is and what the true good
is. After all, the human soul naturally desires the good, and spontaneously
tends toward that which seems to it to be good. If it seems to become
evil, this is because it allows itself to be deceived by the appearance of the
good; but it never desires evil for evil's sake. It was all the more easy for
the Stoics to take up this doctrine, in that for them, " everything is a
matter of judgment," and the passions themselves are judgments. In his
treatise On Becoming Aware ef Psychic Defects, 38 the physician Galen gives
excellent expression to this Stoic doctrine: "The principle of many defects
is the false judgment which is brought to bear upon the goal which
ought to be assigned to one's own life."
The great Socratic tradition which runs from Platonism and Stoicism
through Neoplatonism is united by its faith in the eminent dignity of
human nature, which is based on the natural and unconscious desire for
the good which every human being possesses.
Epictetus also fits within this tradition, as he makes an explicit allusion
(I, 28, 4--9) to the teachings of Plato:
224 THE INNER CITADEL
When someone gives his assent to error, know that it was not done
on purpose, for " every soul is deprived of the truth against its will,"
as Plato says. Rather, what was false seemed to him to be the truth.
Epictetus goes on to remark that what corresponds to truth and error in
the area of action is duty and its contrary, as well as the advantageous and
its contrary. We cannot not choose what we think is duty, or what is
advantageous. The mistake is therefore an error, and as long as the soul
has not been shown the error of its ways, it cannot behave otherwise.
Why, then, should we be angry at it?
Shouldn't you rather have pity for those who are blind and mutilated
with regard to what is most important, as we have pity for the
blind and the lame?
This gives Epictetus the opportunity to describe the ideal attitude which
the Stoic must exhibit toward his fellow man (II, 22, 3 6):
With regard to those who are different from him [by the principles
of their life] , he will be patient, gentle, delicate, and forgiving, as he
would toward someone in a state of ignorance, who missed the
mark when it came to the most important things. He will not be
harsh to anyone, for he will have perfectly understood Plato's
words: "Every soul is deprived of the truth against its will."
Following Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius also felt tremendous respect for
the unconscious desire for the truth and the good, which constitutes the
most profound wellspring for mankind's rational nature. Marcus takes
pity on the illness of those souls which, against their will, are deprived of
what they obscurely desire:
"Every soul," says Plato, "is deprived of the truth against its will."
And the same holds true of justice, temperance, benevolence, and
all such virtues. It is therefore absolutely necessary to remind yourself
of this constantly. Thus, you will be more gentle with others
(VII, 63).
If they do not act rightly, it is obviously against their will and out of
ignorance. For "every soul is deprived, against its will, of truth" just
The Discipline of Action 225
as much as of the possibility of behaving toward others in an appropriate
way (XI, 18, 4-5).
Here, Marcus reveals himself as a faithful student of Epictetus. As he
quotes Plato, he does not follow the text of Plato, but instead he repeats
the literal form of the quotation in the deformed state in which it is to be
found in Epictetus. Above all, he draws the same moral consequences
from it.
This ignorance of genuine values in which people are submerged, says
Marcus, is "in a sense, worthy of pity" (II, 13, 3). We will feel this if we
attempt to understand the error in judgment which explains their misdeeds
(VII, 26, 1). "
In a sense, worthy of pity": this qualification is an
allusion to the traditional Stoic critique of pity, which the Stoics considered
a passion. "Pity," said Seneca, 39 "is an illness of the soul produced by
the sight of the suffering of others, or a state of sadness caused by the
misfortunes of others. But no illness affects the soul of the sage, who
always remains serene."
Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus remain faithful to Stoic doctrine, insofar
as what they call "pity" is not a passion or an illness of the soul, but is
instead defined negatively as the lack of anger and hatred toward those
who are ignorant of genuine values. It is not enough, however, to have
pity on people or to be indulgent with them. We must above all try to
help them, by informing them about their error, and teaching them
genuine values (IX, 42, 6) :
In general, it is within your power to instruct the mistaken person
so as to make him change his mind, for whoever commits a misdeed
is a person who misses what he was aiming at, and goes astray.
We must, then, try to reason with the mistaken person (V, 28, 3; VI,
27, 3; VI, 50, 1; IX, 1 1). If we fail in our efforts, then it will be time to
practice patience, forgiveness, and benevolence. Marcus likes to present
our duty toward our fellow men in the form of a dilemma:
People were made for one another; so either instruct them or put
up with them (VIII, 59).
If he is wrong, instruct him to that effect with benevolence, and
show him what he has overlooked. If you do not succeed, then be
mad at yourself; or rather not even at yourself (X, 4) .
226 THE I N NER CITADEL
Epictetus (II, 12, 4; II, 26, 7) had said that we must, like good guides,
set those who have gone astray back on the right track again, without
mocking them or insulting them. If we do not succeed, we must not
make fun of the person who has gone astray, but rather must become
aware of our own inability and accuse ourselves, rather than the person
whom we cannot persuade. As we have just seen, Marcus adds to this
that we must not even be upset with ourselves, for it could be that some
people are incorrigible, and "it is necessary that there be some such
people in the world" (IX, 42, 2) .
Be that as it may, we must try to convert those who go astray and are
ignorant of genuine values. Above all, however, we must do this without
getting angry (VI, 27, 3; V, 28, 3). What is more, we must display an
infinite delicacy. It seems as though Marcus was extremely sensitive to
the tact and gentleness with which souls must be treated, and with which
we must try to change their way of perceiving the world and the things
within it. I must address others
without humiliating them, and without making them feel that I am
merely putting up with them, but with genuineness and goodness
(XI, 13, 2) .
. . . without irony, without humiliation, but with affection, and a
heart free from bitterness; not as one would act in school, nor in
order to be admired by some bystander, but truly one on one, even
if others are present (XI, 18, 1 8).
There is a great wealth of psychological observation in these remarks,
and a remarkable sense of the purity of intention. The paradox of gentleness
is that it ceases to be gentleness if we make an effort to be gentle: any
artifice, affectation, or feeling of superiority will destroy it. Delicacy only
acts insofar as it does not seek to act, with an infinite respect for beings,
and without any shadow of violence, be it only spiritual. Above all, we
must not do violence to ourselves in our attempt to be gentle. Gentleness
must possess an almost physiological spontaneity and sincerity. Marcus
expresses this in a striking way (XI, 1 5), as he satirizes those people who
begin their conversation by saying, "I've decided to be frank with you."
What good are these words? asks Marcus:
If you are sincere, it must be written on your forehead, ring out
instantly in your voice, and shine from your eyes, just as a beloved
person immediately sees his lovers' feelings in their eyes ... The
The Discipline of Action 227
person who is good, without duplicity, and gentle, has these qualities
in his eyes, and everybody can see them.
Even more strikingly, Marcus states that goodness can be sensed when
one approaches a good person, just as, whether one likes it or not, one
immediately smells the odor of someone who smells bad. This pure
gentleness and delicacy have the power to change people's minds, to
convert them, and to make those who are unaware of genuine values
discover them:
Goodness is invincible, if it is sincere, without a phony smile, and
without affectation (XI, 1 8, 1 5).
Far from being a weakness, goodness is a strength:
It is not anger that is manly, but gentleness and delicacy. It is because
they are more human that they are more manly; they possess more
strength, more nerve, and more virility, and this is precisely what is
lacking in the person who gets angry and loses his temper (XI, 18,
21).
What underlies its strength is the fact that gentleness is the expression
of a profound urge of human nature, which seeks harmony between
people. In addition, its strength resides in the fact that it corresponds to
the domination of reason, whereas anger and ill-temper are mere illnesses
of the soul.
In the words of Louis Lavelle,
Gentleness is so far removed from weakness that it alone possesses
genuine strength. . . . All wills become tense when one tries to
defeat or break them; but gentleness can persuade them. Only it can
triumph without a combat, and transform an enemy into a friend. 40
One might say that only gentleness has the power to reveal to people
the good of which they are unaware, although they desire it with all their
being. It acts both by its persuasive force and by the unexpected experience
that encountering it represents for those who know only egotism
and violence. It brings with it a complete reversal of values, by making
those who are its object discover their dignity as human beings, since
they feel themselves to be deeply respected as beings who are ends in
themselves. At the same time, gentleness reveals to them the existence of
228 THE I N NER CITADEL
a disinterested love of the good, which inspires gentleness and which
addresses itself to them.
Despite this, gentleness toward others must not be allowed to exclude
firmness (VI, 50, l):
Try to persuade them, but act even against their will, when that is
required by the rational order of justice.
Here, then, we finally discover a whole new aspect of the discipline of
action: our duty to help our neighbor spiritually, by revealing genuine
values to him, calling attention to his defects, and correcting his false
opinions. To what extent did Marcus really fulfill this role? We do not
know. We can, however, suppose that he attempted to promulgate
around him a Stoic vision of life and of the world. There must be an
allusion to this in the following passage, in which Marcus imagines what
will happen after his death. Someone will say (X, 36, 2) :
Now that that schoolteacher is gone, we can breathe freely.
Granted, he wasn't hard on any of us; but I could feel that he was
criticizing us in silence.
Until now, we have looked only at the first part of the dilemma which
Marcus formulated: " Instruct them." We can now understand this as
follows: " Instruct them with gentleness, and by means of gentleness. "
Now we are in a position to complete the second part of the dilemma
as well: "Put up with them gently." For gentleness is not reserved for
those whom we want to convert, but is also intended for those whose
minds we have not succeeded in changing:
If you can, make them change their minds. If not, remember that it
is precisely for such situations as these that benevolence was given to
you. Besides, the gods themselves are good to such people (IX,
l l, l) .
There is one thing in this world which is of great value: to spend
our life in truth and injustice, all the while remaining benevolent to
liars and to the unjust (VI, 47, 6) .
Do not let those who present an obstacle to you in your progress in
right reason turn you away from healthy action, nor let them succeed
in making you lose your gentleness toward them (XI, 9, l).
The Discipline of Action 229
Liars, unjust people, and all those who persist in error nevertheless
retain-at least in their essence-their rational nature and the unconscious
desire for the good which is inscribed in it. They must therefore
be treated with respect and gentleness:
I cannot be angry with one who is related to me, nor hate him, for
we were made to cooperate (II, I, 3).
Imagine that they are akin to you, that they sin out of ignorance and
against their will (VII, 22, 2) .
It is just as much a sign of weakness to get angry at them as it is to
give up an undertaking you have begun . . . both the man who
allows himself to be frightened, and he who denies the person
whom nature has given him to be a friend and a kinsman, are
equally deserters (XI, 9, 2) .
Such an attitude, based on the idea of the community between rational
beings, finally leads to the doctrine of the love of one's neighbor, which
extends even to those who commit injustices against us.
Loving our neighbors
A proprium of humankind is to love even those who make mistakes.
This will happen if you realize that they are akin to you and that
they sin out of ignorance and against their will (VII, 22, 1-2) .
This transcendence of justice, not only in the direction of pity or indulgence,
but in that of love, was implied by the arguments which invited
the Stoic to reflect, on the one hand, on the indestructible urge which
moves each person toward the good, and, on the other, on the solidarity
which unites all rational creatures together.
Thus, the discipline of action attains its culminating point in the love
of one's neighbor. All the logic of human action tends to reveal that the
prime motive of our activity must be the love of other people, since this
love becomes fused with the deepest urges ofhuman nature (XI, I, 4) :
It is a proprium of the soul, if it is rational, to love its neighbor, which
corresponds both to truth and to respect.
230 THE I N NER CITADEL
The reason for this is that human beings, if they live in accordance
with reason, become keenly aware that they belong to one great body:
that of all rational beings. Insofar as he is part of this All, man is everybody
else, as much as he is himself (VII, 1 3):
As are the limbs of the body in organic unities, such is the relationship
between rational beings, who, although they exist within separate
bodies, are nevertheless constituted in order to realize one
single and harmonious activity.
This concept will impress itself better within you if you often
repeat to yourself I am a limb (melos) of the organism (sustema)
formed by rational beings. But if you only use the letter rho, saying
that you are a part (meros), then you do not yet love mankind from
the bottom of your heart. You do not yet find your joy, without
seeking anything else, in the simple fact of doing good to others.
Moreover, you are acting for the sake of mere appearance, not yet
because when you do good, you are doing good to yourself
This feeling of belonging, and of identification with a kind of "mystical
body" which Kant was to call the kingdom of ends, joins the almost
mystical feeling of belonging to the cosmic Whole. The unity of the
latter, like that of the "body of rational beings," is ensured by the universal
presence of Reason-that is to say, of God himself
The Stoic 's fundamental attitude is thus the love of those realities in
whose presence he is constantly placed by the All, which are intimately
linked to him, and with which he somehow identifies himself (VI, 3 9):
Harmonize yourself with the things to which you are linked by
Destiny.
As for the people to whom you are linked by Destiny: love them,
but genuinely.
For the basis of reality is love . In order to express this idea, Marcus
appeals to the grandiose mythical image of the marriage of Heaven and
Earth (X, 21):
The Earth loves! She loves the rain! And the venerable Ether? It loves
too! The World, too, loves to produce that which must occur. And I
say to the World: I, too, love--along with you. Don't we say:
"such-and-such loves to happen?"
The Discipline of Action 23 1
What fascinates Marcus here is that this mythical image means that
natural processes are, in the last analysis, processes of union and of love.
He notes that language itself seems to express this vision, since in ancient
Greek, in order to designate a thing which habitually occurs or tends to
happen, one says that it "loves" to happen. If things love to happen, we
too must love that they happen.
Thus, the ancient image of the hieros gamos allows us, in a mythic way,
to glimpse the grandiose perspective of the universal love which the parts
of the Whole feel for one another, as well as the comic vision of a
universal attraction which becomes more intense the higher one climbs
on the scale of beings, and the more conscious they become (IX, 9) . The
closer people get to the state of wisdom-in other words, the closer they
approach to God-the more the love which they feel for one anotherfor
all other human beings, as well as for all beings, even the most
humble-grows in depth and in lucidity.
It cannot, then, be said that "loving one's neighbor as oneself" is a
specifically Christian invention. Rather, it could be maintained that the
motivation of Stoic love is the same as that of Christian love. Both
recognize the logos or Reason within each person. Even the love of one's
enemies is not lacking in Stoicism:
When he is beaten, the Cynic [for Epictetus,41 the Cynic is a kind of
heroic Stoic) must love those who beat him.
We have seen Marcus assert that it is proper, and therefore essential, to
human beings to love those who make mistakes. One could say, however,
that the tonality of Christian love is more personalized, since this
love is based on Christ's saying: "What you have done to the least of my
brethren, you have done to me. "42 In the Christian view, the logos is
incarnate in Jes us, and it is Jesus that the Christian sees in his fellow man.
No doubt it was this reference to Jesus which gave Christian love its
strength and its expansion. Nevertheless, Stoicism was also a doctrine of
love. As Seneca43 had said:
No school has more goodness and gentleness; none has more love
for human beings, nor more attention to the common good. The
goal which it assigns to us is to be useful, to help others, and to take
care, not only of ourselves, but of everyone in general and of each
one in particular.

VIRTUE AND J OY
The three virtues and the three disciplines
The Meditations as a whole are thus organized in accordance with a
threefold structure-one could even call it a system-which was developed,
and perhaps invented, by Epictetus. This threefold structure or
system has an internal necessity, in the sense that there can be neither
more nor fewer than three exercise-themes for the philosopher, because
there can be neither more nor fewer than three acts of the soul. The
exercise-themes which correspond to them are related to three forms of
reality: Destiny, the community of rational beings, and the individual's
faculties of judgment and assent. These forms, too, cannot be either more
or fewer in number, and they are respectively the subjects of the three
parts of the system formed by philosophy: physics, ethics, and logic.
What is quite remarkable is that in Marcus Aurelius, we can see
another structure, which had been traditional since at least the time of
Plato, that of the four virtues-prudence, justice, strength, and temperance-take
on, under the influence of this systematic structure, a threefold
structure as well, insofar as Marcus makes the virtues correspond to
each of the disciplines I have mentioned.
The scheme of the four virtues was very ancient. We should recall that
the Greek word arete, which we translate as "virtue," originally had a
quite different meaning from our word "virtue." The term went back to
the aristocratic ethic of archaic Greece, and consequently did not at all
signify a good habit or a principle which leads us to behave well. Rather,
it meant nobility itself, excellence, value, and distinction. We may suppose
that this ideal of excellence and value always remained present in
the mind of the philosophers. For the Stoics, arete is absolute value, based
no longer on warrior nobility, but on the nobility of soul represented by
the purity of our intentions.
Virtue and Joy 233
Since very early times, it seems that there existed a model or a canon
of the four fundamental virtues. In the fifth century B.c., Aeschylus, in
his tragedy The Seven Against Thebes (verse 6rn), enumerates four basic
values when discussing Amphiaraos: he is wise (sophron), just (dikaios),
brave (agathos), and pious (eusebes). Wisdom consists in knowing, with
reserve (aidos), one's place in society and in the world-in other words,
in having a sense of mankind's limits. Justice consists in behaving well in
social life. Bravery, of course, is courage in the face of difficulties, and
especially in combat. Piety, in the case of Amphiaraos, who is a seer,
corresponds to the knowledge of things divine and also human. In the
fourth book of Plato's Republic (427e ff.), there appears a systematization
and justification of this enumeration of the four virtues. Plato distinguishes
three parts of the soul: " reason," "anger" (to thumoeides), which
means that part which urges people on to fight, and " desire " (epithumia).
Three virtues correspond to these three parts of the soul: prudence or
wisdom to reason, courage to anger, and temperance to desire. It is up to
justice to ensure that each part of the soul carries out its function: that
reason is prudent, anger courageous, and desire temperate. The three
parts of the soul, moreover, correspond to the three social classes of the
Republic: reason is the distinctive feature of the philosophers, anger of the
guardians, and desire of the workers. In the State as in the individual,
then, justice will be realized if each class and each part of the soul fulfills
its function perfectly. This systematization, which is linked to a specific
political model, and which makes justice the virtue which contains the
three others, is not to be found in the rest of Plato's dialogues, where the
four virtues are enumerated in various contexts, and without any particular
theorization.1
In their description of moral life, the Stoics also allude to the four
virtues.2 Here, however, they are not subordinate to one another, but are
all on the same level. They mutually imply one another, as do the parts of
philosophy. It is enough to practice one in order to practice them all.
Nevertheless, it is difficult to find in our surviving summaries of Stoic
doctrine the real reason why it is necessary that there be only four
fundamental virtues. The definitions of the various virtues are rather
divergent, but we may note the following: prudence is the science of
what ought and ought not to be done; courage is the science of what
ought and ought not to be tolerated; temperance is the science of
what ought and ought not to be chosen; and justice is the science of what
ought and ought not to be distributed. Unlike Plato, the Stoics do not
appear to link the four virtues to the parts of the soul.
234 THE I N NER CITADEL
From this perspective, it is of great interest to observe the transformations
which the system of three disciplines caused the classification of
virtues in Marcus' Meditations to undergo. Let us begin by noting that the
philosopher-emperor often summarizes the three disciplines-of assent,
of desire, and of action-by making the names of virtues correspond to
them. Thus the discipline of assent takes on the name of the virtue of
"truth"; the discipline of desire acquires the name of the virtue of "temperance
"; and the discipline of action, that of the virtue of "justice." In
itself, the substitution of the notion of "truth" for that of "prudence"
should not surprise us, for Plato had already once (Republic, 487a5) given
the four virtues the names of "truth," "justice," " courage," and "temperance."

The substitution of "truth" for "prudence" can, however, be perfectly
well justified from the perspective of Marcus Aurelius. This is shown by
the following lengthy passage (IX, r ) , which must be cited for two
reasons: first, we can see in it the establishment of an exact correspondence
between the discipline of action and justice, the discipline of assent
and truth, and the discipline of desire and temperance. Second, it offers
an admirable summary of the three exercise-themes.
Justice and the discipline of action
He who commits an injustice commits an impiety. For since universal
Nature has constituted rational animals for the sake of each other, so
that they might help each other in accordance with their respective
merit and never harm each other, he who transgresses the will of
Nature most obviously commits an impiety against the most venerable
of gods.
Truth and the discipline of assent
He who lies, moreover, also commits an impiety toward the same
Goddess. For Universal Nature is the nature of beings; now beings
have a relationship of affinity with true attributes [that is, with what
can be truly said of them] . Moreover, this Goddess is also named
truth, and she is the first cause of all that is true. Therefore, he who
willingly lies commits an impiety, in so far as he commits an injustice
by deceiving. And he who lies involuntarily also commits an
impiety, insofar as he is in disaccord with universal Nature, and he
Virtue and Joy 235
disturbs order insofar as he is in a state of incompatibility with the
Nature of the world. For that person is in a state of incompatibility
who, of his own free will, tends toward that which is contrary to the
truth. He has received from Nature dispositions to know the truth,
but since he has neglected them, he is now no longer capable of
distinguishing the true from the false.
Temperance and the discipline of desire
Finally, the person who pursues pleasures as goods and who flees
pains as evils also commits an impiety. For such a person must
necessarily often reproach universal Nature, for Nature attributes a
particular lot to the bad and to the good, contrary to their merit; for
the bad often live in pleasures and possess that by which they may
procure them, while good people encounter only pain and that
which is its cause. What is more, he who fears pain will one day
come to fear one of the things which must happen in the world, and
this is already impious. Nor will he who pursues pleasures be able to
keep away from injustice; and this is clearly impious. Concerning
things with regard to which universal Nature is equally disposed
(for she would not produce both, if she were not disposed toward
them in an equal way) : with regard to these things, those who wish
to follow Nature, and be in perfect community of sentiments with
her, must also be in a disposition of " equality." Therefore, as far as
pain and pleasure are concerned, death and life, glory and obscurity,
which universal Nature treats in an " equal" manner, he who does
not behave in an " equal" manner obviously commits an impiety.
Here it is easy to recognize the three disciplines: that of action, which
ordains that people should help one another; that of assent, which consists
in distinguishing the true from the false; and that of desire, which
consists in accepting the lot which universal Nature has reserved for us.
To these three disciplines correspond three virtues. In the discipline of
action, we must respect the value hierarchy of people and of things, and
thus act in accordance with justice. According to the discipline of assent,
our discourse must be true, and the virtue particular to this discipline is
truth. He who knowingly lies commits a twofold sin: in the area of assent,
since his discourse is not true, and in the area of action, since he is
committing an injustice with regard to other people. As for the person
THE I N NER CITADEL
who lies involuntarily-in other words, who deceives himself-it is because
he has not succeeded in criticizing his judgments and in becoming
the master of his assent that he is no longer capable of distinguishing the
true from the false. Finally, in the discipline of desire, we must desire
only that which universal Nature wants, and we must not desire pleasures
or flee sufferings. This discipline is characterized by temperance.
Here, then, Nature appears to us in three aspects. She is the principle
of attraction which urges human beings to help one another and to
practice justice, and is therefore the basis of justice. She is also the basis of
truth; that is to say, the principle which founds the order of discourse, and
the necessary relationship which must exist between beings and the true
attributes which are said about them. To speak falsely, whether voluntarily
or involuntarily, is therefore to be in disaccord with the order of the
world. Finally, universal Nature, since she is indifferent to indifferent
things, is the basis of temperance, in other words of that virtue which,
instead of desiring pleasure, wants to consent to the will of universal
Nature.
Marcus here portrays universal Nature as the most ancient and august
of goddesses, in such a way that any lapse with regard to the virtuesjustice,
truth, and temperance-of which this goddess is the model and
the principle, is an impiety. The Stoics traditionally identified God, Nature,
Truth, Destiny, and Zeus. In Marcus' time, there were hymns
which presented Nature as the most ancient of goddesses. For example,
an Orphic hymn3 invokes her in the following terms:
Goddess, mother of all things, celestial mother, very ancient (presbeira)
mother.
A hymn by Mesomedes, one of Hadrian's freedmen, which also dates
from the second century A.D., begins:
Principle and origin of all, very ancient Mother of the world,
Night, Light, and Silence.4
In our long passage from Marcus, we can note a certain tendency to
privilege the importance of justice as compared to the other virtues.
Impiety toward Nature consists in injustice, not only if one refuses to
practice justice toward other human beings, but also if one lies to them,
and even if, involuntarily, one cannot distinguish the true from the false.
For then one destroys the order of Nature, and introduces a discordant
Virtue and Joy 23 7
note into universal harmony. Likewise, if we accuse Nature of injustice
in her distribution oflots among good and evil people, then we ourselves
are committing an injustice. We find a similar idea expressed in XI, I O, 4:
Justice cannot be preserved if we attribute importance to unimportant
things, or if we are easily deceived; if we give our assent too
rapidly, or if we change our mind too often.
To give importance to unimportant things is not to practice the discipline
of desire, and hence to sin against temperance; whereas to be easily
deceived, or to be too rapid or changeable in our judgments, means not
to practice the discipline of assent, and hence to sin against truth.
Truth, justice, and temperance can thus designate the three disciplines,
as in XII, 15:
Whereas the flame of a lamp shines until it goes out, and does not
lose its luster, will the truth, justice, and temperance which are
within you be extinguished before their time?
Elsewhere (XII, 3, 3), the soul's guiding principle, when it frees itself
of everything foreign to it,
does what isjust, wills the events which happen, and tells the truth.
Nothing, says Marcus (VIII, 32, 2) , can prevent us from acting
in accordance with justice, temperance, and prudence.
Sometimes, as in this last example and the following one, we find
some variations in the names of the virtues; yet the tripartite scheme is
retained (III, 9, 2) :
Absence of hurry in judgment, a feeling of kinship toward other
human beings, and obedient consent to the gods.
Alongside this triad of virtues, we sometimes find the traditional
quaternium, adapted and brought into line with the tripartite structure
(III, 6, l) :
THE I N NER CITADEL
If you find something in human life better than justice, truth, temperance,
and bravery ...
In fact, the continuation of this passage reduces these four virtues to
the disciplines of desire and of action (III, 6, r ) , when it becomes apparent
that they consist
in thought which is content with itself (in those things in which it is
possible to act in accordance with right reason) , and which is content
with Destiny (in those things which are allotted to us, independently
of our will) .
The virtues are linked to the functions of the soul: truth and the
intellectual virtues are linked to reason; justice to active impulses; and
temperance to desire. Where, then, can we find a place for courage? It
seems to be shared between temperance, qua strength in adversity and
suffering, and justice, qua active force.
We find no trace of this theory of the virtues in the Discourses of
Epictetus, as reported by Arrian. This does not prove, however, that it
did not exist. As I have said, it was impossible for Arrian to have transmitted
all of the teachings of Epictetus; moreover, the discourses which
he did note down do not correspond to a systematic exposition of the
whole of philosophy.
Be that as it may, a first sketch of this doctrine may be glimpsed well
before Epictetus. In Cicero's treatise On Duties,5 which in its first book
reproduces the teachings of Panaetius, the ancient virtue of prudence
becomes " the knowledge of truth"; justice is based on the social links
between human beings; strength becomes greatness of soul, linked to
scorn for the things which do not depend on us; and temperance submits
our desires to reason. In a way, then, Panaetian strength and temperance
correspond to the discipline of desire in Marcus Aurelius. In the last
analysis such comparisons are rather tenuous, but they do allow us to
glimpse an evolution of the Stoic doctrine of the virtues, which culminates
in the synthesis attested in Marcus.
Joy
In Marcus' view, these three disciplines and virtues bring to the soul the
only true joy which exists in the world, since they place the soul in the
possession of all that is necessary: the one absolute value.
Virtue and Joy 239
Living beings experience joy when they fulfill the function for which
they are made, and act in accordance with their nature. As we have seen,
man fulfills his function qua man, and follows his nature as well as universal
Nature, when he consents to order: the order of the universe as fixed
by Destiny; the order of the City of the World and of human beings,
based as it is upon the mutual attraction of rational beings, and hence on
the proper nature of mankind; and finally to the order of discourse,
which reproduces the relation which Nature has established between
substances and attributes, and above all between events which necessarily
follow upon one another. It is therefore by practicing the three disciplines
that man follows Nature, and finds his joy:
Philosophy wants only that which your nature wants. You, however,
wanted something else, which was not in accordance with
nature. And yet, what is more attractive than what is in conformity
with nature? Is this not how pleasure leads us astray?6 Look and see,
however, if there is anything more attractive than greatness of soul,
freedom, simplicity, benevolence, and piety; for what is more attractive
than wisdom itself? (V, 9, 3-5) .
You must consider the activity which it is possible for you to carry
out in conformity with your own nature as a delight-and that is
always possible for you (X, 33, 2) .
For the person who strives at every moment to live, act, will, and
desire in conformity with his rational nature and with universal Nature,
life is constantly renewed happiness. In the words of Seneca:7 "The effect
of wisdom is a continuous joy ... and only the strong, the just, and the
temperate can possess this joy." Marcus Aurelius often returns to this
theme:
To do what is just with all one's soul, and to tell the truth. What
remains for you to do but enjoy life, linking each good thing to the
next, without leaving the slightest interval between them? (XII,
29, 3).
Enjoy and take your rest in one thing only: to pass from one action
carried out in the service of the human community to another
action accomplished in the service of the human community, together
with the remembrance of God (VI, 7) .
THE I N NER CITADEL
For man, joy consists in doing what is proper to man. What is
proper to man is benevolence toward other human beings, who are
his relatives; disdain for movements based on sense-perception;
criticism of deceptive representations; and the contemplation of
universal Nature, and of that which happens in conformity with its
will (VIII, 26) .
Joy, then, is the sign of an action's perfection. It is only when we love
human beings from the bottom of our hearts, and not merely out of duty,
that we feel pleasure in benefiting them (VII, 13, 3), just because we then
have the feeling of belonging to the same living organism, and of being
the limbs of the body of rational beings.
Unlike Epicurean pleasure, Stoic joy is not the motive and the end of
moral action: rather, virtue is its own reward. Virtue seeks nothing above
and beyond itself; instead, for the Stoics, joy, like Aristotelian pleasure,
comes along as an extra surplus in addition to action in conformity with
nature, "like beauty for those in the flower of youth. "8 In the words of
Seneca:9
Pleasure is not a reward for virtue, nor its cause, but is something
added on to it. Virtue is not chosen because it causes pleasure; but if
it is chosen, it does cause pleasure.
The joy which arises from virtue ... like happiness and tranquillity
... are consequences of the greatest good, but they do not constitute
it. 10
Such joy is not, moreover, an irrational passion, because it is in conformity
with reason. According to the Stoics, it is rather a "good emotion" or
a "good affection."1
1
The joy produced by action accomplished in accordance with Nature
is a participation in Nature's love for the All that she has produced, and
in the mutual love of the parts of the Whole.
For mankind, to be happy means feeling the sentiment of participating
in an ineluctable movement, issuing from the impulse given to the All by
original Reason, in order to realize the good of the All. In the word
physis, which we translate as "nature," the Greeks perceived the idea of a
movement of growth, of unfolding, and, as the Stoics used to say, of
"swelling"12 (emphysesis). To be happy meant to embrace this expansive
Virtue and Joy
movement, and thus to go in the same direction as Nature, and to feel, as
it were, the joy which she herself feels in her creative movement.
This is why Marcus, when he describes joy, uses images which evoke
progress on the right path and in the right direction, and the accord of
our desires, wills, and thoughts with the path of Nature. It is then that
"rational nature follows the path that is proper to it" (VIII, 7, r). The
Stoics13 defined happiness as euroia biou, "the good flowing oflife." Marcus
likes to link this image (II, 5, 3; V, 9, 5; X, 6, 6) to that of "progress in
the right direction"-that is, in the direction of Nature (V, 34, 1). While
the material elements move up, move down, or tum in a circle,
the movement of virtue does not resemble any of these physical
motions, but is something divine, and it proceeds along the right
path, which it is hard for us to imagine (VI, 1 7) .
This right path is the "straight line " or "right road"-that of Nature
herself, whose way is always straight ahead (X, I 1, 4) . Her way is short
and direct (IV, 5 1):
Get to the end of your race in a straight line, following your own
nature and universal Nature, for both of these follow the same way
(V, 3, 2) .
Here, Marcus is reviving an ancient image which had been used by
Plato: 14
The God who, as ancient tradition will have it, holds the beginning,
end, and middle of all things, gets to the end ef his race in a straight line,
in accordance with the order of nature.
Already in Plato, then, the order of nature appears as a triumphant
movement which reaches its end without ever allowing itself to be
distracted from the rectitude of its decision and its intention. According
to Marcus, the movement of the governing part of the soul-the movement
of the intellect-also proceeds in a straight line, like the sun, which
illuminates that which is in its way, and in a sense assimilates it to itself
(VIII, 57). For the Stoics, all moral action reaches its goal straightaway,
insofar as it is its own end, and insofar as it finds its perfection in its very
activity. A propos of this topic, Marcus recalls the technical expression
242 THE I N NER CITADEL
katorthosis, which the Stoics used to designate such actions: it means that
they follow a straight way (V, 1 4).
Joy has its roots in that profound tendency of living beings which
impels them to love that which makes them exist, and this means not
only their own structure and unity, but the All, without which they
would be nothing, and of which they are integral parts. It also means
Nature and her irresistible movement, of which they are but a tiny
moment, but with which they identify themselves wholly, by means of
their moral will.
Finally, and most important, joy is based on the recognition of the
unique value of the one necessary thing that can exist in this human
world: the purity of moral intention. We cannot find
in human life, a good superior to justice, truth, temperance, and
strength (III, 6, 1),
and this, therefore, is the good which we must enjoy (VI, 47, 6) :
Only one thing has value down here: to spend one's life in truth and
justice, all the while remaining benevolent to liars and to the unjust.

M A RCUS AURELIUS IN
HIS MEDITA TIONS
The author and his work
In interpreting the writings of antiquity, and particularly those of Marcus
Aurelius, we must be on our guard against two errors which are diametrically
opposed, but equally anachronistic. One of these, inherited from
Romanticism but still very much alive, consists in believing that an
author expresses himself totally and adequately in the work which he
produces, and that the work is therefore completely in the image and
resemblance of its creator. The other, which is very fashionable today,
holds that the idea of an "author" is passe; the work has its own autonomy
and its own life, and it can be explained without our having to find
out what the author wanted to do or say.
In fact, ancient authors were subject to strict rules, which were not of
their choice. Some of these rules regulated the way in which one should
write; these include the rules of literary genres as defined by rhetoric,
which prescribed in advance the plan of exposition, style, and the various
figures of thought and elocution which must be used. Other rules regulated
the subject matter itself: what was written, the themes with which
the author must deal (which, in the case of the theater, were supplied to
him by mythical or historical tradition) . Philosophers were also situated
within a school-tradition, which imposed upon them a list of questions
and problems to be discussed in a specific order, a method of argumentation
which had to be followed scrupulously, and principles which had to
be adopted.
In the case of Marcus Aurelius, we have seen that the spiritual exercises
which he wrote down were prescribed by the Stoic tradition, and in
particular by the form of Stoicism defined by Epictetus. Canvas, themes,
arguments, and images were provided for him in advance. For Marcus,
the essential thing was not to invent or to compose, but to influence
244 THE I N NER CITADEL
himself and produce an effect upon himself Even if this effect was
efficacious at one moment, however, it would soon lose its strength, and
the exercise would have to be begun again in order constantly to revive
the certitude derived from the striking formulations of the principles and
rules oflife.
This state of affairs will thus lead us to question the attempts of psychological
history, on the basis of the text of the Meditations, to arrive at
conclusions about "the Marcus Aurelius case "-for instance, about his
stomach ailments or his opium addiction.
This does not mean, however, that Marcus is totally absent from the
Meditations, or that any Stoic who happened to be in Marcus' situation
could have written approximately the same work. It is true that the
Meditations attempt, as it were, to eliminate the point of view of individuality,
in order to rise up to the level of universal and impersonal
Reason; yet Marcus the individual still shines through, in this ever-renewed
and never finished effort to assimilate the principles of Reason, in
order to apply them to his particular circumstances. In the last analysis,
this apparently impersonal work is highly personalized. Marcus has a
favorite style and themes; he sometimes has obsessions and lacerating
preoccupations, which arise from his carrying out the business of an
emperor. We know very well what Marcus wanted to accomplish by
writing this work: to act upon himself, place himself in a certain state of
mind, and respond to the concrete problems which the various situations
of daily life posed for him.
The limits of psychological history
The Marcus Aurelius case
What I have said about the "impersonal" nature of ancient works in
general and of Marcus Aurelius' spiritual exercises in particular must
incite us to the greatest prudence in any effort we might be tempted to
make to reconstruct the psychology of the philosopher-emperor. As far
as I know, it was Ernest Renan who was the first to attempt to sketch a
portrait of Marcus. He ended up, moreover, with a portrait that is rather
incoherent. Sometimes, he insists on the emperor's disillusioned serenity:
1
The most solid goodness is that which is based on perfect boredom,
and the clear view of the fact that this whole world is frivolous and
Marcus Aurelius in His Meditations 245
lacking any true substance ... The goodness of the Skeptic is the
most certain, and the pious emperor was more than skeptical. The
movement oflife in this soul was almost as quiet as the tiny noises in
the intimate atmosphere of a coffin. He had attained Buddhist nirvana,
or the peace of Christ. Like Jesus, Shakya-Muni, Socrates, St.
Francis of Assisi, and three or four other sages, he had utterly conquered
death. He could smile at it, because it truly had no more
meaning for him.
Elsewhere, by contrast, Renan discovers in Marcus a tormented soul:2
The desperate effort which was the essence of his philosophy, this
frenzied renunciation, sometimes pushed as far as sophism, finally
conceals an immense wound. One must have said farewell to happiness
to arrive at such excesses! We shall never understand all that
this poor withered heart had suffered, and how much bitterness lay
hidden by his pale visage, always calm and almost smiling.
Here, far from having attained Buddhist nirvana or the peace of Christ,
Renan's Marcus seems " consumed" by an inner sickness:
This strange sickness, this worried study of himself, this demonic
scrupulousness, this feverish perfectionism, are the signs of a nature
less strong than it is distinguished. 3
What he lacked was the kiss of a fairy at his birth, which is, in its
way, a very philosophical thing. What I mean is the art of yielding
to nature: that gaiety which learns that abstine et sustine is not everything,
and that life must also be able to be summed up by the
formula "smile and enjoy. "4
This portrait of Marcus by Renan gave rise to what must be called the
obstinate and tenacious myth which turns Marcus into a disillusioned
pessimist. In the twentieth century-the century of psychology, psychoanalysis,
and suspicion-the Renanian representation of the philosopheremperor
has had a tremendous influence. P. Wendland5 speaks of Marcus'
"mournful resignation." More recently, ]. M. Rist6 has spoken of the
philosopher-emperor's " extreme Skepticism," and of his "penchant for
doubt." Paul Petit7 speaks of a "rather negative despair." What I have said
THE I N NER CITADEL
about the alleged pess1m1sm of the Mediations ought, I think, to be
sufficient to refute such affirmations.
According to E. R. Dodds,8 the emperor considered human activity to
be not only unimportant, but in a way almost unreal. It seems very
difficult to reconcile such an interpretation with what Marcus says about
the discipline of action. Dodds insists on the perpetual self-criticism to
which Marcus subjects himself, and on the need which the emperor feels
to be " another." Dodds relates this tendency to a dream which, according
to Cassius Dio and the Historia Augusta, Marcus had at the age of
seventeen, on the night of his adoption by the emperor Antoninus.
Marcus dreamed that he had ivory shoulders, and this suggests to Dodds
that Marcus suffered from an acute form of what modern psychologists
would call an identity crisis.
Here we have a typical example of the dangers of historical psychology.
Dodds gives a poor definition of what it means to " desire to be
something other than one is." It is true that Marcus aspired to be another
man and to begin another life (X, 8, 3). But as the context shows, what
he means by this is that he wants to acquire truth, prudence, and nobility
of soul (X, 8, r ) . I think that every normal person also desires to be
someone else in that sense, and if that is an identity crisis, then every
person has an identity crisis. I cannot, moreover, see how "so much
self-reproach" presents a "morbid" aspect, as Dodds maintains.9 On this
theme, Dodds attributes to Marcus the formula " It is difficult for a man
to put up with himself, " which, we are to believe, lets us infer either that
Marcus wz.s unbearable to himself, or that, more generally, human nature
taken in itself is unbearable to itself. In fact, however, Dodds completely
deforms the meaning of Marcus' text 0/, IO, 4; not V, IO, I as is incorrectly
indicated in Dodds's note) . Marcus' actual tone is the following:
Also consider the ways of life of the men who live with you; the
most pleasant of them is difficult to put up with, not to say that he
can scarcely put up with himself.
Thus, the issue is not at all Marcus' relationship with his own self, but
a wholly other problem, to which I shall return. Neither is this Marcus'
personal experience; rather, it is a description, traditional within Stoicism
and even within the other schools, of the misery of a person who does
not live as a philosopher, does not devote himself to the unique value of
the moral good, and who is therefore in contradiction and at war with
himself. To live philosophically-that is to say, to live " according to
Marcus Aurelius in His Meditations 247
nature "-is to be coherent with oneself In all this, no "identity crisis"
on the part of Marcus can be discerned.
Moreover, when discussing Marcus' dream, Dodds does not give a
complete report of what the ancient historians had to say. The Historia
Augusta, 10 for example, tells us that not only did the young man dream
that he had ivory shoulders, but that he wondered if they would be able
to support a burden, whereupon he discovered that they were extraordinarily
stronger. Cassius Dio, 11 writing shortly after Marcus' death, specifies
that in his dream, Marcus could use these shoulders just as easily as
the other parts of his body. In fact, however, the question is not what
such a dream might represent to a person of modem times, but what it
may have meant to a person of antiquity. The mistake made by some
kinds of psychological history is to project back onto the past our modem-day
representations, according to which shoulders which are " other"
must correspond to "another" man. What we must try to understand is
what the images which appeared to the people of antiquity in their
dreams could represent within their collective mentality. As Pierre Grimal12
has shown, for them ivory shoulders immediately brought to mind
the story of Pelops. Pelops' body, tom to pieces by his father Tantalus,
had been served to the gods for dinner. Demeter, still grieving over the
death of her daughter Persephone, was the only one not to recognize the
dish, and she ate Pelops' shoulder. Clotho, goddess of Fate, replaced it
with an ivory shoulder and revived the young Pelops. According to the
Images by Philostratus, who wrote a few decades after the death of Marcus,
Poseidon was dazzled by the sight of this ivory shoulder, and he fell
in love with Pelops. "When the night covered the earth, the young man
was illuminated by his shoulder, which shone like the evening star in the
midst of the darkness. "13
To have ivory shoulders was thus to be the object of divine solicitude
and grace; it was to be protected by Fate, as personified by Clotho. In the
situation of increased responsibility announced by his adoption, the ivory
shoulders announce the help from the gods and from Fate which will
make Marcus strong enough to assume his task. This, for a man of
antiquity, is the true meaning of Marcus' dream.
The psychosomaticist R. Dailly and H. van Effenterre have undertaken
collaborative research in order to diagnose what they call "the
Marcus Aurelius Case. "14 In particular, they sought to know the reason
why, in a kind of contradiction with his principles, this emperor surrounded
himself with highly dubious characters. He chose as co-ruler his
adoptive brother, Lucius Verus; he entrusted the position of Commander
THE I N NER CITADEL
in Chief over the entire East to Avidius Cassius, the general who later
took up arms against him; and finally, he chose as his successor in the
imperial dignity his son Commodus, who was to become a tyrant comparable
to Nero. "These were three fine male specimens," write the
authors of this article, "who had a definite ability to enchant the crowds;
and we are entitled to wonder whether they did not also exert a kind of
unconscious fascination upon Marcus Aurelius." Thus, right at the beginning
of the article, we encounter the thesis which the two authors
mean to defend: the philosopher-emperor was a weak man, lacking in
virility, who felt the need to compensate for his doubts and hesitations by
surrounding himself with strong, self-confident men. Here we can
glimpse the inner workings of this kind of psychological explanation:
people believe they have uncovered a highly characteristic symptom,
which is not in fact the symptom of anything, since it is not even a
symptom. Nothing proves that Marcus chose these individuals out of
attraction toward their virile force. The elections of Lucius Verus,
Avidius Cassius, and Commodus were dictated by complex political
reasons, which historians have analyzed thoroughly. Nor is there anything
to prove that these "fine male specimens" (were they indeed so
fine?) were really so sure of themselves. Since, however, the subject of
this book is the Meditations, I do not wish to allow myself to be dragged
into the domain of history. I wish simply to affirm, most firmly, that the
Meditations do not, either in their goal or in their content, permit us
either to affirm or to deny that Marcus was a weak man, that he lacked
virility, or, as our two authors would have it, that he had a stomach ulcer.
They arrive at this last diagnosis on the basis of the following passage
from the historian Cassius Dio:15
[During the Danubian campaign] , he became physically very weak,
to the point that, at the beginning, he could not stand the cold, and
after the soldiers had been assembled on his order, he had to retire
before having spoken to them .... For it was not his custom to eat
anything during the day, with the exception of the medicine called
theriac. He took this not because he was afraid of anything, but
because his stomach and his chest were in poor shape. And it is said
that it was because of this medicine that he was able to resist this
illness, and others as well.
This text makes no mention of any chronic illness, but rather refers to
Marcus' state during the Danubian campaign. Elsewhere, Cassius Dio
Marcus Aurelius in His Meditations 249
bears witness to the fact that the Emperor was vigorous in his youth, and
that he took part in violent sports like hunting.16 According to Dio, it
was the worries of his office and his ascetic ways that weakened his body.
Be that as it may, our two authors, after having diagnosed a gastric ulcer,
move on to the psychological correlates of this illness:
The ulcerous man ... is he who is essentially withdrawn into himself,
worried and preoccupied ... His neighbors are masked from
him by a kind of hypertrophy of the self: it is himself, in the last
analysis, that he seeks in others ... Conscientious to the point of
minutiae, he is more interested in the technical perfection of administration
than in those human relations of which administration
should be only the sum total. Ifhe is a thinking man, he will incline
to seek for justifications, to compose superior personalities, and to
adopt Stoic or Pharisaic attitudes. In the area of ethics, he will be
virtuous by effort, good by application, and a believer by force of
will.17
I am not qualified to debate the scientific value of the psychological
portrait which these two authors trace of these "gastropaths," although it
would be interesting to ask them if they recognized themselves in this
dark portrait. What I question is the possibility of deriving from the
Meditations even the slightest hint which might confirm or invalidate this
description of Marcus Aurelius' psychology. The authors are completely
mistaken as to the nature of this work when, to justify their diagnosis,
they claim that the Meditations respond to a need for "justification in his
own eyes," and constitute "a long series of exhortations to persist in the
path chosen beforehand." As we have seen, the Meditations do not represent
an exceptional phenomenon, proper to Marcus. Such written meditation
was highly recommended by Stoic masters, and is, moreover, still
practiced today by people who do not have a stomach ulcer, but who are
simply trying to live in a somewhat human way. And this is not a case of
self-justification, but rather of an attempt at self-criticism and self-transformation.
These variations on themes supplied by Epictetus cannot
inform us about the Emperor's gastric ulcer, and can tell us nothing
decisive about the Marcus Aurelius " case." Here we have a good example
of the dangers of psychological history when applied to ancient texts.
Before we present the interpretation of a text, we should first begin to
distinguish between, on the one hand, the traditional-one might almost
say "prefabricated"-elements used by the author, and, on the other,
250 THE I N NER CITADEL
what he or she wishes to do with them. If we do not make this distinction,
we will consider as symptomatic formulas or attitudes which are not
at all such, because they do not emanate from the author's personality but
are imposed upon him by tradition. We must try to find out what the
author wants to say, but also what he can or cannot say, and what he must
or must not say, as a function of the traditions and the circumstances
imposed upon him.
Was Marcus an opium addict?
This is what T. W. Africa should have investigated, before he claimed to
discover the symptoms of Marcus' alleged opium addiction in the Meditations.

Africa bases his claim on three pieces of evidence. He takes up the
passage from Cassius Dio discussed above, which, while describing the
Emperor's state of health during the winter campaigns on the Danube,
told us that he did not consume anything during the day except an
antidote called theriac. He did this not because he was afraid of being
poisoned, as we saw, but in order to calm his chest and stomach. Elsewhere,
Africa mentions a work by Galen entitled On Antidotes, which
describes the different ways of preparing theriac, the usefulness of this
medicine, and the way in which Marcus used it. Finally, Africa thinks he
can discover visions and psychic states produced by opium abuse within
the Meditations.
Here is how Africa summarizes the evidence of Galen18 on Marcus'
theriac consumption:
When he found himself getting drowsy at his duties, he had the
poppy juice removed [from the mixture] ... But, then, he was
unable to sleep at night .... So he was obliged once again to have
recourse to the compound which contained poppy juice, since this
was now habitual with him.
If we read Galen's text19 through to the end, however, we find that it
says precisely the opposite of what Africa wants to make it say. In the
continuation of his text, Galen specifies two things. In the first place,
when Marcus took up the mixture containing poppy juice again, his
personal physician, Demetrius, made sure that it contained aged poppy
juice, which did not have the same soporific effect. Second, after the
death of Demetrius, Galen himself was responsible for preparing the
Marcus Aurelius in His Meditations 251
Emperor's theriac, and he is quite proud to be able to say that Marcus
was completely satisfied with the way he composed the antidote in
accordance with the recipe that was traditional among the physicians to
the emperors. Thus, according to Galen, the Emperor's sleepiness was
only a temporary accident which happened during the Danubian campaigns,
and which did not happen again after aged poppy juice was used,
and especially after Galen intervened. That is what the latter's text actually
says.
In fact, the question is exceedingly complex, and we have no way of
determining the exact quantity and quality of the opium juice that went
into the theriac which the Emperor consumed. On the one hand, his
doctors took care to see that the opium juice was aged and weakened.
On the other hand, Galen, in the course of his treatise, speaks of three
kinds of antidotes which he had prepared for Marcus Aurelius: galene (the
antidote of Andromachus) , which contained sixty-four ingredients, one
of which was poppy juice; theriac of Hera, which contained no poppy
juice, but had equal parts of bituminous clover, Aristolochia rotunda,
mountain rue (Ruta halepensis), and ground vetch (Vicia Ervilia). Finally,
there was an antidote consisting of one hundred ingredients, which contained
very little poppy juice. Thus, the quantity of poppy juice was
highly variable.20
For his part, Galen saw a proof of Marcus' wisdom in this custom of
his:
Some people use this medicine every day, for the good of their
body, as we know personally from the case of the divine Marcus
who once ruled in respect of the laws, and who, thanks to the
consciousness he had of himself, observed the mixture of his body
with very precise attention. He used this medicine copiously, as if it
were nourishment. It was from him that theriac began to be famous,
and that its powerful effectiveness appeared among men.
Indeed, thanks to the fact that the Emperor's health improved because
of it, people's confidence in the usefulness of this medicine
increased considerably. 21
Thus, we can see from this body of evidence, taken from Cassius Dio
and from Galen, that nothing in any way allows us to infer that Marcus
was an opium addict.
This, moreover, is the conclusion which T. W. Africa himself
reaches,22 in a footnote to his article: "Admittedly the amounts of opium
252 THE I N NER CITA D EL
could vary, and, on the basis of the antidote of the younger Antimachus
(Galen XIV 42) , a kyamos (Marcus' daily dose) would contain about
0.033 gram of opium, hardly sufficient for addiction."
In that case, however, can we still speak of an opium addiction? Yes,
says Africa, because Marcus displays two symptoms: his "odd detachment
from domestic realities," and the "bizarre visions" which we find in the
Meditations. The strange detachment mentioned by Africa is probablyfor
he never clarifies the point-what historians have always censured
Marcus for: his apparent indifference to the infidelities of his wife
Faustina and to the extravagances of his colleague Lucius Verus, as well as
the unfortunate choice he made of Commodus as his successor. As we
have already seen, however, the question with regard to Lucius Verus
and Commodus is very complex, and political motives must have played
a large role in determining Marcus' attitude. As for Faustina: she bore
Marcus thirteen children, and he mentions her briefly but very emotionally
in the first book of the Meditations. Everything leads us to believe that
she was the victim of court gossip. Be that as it may, it is difficult to see
why Marcus' attitude was any more a symptom of opium addiction, as
Africa maintains, than it was of a stomach ulcer, as Dailly and van Effenterre
had thought.
There remain the "bizarre visions." Here, bad historical psychology
reaches one of its summits; this is a piece worthy of an anthology. I quote
T. W. Africa:23
Marcus' vision of time as a raging river carrying all before it into the
abyss of the future was no school doctrine of life viewed from the
Porch, but an attempt to express the extended perspectives of time
and space which opium had opened up to him. Temporal and
spatial dimensions were accelerated until Europe was but a speck
and the present a point and men insects crawling on a clod. History
was no longer a reference but an actual pageant of the past. Marcus
shared the exacerbated sensations of his fellow opium-addict De
Quincey:24 "The sense of space, and, in the end, the sense of time,
were both powerfully affected. Buildings, landscapes, etc., were
exhibited in proportions so vast as the bodily eye is not fitted to
receive them. Space swelled and was amplified, to an extent of
unutterable infinity. This, however, did not disturb me so much as
the vast expansion of time; I sometimes seemed to have lived for 70
or I oo years in one night; nay, sometimes had feelings representative
Marcus Aurelius in His Meditations 253
of a millennium passed in that time, or, however, of a duration far
beyond the limits of any human experience."
Let us now examine the passages from Marcus Aurelius to which
Africa refers in a footnote:
A river of events, a violent current: that is what eternity is. No
sooner has one thing been seen than it has already passed; another
one passes, and will, in its turn, be swept away (IV, 43).
Think often about the rapidity with which beings and events pass
and disappear: for substance is like a river in perpetual flux; activities
are in constant transformation; and causes are in a myriad of modes.
Almost nothing is stable, even that which is close to you. Think also
of the infinite abyss of the past and of the future, into which everything
is swallowed up (V, 23) .
Pace Mr. Africa, this theme is well attested in Stoicism, for instance in
Seneca:25
Represent to yourself (propane) the vastness of time and embrace the
universe, and then compare what we call human life to this immensity.

Time passes with infinite speed .... Everything falls into the same
abyss .... Our existence is a point, or less; but nature, by dividing
this minimal thing, has given it the appearance of a longer duration.
We find this ancient image in the following fine verses by Leonidas of
Tarentum:26
Infinite, 0 man, is the time before you came to the dawn; infinite is
that which awaits you in Hades. What portion of existence remains
to you, if it is not barely the value of a point, or still less?
Marcus' river is no doubt the Stoic river of substance, "which flows
ceaselessly, "27 but in the last analysis it is the river of Heraclitus-that
Heraclitus who Plato said compared beings to the flow of a river.28 It is
also the river of the Platonists, mentioned by Plutarch: "Everything
appears and disappears in one unique moment; be it actions, words, or
2 54 THE I N NER CITA D EL
feelings; like a river, time sweeps everything away. "29 Finally, we also
encounter this river in Ovid: " Time flows in perpetual movement; like a
river, wave is pressed by wave. "30
When Seneca uses the expression propane, which means "represent to
yourself" or "place before your eyes the bottomless chasm of time," he
emphasizes that he is speaking of an exercise of the imagination, which
the Stoic must practice. We find an exercise of the same kind in those
Meditations in which Marcus seeks to embrace the dimensions of the
universe by his imagination, or to see things from on high, in order to
reduce them to their true value:
Remember the totality of substance, of which you participate in
only the smallest portion; remember also the whole of eternity, of
which you have been assigned but a brief, tiny interval. Finally,
remember destiny, of which you are a part: but how tiny! (V, 24)
If you suddenly found yourself transported into the air, and contemplated
human affairs and their variety from above, you would
have contempt for them, as you saw, in the same glance, how vast is
the domain of the inhabitants of the air and of the ether (XII, 24, 3).
You can cut off many of the superfluous things which present
obstacles to you, and which rest entirely on your value-judgment.
Thus you will clear for yourself a vast open field, by embracing the
entire universe in your mind; you will comprehend perpetual eternity,
as you consider the rapid transformation of each individual
thing. How short is the time from birth to dissolution; how gaping
is the infinity before birth, and similarly the infinity after dissolution
(IX, 3 2).
The soul traverses the entire world and the void which surrounds it;
it examines the form of the world; extends itself into the infinity of
eternity, and embraces and conceives the periodic rebirth of the
universe (XI, I, 3).
Asia and Europe are corners of the world; the entire sea is a drop of
the world; Athas is a lump of earth in the world; all of present time
is a point in eternity; everything is tiny, fragile, and evanescent (VI,
36, 1).
Marcus Aurelius in His Meditations 255
We can immediately see the difference between these passages and
those by De Quincey. For the latter, the distention of duration and space
is an impression imposed upon the addict from outside, and he is in a
sense its passive victim. For Marcus, by contrast, the consideration of the
infinity of time and space is an active maneuver, as we can see from his
frequent admonitions to "represent to himself" or to "think" the totality.
Here again, we are in the presence of a traditional spiritual exercise,
which utilizes the faculties of the imagination. Moreover, De Quincey
speaks of a distention of the instant, which takes on outlandish proportions;
whereas Marcus speaks of an effort to imagine the Infinite in its
totality, in order subsequently to see the instant, or the place, reduced to
infinitesimal proportions. This voluntary exercise of the imagination presupposes
that Marcus adhered to the classical representation of the Stoic
universe: the universe is situated within an infinite void, and its duration
within an infinite time, within which the periodic rebirths of the universe
repeat themselves eternally. This exercise is intended to obtain a
vision of human affairs which resituates them within the perspective of
universal Nature.
A procedure such as this is the very essence of philosophy. Thus we
find it, always identical beneath the diversity of vocabularies, in all the
philosophical schools of antiquity. Plato defined the philosophical nature
by its ability to contemplate the totality of time and of being, and therefore
to hold human affairs in contempt.31 We find this theme again
among such Platonists as Philo32 or Maxim us of Tyre, 33 in
Neopythagoreanism,34 among the Stoics,35 and even among the Epicureans.
Representative of the last-named is the following saying by Metrodorus:

Remember that, although you were born mortal and with a limited
life, you have nevertheless, by means of discussions about nature,
risen up to the eternity and infinity of things. You have also seen the
future and the past.36
In Cicero's famous Dream of Scipio, 37 the grandson of Scipio Africanus
contemplates the world from the heights of the Milky Way. He sees the
earth so small that the Roman Empire seems imperceptible to him; the
inhabited portion of the world seems like a tiny island in the middle of
Ocean; and life seems to be less than a point. This theme was to remain
very much alive throughout the Western tradition. We have an echo of
it in Pascal's "two infinites":38 " Let the earth appear to him as a point,
THE I N NER CITADEL
compared to the vast circle described by this star ... " Was Pascal, then,
also an opium addict?
Marcus also transports this view from above onto the past (X, 27) :
Think constantly about this: how all events which are similar to
those which are happening now, have also happened in the past;
and think that they will happen again. Place entire dramas, and
homogeneous scenes, which you know through your personal experience
or through ancient history, before your eyes: for instance,
all of Hadrian's court; or that of Antoninus; the whole courts of
Philip, Alexander, or Croesus. For all of that was similar; only the
actors were different.
T. W. Africa has read De Quincey, and has noticed the fine page in
which the latter evokes the reveries in which there appeared to him the
luminous spectacle of the ladies of the court of King Charles I, or Paulus
Aemilius, surrounded by centurions, striding in front of the Roman
legions. Africa believes he finds an analogous phenomenon in Marcus
Aurelius. Once again, however, it is enough to read Marcus attentively
to recognize the difference. De Quincey's description is purely oneiric:
the dream is told for its own sake, as a strange and marvelous spectacle.
For Marcus, however, it is not a dream: the Emperor demands an imaginative
effort from himself, in order to try to represent to himself the
courts of the past. As Paul Rabbow has shown,39 this practice is carried
out in accordance with the rules which rhetoric prescribed when one
had to depict a scene or a circumstance in an expressive way. Moreover,
the picture was not there for its own sake, but only in order to provide a
highly austere conviction in the soul of the person practicing the exercise;
namely, that human affairs are banal and ephemeral (VII, 49) :
Behold the past. So many changes of regime; and the future can be
predicted equally well. Things will be entirely homogeneous, and
we cannot escape the rhythm of what is happening now. That is
why there is no difference between studying human life for forty
years, or ten thousand years, or more: what more could one possibly
see?
I believe I have sufficiently demonstrated the workings of a certain
type of historical psychology. Generally speaking, it is based upon igno-
Marcus Aurelius in His Meditations 257
ranee of the modes of thought and composition of ancient authors, and it
anachronistically projects modern representations back upon ancient
texts. It would, moreover, be interesting to psychologize some historical
psychologists; I believe we could discover in them two tendencies. One
is iconoclastic : it takes pleasure in attacking such figures as Plotinus or
Marcus Aurelius, for example, who are naively respected by right-thinking
people. The other is reductionist: it considers that all elevation of the
soul or of thought, all moral heroism, and all grandiose views of the
universe can only be morbid and abnormal. Everything has to be explained
by sex or drugs.
Stylistic elegance
From everything that has just been said, we must not conclude that
Marcus is absent from his Meditations. Rather, he is present in them in
many ways, and the work has an autobiographical value which is limited,
but very real.
First and foremost, Marcus is present by virtue of his stylistic elegance.
We have already seen that the Emperor, who was writing for himself,
usually makes an effort to write with the greatest care, certainly because
he is aware of the psychological power of a well-turned phrase. The
procedures Marcus uses have been well analyzed by]. Dalfen, 40 Monique
Alexandre,41 and R. B. Rutherford,42 who have also pointed out the
felicitous expressions in which they result. As Monique Alexandre has
shown, Marcus here reveals himself to be a true student of Fronto. It
appears that Fronto required his student to compose a saying (gnome)
every day, and above all to formulate it in different ways. As Fronto
writes,43 "Each time you conceive of a paradoxical thought, turn it over
within yourself, vary it with diverse figures and nuances, make trial of it,
and dress it in splendid words." Throughout this book, we have been
able to admire Marcus' skill at developing multiple variations on the
same theme. Fronto also advised his student to make collections of sayings
for himself 44
It is difficult to add anything new to the remarkable studies that have
been carried out on Marcus' style. I think, however, that it may be useful
to cite some examples of the quest for stylistic elegance which appears in
some passages from his work.
The quest for conciseness often gives such passages a remarkable vigor,
and an almost enigmatic character:
THE I N NER CITADEL
Correct, not corrected! (VII, 1 2).
Grow on the same trunk, but don't profess the same doctrines! (XI,
8, 6: the opposition is between homothamnein and homodogmatein) .
Neither an actor nor a whore! (V, 28, 4) .
For the stone thrown up in the air, it is neither bad to fall back
down, nor good to rise up (IX, 17).
Receive without pride, let go without attachment (VIII, 3 3).
Men have come into being for one another; so either teach them or
put up with them (VIII, 59) .
Leave the fault of another right where it is (IX, 20) .
A bitter cucumber? Throw it away! Brambles on the road? Avoid
them! (VIII, 50) .
We have already frequently encountered the brutal, explosive formulas
which Marcus uses to describe the ugliness of life when it is bereft of
moral value:
A mime (mimos) and a war (polemos); excitement (ptoia) and numbness
(narka); the slavery (douleia) of every day! (X, 9) .
Note the assonances in this last passage, which are indicative of Marcus'
search for literary effect.
In how short a time, ashes or a skeleton! A mere name, or no longer
even a name. But a name is nothing but meaningless noise, or an
echo.
And everything to which people attach so much importance in
this life is empty, rotten, and petty: little dogs that nip at one another;
kids who fight, laugh, and then suddenly burst into tears.
Faith, however, and Modesty, Justice, and Truth "have taken flight
toward Olympus, fleeing the road-furrowed earth" (V, 33) .45
The most striking fommlas deal with the brevity oflife, death, and the
vanity of fame:
Marcus Aurelius in His Meditations 259
Soon, you will have forgotten everything! Soon, everyone will have
forgotten you! (VII, 21).
Everything is ephemeral; both that which remembers, and that
which is remembered (IV, 3 5).
Soon you too will close your eyes, and someone else will have wept
for the person who laid you to rest (X, 34, 6) .
Yesterday, a bit of phlegm; tomorrow, ashes or a mummy (IV,
48, 3).
Marcus not only had a knack for turning concise phrases, but he also
knew how to tell of the beauty of things in few words, as in a passage
from the Meditations (III, 2) cited earlier. There, Marcus evoked crusty
bread and ripe figs which split, and maturity, which is already almost
rottenness, which gives its beauty to the color of olives, and which also
gives a kind of flourishing to elderly men and women, and makes heavyladen
ears of com lean toward the earth. The "lion's wrinkled brow," the
"foam dripping from the boar's muzzle," and the "gaping jaws of wild
beasts" also have their own savage beauty.
Fronto had taught his imperial student to introduce images and comparisons
into his sayings and discourses, and Marcus learned his lesson
well:
On the same altar, there are many grains ofincense. One falls before
the others, another later. What difference does it make? (IV, 1 5).
Dig within. That's where you'll find the source of the good, and it
can always burst forth anew, if you keep digging (VII, 59).
A spider hunts down a fly, and thinks he is pretty hot stuff. One
man hunts down a little hare; another catches a sardine in his net;
another hunts boars, another bears, another Sarmatians. Aren't they
all thieves, if you examine the motives of their actions? (X, 1 0).
Have you ever seen a hand which has been cut off, or a foot, or a
severed head lying somewhere apart from the rest of the body? That
is what a person does to himself . . . who does not wish for what
happens, and who separates himself from the All ... (VIII, 3 4).
260 THE I N NER CITADEL
In certain Meditations, we also notice a striving after rhythm and the
harmonious balance of phrases, as for instance in the following prayer to
the World:
Everything which is in accord with you is in accord with me, 0
World! Nothing of what comes in an opportune way for you comes
either too soon or too late for me! All that your seasons produce, 0
Nature, is fruit for me (IV, 23) .
Elsewhere, a thought is developed in parallel and ascending formulas,
as in the following passage, of which I will cite only the beginning:
One is the light of the sun, even if it is divided by walls, mountains,
or a thousand other things.
One is the common substance, even if it is divided into thousands
of bodies, each with its own individual qualities.
One is the soul, even if it be divided into thousands of faculties of
growth and individual differences.
One is the thinking soul, even if it seems divided ... (XII, 3 0).
In these stylistic exercises, to which Marcus accorded all his attention,
one may, I believe, glimpse two characteristic features of his personality:
a great aesthetic sensitivity and an intense search for perfection.
It may be of interest to point out that W. Williams46 has carried out a
study of the style of Marcus' constitutions, and therefore of the juridical
texts which he wrote. According to this author, we can note in these
writings a meticulousness highly concentrated upon details, and an almost
exaggerated insistence on explaining points that are self-evident.
This seems to indicate a certain lack of confidence in the moral and
intellectual qualities of his subordinates, and a quest for purity in the use
of Greek and of Latin. Finally, it shows the scrupulous attention that
Marcus devoted to finding the most equitable, humane, and just solutions
possible.
Chronological signposts
The reader of a literary work always likes to know at what moment of
the author's life it was written, and in what atmosphere. To be sure,
there is something atemporal about the Meditations, and it must be admitted
that the attempts made by various historians to attach certain passages
Marcus Aurelius in His Meditations
to specific moments of the Emperor's life have been disappointing. As
we have seen, the Meditations are spiritual exercises, carried out upon a
canvas prefabricated by the Stoic tradition, which did not leave any room
for personal anecdotes. In order to suggest a date for their composition,
we possess only two pieces of objective evidence. Between what is now
Book I and what is now Book II of the Meditations, the editio princeps
contains a sentence which can be translated as follows: "Written in the
land of the Quadi, on the banks of the Gran, I." Between what is now
Book II and what is now Book III, it contains the indication "Written in
Camutum." It may have been the Emperor himself who added these
two specifications, as he made for himself a classification of the notes he
had written.
Camutum was a military base which the Romans had established
starting at the beginning of the first century B.c. on the Danube, not far
from Vienna, and it was home for several thousand legionnaires. A small
town had sprung up near the camp, with an amphitheater which was
built in the second century. It was there that Marcus established his
headquarters during his wars against the Quadi and the Marcomanni,
from 1 70 to 1 73.
The river Gran is still called either by this name or by that of the Hron;
it flows from north to south through Slovakia, and joins the Danube in
Hungary. Marcus' allusion to this river is invaluable: it reveals to us that
the Emperor was not content to direct operations from the fortified
camp at Camutum, but that he had crossed the Danube and had penetrated
the territory of the Quadi-a Germanic people who, together
with the Marcomanni, had invaded the Empire in 1 69-tO a distance of
more than 60 miles.
To what books of the Meditations do these two notations refer? The
allusion to the Quadi is placed between Books I and II, whereas the
mention of Camutum comes between Books II and III. In antiquity,
indications of this kind could appear either at the beginning or at the end
of a book. If these two notes were placed at the end, then the first one
refers to Book I, and the second to Book II. If they were placed at the
beginning, then the first one refers to Book II, and the second to
Book III. Historians have adopted both views, without ever furnishing
decisive proo£ I am inclined to follow G. Breithaupt47 and W. Theiler48
in thinking that these indications were placed at the beginnings of Books
II and III respectively.
It is most interesting, and even moving, to note that at least a part of
the Meditations was written during the Roman operations carried out on
THE I N NER CITA D EL
the Danube in 1 70-1 73-not only in the relative calm of a military
headquarters, but amidst the discomfort of an expedition into the land of
the Quadi. This situation may explain the distinctive tone of Books II
and III: the haunting presence of the theme of death. There is no more
time to read; it's not the moment to wander. I find it easy to believe that
this warlike atmosphere explains the decision Marcus seems to make in
Book II to concentrate on the practice of those spiritual exercises which
would help him finally to live the philosophical life which he should
have lived, and would have liked to live, all throughout his life.
Although I have no proof, I suspect that the manuscript which was
copied by the editio princeps contained other indications of this kind,
which were omitted by the editor. Thus, we do not know where the
other books were composed. Are we to suppose, with Breithaupt,49 that
the books which deal with the court and with speeches to the Senate
were written between November 1 76 and August 1 78, after Marcus had
returned to Rome? But already at Carnutum, Marcus could very well
have thought in a general way about his life as an emperor. It is very
likely that Books IV to XII were written between 1 73 and 1 80, when
Marcus died.
Let us return to the indication placed between Books I and II: "Written
in the land of the Quadi, on the banks of the Gran, I." How can we
explain the number I, if this indication refers to Book II? What is now
Book I, in which Marcus, in a style wholly different from that of the
Meditations properly so called (Books II-XII) evokes all that he has received
from men and from the gods, seems to be a text in its own right,
which has its own unity, and which was placed at the beginning of the
Meditations, if not by Marcus himself, then at least by an ancient editor.
Thus, what is now Book II was in fact the first book of the Meditations
properly so called. 50 This would explain the number I after the indication
"Written in the land of the Quadi"; it must have been introduced by an
editor or a secretary who had numbered the various groups of notes
which Marcus had written.
Moreover, it is legitimate to suppose-although it cannot be proved
with certainty-that what is now Book I was written very late in the
Emperor's life. This book gives the impression that it speaks only of
people who have died. Since the Empress Faustina, who is mentioned in
these pages,51 died in 1 76, it seems that this book was written between
1 76 and 1 80. Perhaps it was written at Rome between 1 76 and 178, after
the revolt of Avidius Cassius, when Marcus returned from his great
eastern voyage; or perhaps it was at Sirmium, Marcus' headquarters from
Marcus Aurelius in His Meditations
1 78 to 1 80, when war with the Germans broke out again. It was probably
at Sirmium that Marcus died, on March 1 7, 1 80. The present-day
Book I, which has a marked unity with regard both to its style and to its
overall structure, seems alien to the literary project of the Meditations
properly so called (Books II-XII) . It is now located at the beginning like
a kind of introduction, but it is really more of a parallel work; it is
obviously related to the Meditations (in Book VI, 30, for example, we can
discern an initial sketch of the portrait of Antoninus Pius) , but it represents
a wholly different psychic disposition. Book I is a prayer of thanksgiving,
whereas Books II to XII are a meditation on the Stoic dogmas
and rule oflife. These latter books were composed on a day-to-day basis,
with each thought following without any connection to the previous
thought; whereas Book I was written at a precise moment, and in accordance
with a precise plan.
Books II-XII
As discussed previously, it is not certain whether the twelve books as we
have them today corresponded to twelve groups of meditations which,
in the eyes of their author, had their own unity, defined by one or more
dominant themes. In that case, they would allow us to glimpse something
of Marcus' personal preoccupations, or of what he happened to be
reading. Or is this grouping into twelve books purely accidental, perhaps
a result of the form and dimensions of the writing materials that were
used? Book I obviously represents a coherent whole in itself; it responds
to a very particular intention and is independent from the eleven other
books. What can we say about Books II-XII?
At first glance, the divisions between these groups of meditations seem
purely arbitrary. The same themes and expressions are repeated throughout
them. The tripartite structure of the disciplines which I have described
has no influence on the work's literary form; instead, it is repeated
in the most varied forms. A precise plan cannot be discerned in
any of these books, with the possible exception of Book III, which turns
out to be a kind of series of essays on the theme of the good man.
Nevertheless, a close examination allows us to discover some characteristics
which are peculiar to each of these books: favorite themes,
special vocabularies, the greater or lesser frequency of the literary forms
that are used-whether they are sayings, for example, or rather short
dissertations. We are justified in supposing that if Marcus wrote his
Meditations on a day-to-day basis, and probably during the last years of his
THE INNER CITA D EL
life, then certain spiritual preoccupations or readings may have
influenced him in different ways at different moments in the process of
composition.
The preferred themes in a given book often appear by means of a
process that I would call "interwoven composition." Marcus does not
gather together one after the other those meditations which deal with the
same subject; instead-probably on a day-to-day basis-he interweaves
them with other thoughts which deal with entirely different subjects. In
other words, after an interruption, which may be very brief, he returns to
the theme which, for the time being, has retained his attention.
Throughout a given book, then, one or more precise themes reappear
intermittently, like a leitmotif
Books II and III are very close to each other. Within them, death is
sensed as imminent (II, 2; II, 5; II, 6; II, l l; II, 12; II, 14; II, 1 7), and
there is no more time to distract oneself by reading (II, 2; 3). Marcus
decides not to write anything more which does not contribute to the
transformation of his moral life and to his meditation on Stoic doctrines
(III, 1 4). It is urgent that he change his life, especially since he has
received so many reprieves from the gods (II, 14). Only one thing
counts: philosophy (II, 17, 3), which consists of the three disciplines.
First, it means keeping the guiding principle of the soul (hegemonikon; II,
2, 4) , or-another way of expressing the same thing-the soul (II, 6) or
else the inner daimon (II, 1 7, 4; II, 13, 2) , free from the slavery of false
thoughts (II, 2, 4) . This is the discipline of thought or judgment. Second,
the soul must be kept pure of all irritation against events, and accept the
portion which has been attributed to it by destiny (II, 2, 4; II, 16, l-2; II,
1 7, 4) ; this is the discipline of desire. Finally, it must be kept pure of all
egoistic action, or actions which are undertaken lightly or without a goal
(II, 2, 4; II, 1 7; 4) ; this is the discipline of action.
Book III takes up exactly the same themes. We find in it the same
atmosphere of the imminence of death, and Marcus' decision to devote
himself exclusively to spiritual exercises intended to transform moral life:
Cease your wandering. Don't read your little notebooks any more
(III, 1 4).
We also re-encounter the description of the one thing necessary, and the
only thing that counts in such an urgent situation: to maintain the purity
of one's daimon or guiding principle, in the areas of thought, desire, and
action.
Marcus Aurelius in His Meditations
It is very interesting, however, to observe how Book III attempts to
present these themes from Book II in a much more developed and
elaborate way, so that Book III is essentially made up of a series of short
dissertations which are all on the same topic: the description of the " good
man" as an ideal for life, and the enumeration of those precepts which
permit the realization of such an ideal (III, 9-1 1). An initial attempt is
presented in III, 4 (in about forty lines) , then briefly taken up again in
III, 5 (for about ten lines) , and then finally set forth abundantly once
again in III, 6-8 (in about forty lines) . The "good man, " who has preferred
his inner daimon in every circumstance, and is in some way its
priest and its servant, attains the supreme level of human happiness,
which consists in acting in accordance with right reason (III, 7, 2) .
Books IV-XII are rather different from the two preceding books. First
of all, even if we do sometimes find short dissertations of the same kind as
those in Book III, especially in Books V, X, and XI, the majority of
meditations in these books appear in the form of short, striking sayings.
Marcus himself seems to theorize about this literary genre when he
mentions the "spiritual retreat into himself, " which consists precisely in
the act of concentrating on "short and fundamental" sayings which can
dissipate all grief and irritation (IV, 3, 1-3).
Some themes from Books II-III are still present in Book IV: for
instance, the theme of the imminence of death and the ideal of the "good
man" (IV, 1 7; c£ IV, 25; 3 7):
Don't live as if you were going to live for ten thousand years. The
inevitable is hanging over you. As long as you are still alive, and as
long at it is still possible, become a good man.
As in the previous books, this sense of urgency does not allow Marcus to
waste his time by concerning himself with what others do or say (IV, 1 8);
rather, one must hasten toward the goal by the shortest path possible (IV,
18; 5 1).
The notion of the daimon disappears almost completely in the later
books, and reappears in the Meditations only sporadically (V, I O, 6; V, 27;
VIII, 45, 1; X, 13, 2; XII, 3, 4) . By contrast, new themes, which will be
found throughout all the following books, make their appearance. For
example, we find the dilemma "Providence or atoms" (IV, 3, 6) , which I
have already discussed at some length.
In Book V, the themes which had dominated Books II and III disappear
or become blurred once and for all. In particular, although death is
266 THE I N NER CITA D EL
sometimes still mentioned as a possibility which might compromise our
efforts toward perfection, it is now also present as a liberation for which
we must wait with patience and confidence; for it will deliver us from a
human world in which moral life-the only thing that counts, and the
only value--is constantly frustrated (V, I O, 6; V, 33, 5).
In another new theme, Marcus exhorts himself to examine his conscience
(V, I I ) :
Toward which goal am I using my soul in this moment? Ask myself
this question in every circumstance ...
Similarly, he wonders (V, 3 I ) how he has behaved with regard to the
gods, his family, his teachers, his friends, and his slaves. Here we recognize
the domain of " duties" (kathekonta), which are the subject of the
discipline of action. Marcus continues by sketching a kind of balance
sheet of his life (V, 31, 2) , which, as in V, IO, 6 and V, 33, 5, gives us to
understand that he can wait for death with serenity, since he has had
everything he could expect from life.
One particular notion, to which Book II had made only a brief allusion
(II, 9) , is amply and frequently developed in Book V: the distinction
between universal Nature and " my" own nature. As we have seen, this
distinction is the basis of the opposition between the discipline of desire,
which consists in consenting to the fact that I "suffer" owing to the
action of universal Nature, and the discipline of action, which consists in
" acting" by virtue of my own rational nature (V, 3, 2; V, IO, 6; V, 25, 2;
V, 27) :
In this very moment, I have what common Nature wants me to
have at this moment, and at this moment I am doing what my own
nature wants me to do at this moment (V, 25, 2) .
As Marcus says, the road that these two natures follow is, in fact, the
same (V, 3, 2); it is the straightest and shortest road. It is here, moreover,
that the notion of the daimon briefly reappears, and it is extremely interesting
to observe an identification and an opposition between the
" outer" god, who is universal Nature or Reason, and the "inner" godthe
daimon or hegemonikon-who emanates from it (V, IO, 6) :
Nothing will happen to me which is not in conformity with the
Nature of the All. It depends on me to do nothing which is contrary
to my god and my daimon.
Marcus Aurelius in His Meditations
This is why moral life can be defined as "a life with the gods" (V, 27) :
He lives with the gods who constantly shows them a soul which
greets what has been allotted to it with joy, and, at the same time,
does everything wanted by that daimon which Zeus [i.e., universal
Nature] has given to each person as a watchman and a guide, and
which is a parcel detached from himself This is nothing other than
the intellect and reason of each of us.
This theme of the two natures is found in other books (VI, 58; VII, 55, l;
XI, 13, 4; XII, 3 2 , 3 ) , but never as frequently as in Book V.
Other themes also seem to be characteristic of Book V. For example, it
contains two allusions to a Stoic cosmological doctrine which Marcus
mentions very rarely: that of the eternal return. Usually, Marcus imagines
the metamorphoses of things and the destiny of souls within the "period"
of the world in which we are now living, without worrying about the
eternal return of this period. This is what he does first, in V, 13, where he
begins by affirming that each part of the universe, as it is born and dies, is
transformed into another part of the universe. Yet he remarks:
There is nothing to prevent one from talking like this, even if the
world is administered in accordance with determinate periods.
In this case, he means, all the parts of the universe will be reabsorbed at
the end of each period into the original Fire-Reason, before they are
reborn from this same Fire in the following period. Elsewhere, in V, 32,
we get a glimpse of the immensity of the space that opens up before the
soul which "knows"-that is, which accepts Stoic doctrine:
It knows the beginning and the end, and the Reason which traverses
universal substance, and which administers the All throughout
eternity, in accordance with determinate periods.
We do not find another allusion to the eternal return until XI, l, 3.
Finally, an important autobiographical theme also makes its appearance
in Book V: the opposition, which constitutes a serious personal
problem for Marcus, between the court at which he is obliged to live,
and philosophy, to which he would like to devote himself entirely (V, 16,
2) . This theme will be taken up again in Book VI (12, 2) , and in Book
VIII (9) .
The first meditations of Book VI present a good example of the
268 THE I N NER CITADEL
"interwoven composition" of which I have been speaking. Chapter l
deals with the Stoic doctrine that explains the constitution of reality by
the opposition between the matter of the world-which is docile and
ready for any and all transformations, and in which there is therefore no
evil-and the "Reason which guides it," in which there is similarly no
place for evil. After three very short meditations, which have no connection
with this problem, Marcus returns (VI, 5) to the theme of the
beginning: the action which the "Reason which guides" exerts upon
matter. The expression "Reason which guides/ governs" ( dioikon logos),
which is attested in VI, l and 5, is not found elsewhere in the Meditations,
with the exception of a quotation from Heraclitus in IV, 46, 3. One
could say that it is as if this book's first meditations were inspired by a
reading which dealt with the goodness of that Reason which governs
matter.
Some personal features also appear in Book VI. For instance, Marcus
mentions (VI, 26) his own name, Antoninus, which he received after
having been adopted by Antoninus Pius. He also makes a distinction
within himself, as it were, between "Antoninus," the Emperor whose
city is Rome, and the "man," whose city is the World (VI, 44, 6) .
Marcus takes up this distinction between Emperor and man again in VI,
3 0, and he advises himself not to "become Caesarized," or let the imperial
purple rub off on the man. He then turns to the model which
Antoninus Pius, his adoptive father, had represented for him. Advising
himself to "Do everything as a disciple of Antoninus," Marcus describes
some of the qualities he admired in Antoninus, which may guide him in
his way of governing and living.
Even more than Book VI, Book VII gives a number of examples of
"interwoven composition." Marcus returns to a few favorite, recurrent
themes, which, although they are present in other books as well, reappear
with regularity from one end of Book VII to the other, separated
from each other only by a few meditations which deal with other subjects.
Thus, he repeats several times that we have the power to criticize
and to modify the value-judgments which we apply to things (VII, 2, 2;
VII, 14; VII, 1 6; VII, 1 7, 2; VII, 68) ; that things are subject to rapid and
universal metamorphosis (VII, rn; VII, 1 8; VII, 19; VII, 23; VII, 25); that
it is vain to seek for fame and glory (VII, 6; VII, r n; VII, 21; VII, 62) .
Marcus also speaks of how we are to behave and the principles we must
recall when someone has committed a fault against us (VII, 22; VII, 26) ;
and finally, he exalts the excellence and the supremacy of moral life (that
is to say, of the three disciplines) , by comparison with all other qualities
(VII, 52; VII, 66-67; VII, 72) .
Marcus Aurelius in His Meditations
Chapters 3 l to 5 l are extremely interesting because they seem to have
preserved for us traces of the notebooks Marcus wrote for himself These
quotations from various authors-Democritus (VII, 3 l, 4), Plato (VII,
35; VII, 44-46) , Antisthenes, and Euripides (VII, 3 8-42; VII, 50-51)­
are probably secondhand. For example, Marcus probably read the following
quote from Antisthenes, "To do good and yet to have a bad
reputation is something which kings can expect," in the Discourses of
Epictetus as recorded by Arrian (see IV, 6, 20) . It was all the more likely
to attract Marcus' attention in that it may have seemed to him to reflect
his own experience. The quotations from Euripides, for their part, frequently
appeared in collections of sayings. In another book (XI, 6) ,
Marcus composes a brief history of the dramatic art, alluding successively
to tragedy, old comedy, and new comedy. In the context of tragedy,
Marcus notes that tragedians gave useful moral lessons, and he quotes the
same three texts from Euripides-in which the Stoics recognized their
own doctrine-which we find in chapters 38, 40, and 41 of Book VII:
If the gods have abandoned me, as well as my children, there is a
reason for that as well.
We must not become angry with things, for it is not their fault.
To harvest life like a swollen ear of grain; one exists; the other is no
more.
" Interwoven composition" is also used quite abundantly in Book VIII;
I shall give only one very typical example. Book VIII marks the reappearance
of a theme that we have already encountered: the short, straight
path which is proper to nature. Rational human nature follows its path
and heads straight for its goal if it practices the three disciplines (VIII, 7) .
In this book, however, the theme takes on a nuance which it did not
have in the others: now Marcus speaks of the rectilinear movement not
only of nature, but also of the intellect. Moreover, instead of describing
the movement proper to the intellect on one occasion, Marcus returns to
it three times in different chapters, and these occurrences are separated by
meditations which are unrelated to this subject. He first touches on the
theme in chapter 54, where he urges himself to breathe the intellect
which embraces all things as if it were the surrounding air: for the power
of the intellect, he writes, is diff used everywhere, like the air which beings
breathe. Then come two chapters-55 and 56-which are unrelated to
this theme. The theme reappears in chapter 57, where the movement of
THE I N NER CITA D EL
the intellect is no longer compared to that of the air, but to that of the
light of the sun, which, says Marcus, is diff used everywhere and extends in a
straight line as it illuminates the objects it encounters, thus somehow
assimilating them to itself Then come two other chapters, which deal
with entirely different themes. In chapter 60, we return to our familiar
theme: here the movement of the intellect is compared to that of an
arrow. Like an arrow, the intellect moves in a straight line toward its goal
when it advances prudently and takes the trouble to examine things
attentively. Chapter 54 spoke only of the divine intellect in which we
participate, whereas chapters 57 and 60 describe the movement of our
intellect as it imitates the divine intellect. It is hard to imagine that
Marcus would have thus returned three times to a very specific theme
unless he had been under the influence of a particular reading, or at least
of a momentary preoccupation. Be that as it may, chapters 54, 57, and 60
are intimately linked to one another.
In Book VIII, the theme of universal metamorphosis takes on a very
particular form. Here, Nature has the power to use the detritus which
results from its vital activity to create new beings (VIII, 50). Since it has
no space outside itself where it can throw this detritus, it transforms it
within itself and makes it into its matter once again (VIII, 1 8). Intellectual
or rational nature, for its part, transforms the obstacles that oppose its
activity into a subject for exercises, which thereby permits it to attain its
goal by using that which resists it (VIII, 7, 2; VIII, 32; VIII, 35; VIII, 41;
VIII, 47; VIII, 54; VIII, 57).
We can note a few autobiographical allusions in Book VIII, such as life
at court (VIII, 9) and speeches before the Senate (VIII, 3 0). Figures of the
dead who were close to Marcus are evoked: his mother (VIII, 25) and his
adoptive brother (VIII, 3 7). Encouragements to examine his conscience,
which had already occurred in Book V, reappear several times (VIII, 1-2)
and are linked to the theme of the imminence of death (VIII, i; VIII, 8;
VIII, 22, 2) .
Although Book IX, like Books IV, VI, VII, and VIII, is composed for
the most part of brief sayings, it does contain five rather long expositions,
which vary in length from about thirty to forty lines, and which have
either no parallels in the rest of Marcus' works, or at the very least few
parallels. In IX, 1, Marcus demonstrates rigorously that the lapses one
commits in the three disciplines of action, thought, and desire constitute
faults of impiety and injustice with regard to Nature, the most venerable
of deities. In IX, 3, we find an exposition on the theme of death: not
only does Marcus expect and wait for the dissolution of the body, but, as
Marcus Aurelius in His Meditations
in Book V, this dissolution is perceived as a liberation. When Marcus
speaks of the fatigue produced by discord in communal life (IX, 3, 8) ,
and prays for death to come as soon as possible, we can perhaps detect an
autobiographical trait; I shall return to this point later. In IX, 9, reason
establishes that the higher up one rises in the hierarchy of beings, the
more mutual attraction is increased. In IX, 40, the problem of prayer is
examined. Finally, in IX, 42, we find a collection of considerations
intended as a remedy for the temptation of anger.
Book IX may also contain some further autobiographical allusions: for
example, the rapid evocation of Marcus' childhood (IX, 21); a possible
allusion to the plague which was then ravaging the Empire (IX, 2, 4) ; and
above all a highly important reflection on the art of governing (IX, 29) .
Book IX also has its own peculiarities of vocabulary. Nowhere else,
for instance, does Marcus use the expression ektos aitia (" outer cause ") to
designate the causality of Fate and of universal Nature (IX, 6; IX, 3 1).
In the entirely different context of the relations between oneself and
others, Book IX is the only one to mention the paradigm of the gods,
who, despite the faults of mankind, maintain their benevolence toward
humans and help them in the area of things which, to the Stoics, are
indifferent and have no moral value, such as health and glory, for example
(IX, I I ; IX, 27) . The Emperor, too, will consequently also have to be
attentive to those human desires which are not in conformity with philosophy.

Book IX likes to insist upon the necessity of "penetrating into the
guiding principle of other people's souls," in order to understand the
motives which make them act in a certain way, and therefore excuse
them (IX, 18; IX, 22; IX, 27; IX, 34).
In Book X, the number of longer expositions (from thirty to one
hundred lines) clearly increases, and we find far fewer examples of "interwoven
composition." One should note, however, the recurrence of
the theme of a realistic vision of other people (X, 13; 1 9). In order to
judge people in accordance with their true value, we must observe them
or imagine them when they eat, sleep, make love, and relieve themselves.

When Marcus evokes the picture of people whispering around a sickbed-which
could be his own-we get the impression that the Emperor
is sharing a confidence with us when he makes them say: "At last that
schoolmaster is going to let us breathe!"
Book X is the only one to use the word theoretikon. It occurs in X, 9,
2, where the importance of the theoretic foundations of action is affirmed;
272 THE I N NER CITADEL
and again in X, l l, I, where Marcus exhorts himself to acquire a theoretic
method, in order to practice the spiritual exercise which consists in
recognizing the universal metamorphosis of all things; in other words,
this exercise must be based upon solid, well-assimilated dogmas. It is also
only in Book X that reason and the intellect, which take all events as
food for their moral life, are compared to a healthy stomach, which
assimilates to itself all kinds of food (X, 3 I, 6; X, 3 5, 3).
Book XI can be divided into two parts: there are the first twenty-one
chapters, and then there are the final eighteen, which are a collection of
quotations and notes jotted down in the course of Marcus' readings,
comparable to the similar group which we encountered in the middle of
Book VII. Why is it here? It is impossible to say. At least eight of these
passages come from the Discourses of Epictetus, as collected by Arrian.
The rest consists of quotations from Homer and Hesiod, fragments from
the tragic poets, and other reminiscences from Marcus' readings.
In the first part of Book XI, long expositions (of which there are
fourteen) are much more frequent than short sayings (seven) . The phenomenon
of "interwoven composition" scarcely appears, and there are
few recurrent themes, with the exception of the theme of the freedom
which we possess to criticize and to suspend our judgments on events
and things. We find this theme in two passages, almost identical in form
(XI, II; XI, 1 6, 2) :
Things do not reach us, but they remain immobile outside of us.
Several of the longer expositions have no parallel in the rest of Marcus'
work: the detailed description of the properties of the rational soul (XI,
l ), for instance, or the method of division of objects and events (XI, 2) ;
the history of tragedy and comedy (XI, 6) , which I mentioned above; the
description of the luminous sphere of the soul (XI, 1 2), as well as that of
true sincerity which one cannot help discerning immediately, like a
man's bad odor (XI, 1 5) . Finally, there is the long enumeration of the
dogmas which can cure us of anger (XI, 1 8). By its content and its form,
then, Book XI is rather different from the other books of the Meditations.
Book XII also has its characteristic expressions. " Stripped of their
bark" (gumna ton phloii5n), for instance, recurs twice in it. On the one
hand, divine vision sees the guiding principles of souls "stripped of their
bark" (XII, 2) ; on the other, we must exercise ourselves in order to be
able to see the elements of those beings which have causal force-in
other words, none other than the guiding principles of souls-"stripped
Marcus Aurelius in His Meditations 273
of their bark" (XII, 8) . The theme of the separation of the center of the
soul from all its envelopes is, moreover, one of the major motifs of the
Meditations. We find it sketched as early as the first chapter, where we are
urged not to recognize anything but the hegemonikon, or guiding principle
of the soul, as the sole thing of value. The theme is developed in
chapter 2 (like God himself, see nothing but the hegemonikon), and in
chapter 3 (separate everything foreign from the intellect, the faculty of
thought, and the guiding principle of the soul) . We find it again in
chapter 8 (see those elements which have causal value--that is, the guiding
principles of souls--stripped of their bark) ; in chapter r9 (become
aware of what is most noble and divine within us) ; and finally, in chapter
33, where the Emperor asks himself about the use he is making of the
guiding part of his soul, for "Everything depends upon that."
We have just encountered the notion of an " element having a causal
value " (aitiodes). For Marcus, this concept is opposed to the notion of a
material element (hulikon). As we have seen, this is one of the fundamental
oppositions of Stoic physics. For Marcus, however, it serves above all
to formulate a spiritual exercise which is described again and again in
Book XII: it consists in the intellect or guiding part of the soul becoming
aware of itself as a causal, guiding, determining element, so that it may
distinguish and separate itself from the material element. In other words,
it must separate itself not only from the body, but from everything that
does not depend upon us. This is why the theme of the opposition
between the " causal" and the " material" also recurs constantly in Book
XII (XII, 8; XII, r o; XII, r8; XII, 29) .
The preceding brief analyses-no doubt somewhat tedious-should
allow the reader to glimpse the fact that in almost all the books of the
Meditations, a characteristic vocabulary and recurrent themes can be discovered.
This leads us to suspect that each chapter forms a comparatively
autonomous unity. Although it is true that there are many literal repetitions
throughout the Meditations, it is nevertheless also true that particularities
can be observed that are proper to each chapter.
The final three chapters of Book XII, which are also those of the
entire work, are concerned with death. The last chapter, which is in the
form of a dialogue, thus seems particularly moving (XII, 3 6):
0 man, you have played your part as a citizen in this great City!
What does it matter to you whether you have played it for five, or
for one hundred years? For that which is distributed in accordance
with the law is equal for all. What is there that is terrible if you are
274 THE INNER CITA D EL
sent away from this City, not by a tyrant or an unjust judge, but by
that Nature who had put you on stage in the first place, as a praetor
dismisses an actor he has hired?
-But I acted only three acts, and not five!
-You are right; but in life three acts make up a complete play;
for what makes the play complete is determined by He who is the
cause both of constitution and of dissolution. You, by contrast, are
cause neither of the one nor of the other. Leave, then, in peace; for
He who dismisses you does so in peace.
It has been claimed52 that the Meditations deliberately end with the
word "peace." Perhaps; but who placed it there? Was it Marcus, foreseeing
his imminent death? Was it the person who edited his meditations,
and removed one from its place to put it there? These words are, moreover,
an echo of the first pages of Book II (3, 3): "Don't die murmuring,
but truly in peace, thanking the gods from the bottom of your heart."
We can thus see-in an entirely hypothetical way-that some kind of
order and specific correspondences have perhaps been introduced among
these eleven books (II-XII) , which are groups of meditations written on
a daily basis. It could no doubt be objected that in a work in which the
thought of death plays so considerable a role, it is not surprising to
encounter it-whether in the first or the last lines-without this indicating
any kind of stylistic composition. One might also wonder, however,
why at the beginnings of Books III, VIII, X, and XII, we find examinations
of conscience which are all analogously inspired by the imminence
of death. They are situated in a rather privileged position, as if the author
or editor had wanted to provide a kind of introduction to the following
meditations. In these examinations, Marcus exhorts himself to immediate
conversion, for he is afraid that even before death, his intellectual capacities
may be weakened to the point where they no longer allow him to
live a moral life. He is still far from having succeeded in becoming a
philosopher, and he recognizes that, in the last analysis, what he should
fear the most is not ceasing to live, but failing to begin to live (XII, r, 5) .
This is the source of Marcus' melancholy question at the beginning of
Book X:
0 my soul; will you ever be good and simple; one and naked; more
luminous than the body which surrounds you? Will you ever be
fulfilled, without need, neither regretting nor desiring anything ...
Marcus Aurelius in His Meditations 275
Will you ever be happy with what 1s happening to you at the
present moment?
Generally speaking, a short saying is never placed at the beginning of a
book. Books II-XII always open with a relatively lengthy exposition,
which can vary from five to thirty-five lines. Books II and V both begin
with an exercise which is to be practiced in the morning: "At dawn ... ";
" In the morning, when you have trouble getting up ... " The comparatively
long dissertations on the rational soul (XI, 1 ) and on impiety with
regard to nature (IX, I) also seem to have been placed at the beginning of
these books because of the importance of the subject matter with which
they deal.
As I have said, the frequent repetitions which can be observed in the
Meditations allow us to suppose that they were composed on a day-to-day
basis. The slight indications which I have just enumerated, however,
perhaps allow us to glimpse some of Marcus' habits-for instance, that of
beginning a new notebook with a specific type of exhortation. In any
event, I have thought it worthwhile to point out such details in the hope
that they may inspire more in-depth research.
Remembering the dead
As we have seen, the Meditations are dominated, from one end to the
other, by the thought of death. Within the work, death appears successively
as an imminence which may prevent Marcus from finally raising
himself up to the level of the philosophical life; or as a phenomenon of
nature which is no more extraordinary than any other; and finally as a
liberation, which will deliver Marcus from a world where people are
ignorant of the sole value: that of virtue and the moral good.
From beginning to end, the Meditations are also an exercise of preparation
for death, which involves, among other things, evoking famous
figures of bygone times, who, in spite of their power, knowledge, and
renown, died like everybody else. Just like Franr;:ois Villon, Marcus thus
composes his Ballad ef the Lords ef Former Times. To be sure, it was too
early for Marcus to wonder: "But where is the knight Charlemagne?"53
Yet he does mention Alexander-as well as his mule-driver-Archimedes,
Augustus, Caesar, Chrysippus, Croesus, Democritus,
Epictetus, Eudoxus, Heraclitus, Hipparchus, Hippocrates, Menippus,
Philip, Pompey, Pythagoras, Socrates, Tiberius, Trajan, and all those
THE I N NER CITADEL
who are now no more than legendary names (VIII, 25, 3) or are mentioned
only rarely: Caeso, Volesus, Dentatus, Scipio, and Cato. He also
speaks of people who are less noble, but did have their moment of fame,
like the mimographers Philistion, Phoebus, and Origanion (VI, 47, 1).
Marcus also thinks of the whole crowd of anonymous people: doctors,
astrologers, philosophers, princes, and tyrants of bygone days; as well as
the people of Pompeii (IV, 48, 1; VIII, 1, 2) and Herculaneum. Finally,
he thinks of all the people who lived in the time of Vespasian or Trajan:
they have all been swept away by death.
Marcus also thinks of the people he knew during his life. His adoptive
brother Lucius Verus, who reigned together with Marcus, died comparatively
young. He had married Lucilla, one of Marcus' daughters; but
before this marriage, when he was staying at Antioch, he had a mistress
named Pantheia. Pantheia was from Smyrna, and she was delightfully
portrayed by the satirist Lucian in 163-164. She figures in two of his
works: Images and the Defense ef Images. Was she really as beautiful,
cultivated, good-hearted, simple, sweet, and benevolent as Lucian says?
And yet, unless he was mocking her, Lucian could scarcely have made up
such details as that she sang while accompanying herself on the cithara;
that she spoke Ionic Greek; that she behaved modestly and simply to
those who approached her; and that she knew how to laugh at Lucian's
praise. What happened to Pantheia after the marriage of Lucilla? Did she
remain in the entourage of Lucius, who, if we can believe the gossip of
the Historia Augusta, seems not to have had any qualms about bringing
back from Antioch to Rome a band of freed slaves, with whom he
caroused?54
In any event, it is rather touching to encounter the figure of Pantheia
in the Meditations. This allows us to suppose that she had remained close
to Lucius V erus until his death, and that she herself had died a few years
after her lover (VIII, 3 7) :
Are Pantheia and Pergamos [perhaps a male lover of Lucius Verus?]
still sitting near the ashes of V erus?
Or Chabrias and Diotimos near those of Hadrian?
How ridiculous! [probably because they too were dead] .
And even if they were still sitting there, would the dead notice
them? And if the dead noticed them, would they derive pleasure
from their presence? And if the dead did derive some pleasure,
would those who were sitting there be immortal? Has it not been
fixed by Destiny that those who were sitting there should first
Marcus Aurelius in His Meditations 277
become old women and men, and finally die? What will happen to
the dead, when those who had been sitting near their ashes are dead
too?
This same Book VIII describes analogous situations, in which living
people weep for the dead, and are themselves wept over shortly afterwards
(VIII, 25) : Marcus' mother Lucilla, who lost her husband Verus,
and then died in turn; Secunda, the wife of Maximus, one of Marcus'
friends and teachers, who died after having buried Maximus; Antoninus,
Marcus' adoptive father, who decreed the apotheosis of his wife Faustina,
and then did not survive her for long. Marcus also evokes Caninius
Celer, 55 one of his rhetoric teachers, who had been secretary to the
emperor Hadrian, and who had perhaps delivered the latter's funeral
oration. He too was dead by the time Marcus was writing. In this context
we also find a certain Diotimos, no doubt a freedman of Hadrian, and the
same person whom Marcus had pictured sitting near Hadrian's funeral
urn in the description cited above (VIII, 37).
Elsewhere, Marcus again causes all kinds of characters whom he has
known to come to life before our eyes; but it is difficult for us to identify
them.
It is especially in Book I that Marcus evokes the dead who had been
close to him: his parents, his teachers, Antoninus Pius, his adoptive
brother Lucius V erus, and the Empress Faustina. There is no melancholy
in these pages, which retain only the virtues of the beings whom the
Emperor has known and loved. Yet we cannot help feeling that the
Emperor is thinking nostalgically of those whom he has loved, and
whose departure has left him profoundly alone.
The "Confessions" of Marcus Aurelius
There is a sense in which Book I represents Marcus' " Confessions," in
the way that there are " Confessions" of Saint Augustine: not the more or
less indecent confessions of a Jean-Jacques Rousseau, but an act of thanks
for the benefits one has received from gods and men. 56 The book ends
with the following formula:
All this requires the help of the gods and of Good Fortune.
This remark refers especially to chapter 1 7, which enumerates all the
special favors which the gods have granted; but it also applies to the
THE I N NER CITADEL
entire book, for it is thanks to the "help of the gods and of Good
Fortune " that Marcus thinks he has been lucky enough to have the
parents, teachers, and friends that he has had.
Book I has a most peculiar structure. In sixteen chapters of unequal
length, the Emperor evokes sixteen people to whom Destiny has related
him. They have each been the example for him of specific virtues, either
generally or in a given circumstance; or else they have given him a piece
of advice which has had a strong influence upon him. The seventeenth
chapter enumerates the benefits which the gods have showered upon
him throughout his life, by making him meet a certain person or experience
a particular event. There is thus often an echo between the first
sixteen chapters and the seventeenth.
The first chapters provide a sketch, as it were, of the history of a life
which has been a spiritual itinerary. First comes childhood, surrounded
by the tutelary figures of Marcus' grandfather, Annius Verus; his father,
who died so young; his mother; his great-grandfather, Catilius Severus;
his tutor; and a certain Diognetus.
Then we have the discovery of philosophy, with Junius Rusticus, and
Marcus' teachers Apollonius and Sextus. This part of his life is so important
to Marcus that he inverts chronological order, by placing his grammar
teacher, Alexander of Cotiaeum, and his rhetoric teacher, Fronto,
after the philosophers. Then Marcus moves on to his friends and loved
ones, whom he evokes because they have either been models for him, or
philosophy teachers: there was Alexander the Platonist, who was his
secretary for Greek correspondence; the Stoic Cinna Catulus; Claudius
Severus, of whom Marcus remembers especially what he learned from
him about the heroes of Republican Rome; and another statesman, the
Stoic Claudius Maximus. Chapter 16 contains a lengthy portrait of the
emperor Antoninus Pius. By living with him for twenty-three yearsfrom
the age of seventeen until he became emperor at the age of fortyMarcus
had been able to observe his adoptive father at length, and to be
profoundly influenced by him.
In the course of the enumeration in chapter r 7 of the favors which the
gods have granted Marcus, some of these characters reappear, especially
Antoninus Pius, Marcus' relatives, his mother, and three philosopherfriends:
Apollonius, Rusticus, and Maximus. He also evokes his grandfather's
concubine, and two " temptations" named Benedicta and Theodotus;
as well as his adoptive brother Lucius Verus, and Marcus' wife, the
Empress Faustina.
In all likelihood, other people had also played a crucial role in Marcus'
Marcus Aurelius in His Meditations 279
life. One thinks, for example, of Herodes Atticus, the "ancient billionaire.
"57 This renowned rhetor, such a powerful figure in Athens, had
been Marcus' rhetoric teacher; but he does not appear in Book I. In this
particular case, there could be two reasons for such silence. In the first
place, Herodes was a shady character. Marcus had a great deal of affection
for him, and guided him through the two trials in which Herodes was
implicated, particularly in 17 4, when Hero des was summoned to the
Emperor's headquarters at Sirmium on charges brought against him by
the Athenians.58 Nevertheless, Marcus could hardly fail to recognize that
Herodes was scarcely a model for the philosophical life. Another reason
for Marcus' silence could possibly be that the Emperor seems to talk only
about the dead in Book I, whereas Herodes did not die until 179. We
might thus suppose that Book I was written between 1 76 and 1 79,
perhaps at Rome in 1 77 or 178.
To understand the way Marcus wrote Book I, it will perhaps be
sufficient to examine how he evokes the figure of Fronto, his Latin
rhetoric teacher. When we read the correspondence exchanged between
Fronto and Marcus, we get the impression of an intimate friendship, with
a perpetual exchange of ideas, advice, and favors. Thus, one would
expect Book I to contain a lengthy couplet on Marcus' venerated
teacher. Yet the Emperor devotes only three lines to him, whereas he
uses thirteen lines to speak of his debt toward Rusticus. What has Marcus
retained from all those years of working intimacy with Fronto? Only two
things, which have nothing to do with rhetoric (I, 1 1):
To have learned how tyranny leads to envious evil, to caprices, and
to dissimulation; and how, on the whole, those whom we call
"patricians" are somehow lacking in affectionateness.
Marcus' remark about the patricians is indeed attested in his correspondence
with Fronto; and this allows us to glimpse that behind each
one of Marcus' notes, there is certainly a precise matter of fact. For
instance, Fronto writes to the emperor Lucius Verus, in order to recommend
to him one of his students, Gavius Clams. He praises Gavius'
conscientiousness, modesty, reserve, generosity, simplicity, continence,
truthfulness, and entirely Roman uprightness:
... I don't know if his affectionateness (philostorgia) is Roman, for in
all my life at Rome, there is nothing I have found less often than a
man having sincere affectionateness. I would not be surprised if,
280 THE I N NER CITADEL
since there is really no one to be found at Rome who has affectionateness,
there is no Latin word to designate this virtue. 59
When he writes to the proconsul Lollianus Avitus to recommend
Licinius Montanus to him, Fronto uses an analogous enumeration: "He
is sober, honest, tender in his affections (philostorgus) ... " And he notes
once again that there is no Latin word for that quality.60 When Marcus
writes to his teacher in Latin, he addresses him in Greek as philostorge
anthrope, as if there were indeed no Latin equivalent for this Greek
word.61 We may wonder whether this remark does not contain a hint of
resentment on the part of the provincial homo novus Fronto with regard
to the old Roman aristocracy. In any case, Fronto's remark struck Marcus,
and we may suppose that he too sensed a lack of tenderness of the
heart in the ruling class. In the Meditations, Marcus exhorts himself several
times to be affectionate (VI, 3 0, 2; II, 5, r; XI, r8, r 8), while in Book
I he notes the philostorgia of his teacher Sextus.
With regard to Marcus' remarks on tyranny as a corruption of monarchy
which consists in profiting from power for one's own pleasure: we
possess no text by Fronto that might shed light on this allusion. It may
have come from a conversation they had, or from a Latin literary text
relative to this theme which Marcus had studied together with his
teacher. At any rate, the Emperor retained the idea that the egotistical
exercise of power leads to evil, inconstancy, and dissimulation. As R. B.
Rutherford has rightly pointed out,62 Marcus was particularly affected by
this idea because, as Emperor, he was the precisely the one who could
easily become a tyrant. Marcus was a "potential tyrant," and on several
occasions the Meditations ask him to question himself in order to see
whether he does not have a tyrannical soul. This is particularly the case in
IV, 28, which may be understood as a kind of description of the tyrannical
character:
A dark character: effeminate, harsh, savage, bestial, puerile, cowardly,
false, foolish, mercenary, and tyrannical.
Elsewhere, such tyrants as Phalaris and Nero appear as yanked about by
their disorderly tendencies, like wild, androgynous beasts (III, r 6).
From his long familiarity with Fronto, then, Marcus either can or will
retain no more than two items of moral instruction. He evokes no virtue
or character trait of Fronto's worthy of being mentioned.
This means that Book I is not a collection of recollections in which
Marcus Aurelius in His Meditations 281
the Emperor causes those he has known to live again just as they were.
Rather, it is a kind of precise record of those who have played a role in
his life. The very style of the book makes it resemble the inventory of an
inheritance, or an acknowledgement of debt.63 At the beginning of each
chapter, we first have a kind of label: " From my grandfather Verus ... ,"
" From my mother ... , " " From Sextus ... , " " From Fronto ... " Then
the qualities Marcus admires are enumerated, as are the teachings he has
received and the exemplary actions performed. Grammatically, all this is
expressed by neuter adjectives used substantively, or by an infinitive
proposition; there are hardly any personally inflected verbs. Marcus does
not say, " From my grandfather, I admired ... ," or "I retained," or "I
learned"; but rather " From my grandfather Verus: good character and
lack of anger." Thus, this balance-sheet concerns the virtues which Marcus
saw practiced, the advice he heard, specific actions and significant
examples which made an impression on him, and finally the benefits
which he received.
In the case of some of the figures Marcus evokes, their personality
disappears completely behind the advice they have given to the Emperor.
Marcus mentions no particular virtue in the case of his tutor, or of
Diognetus, or of Rusticus, or of Fronto. This does not mean that they
did not possess any moral qualities, but that it was not by means of such
qualities that they influenced Marcus. What "made " Marcus Aurelius
were, for instance, the reprimands about his character addressed to him
by Rusticus, or the fact that he communicated to him Epictetus' Discourses.

In the case of some other figures, such as that of his mother, the
Emperor evokes only those virtues which were obviously exemplary for
him (I, 3):
From my mother: piety; a disposition to give generously; and a
horror not only of doing evil, but even of thinking about doing evil.
In addition, frugality in my daily routine, far removed from the
life-style of the rich.
The same holds true for Claudius Maximus, whose entire personality
was exemplary for Marcus: self-mastery; peace of mind in adversity;
gentleness and dignity; reflection in the carrying out of a project; harmony
between words, actions, and moral conscience; the quality of not
being surprised by anything, of fearing nothing, and of remaining self-
THE I N NER CITADEL
identical; beneficence; indulgence; veracity; spontaneity in action; and
the art of joking.
Finally, there are those of whom Marcus has remembered both the
teachings and the virtues, such as Severus, who was beneficent, liberal,
and free-speaking, but who also caused Marcus to discover the entire
philosophical tradition of resistance to tyranny.
Through this catalogue of virtues and of teachings, an outline of
Marcus' life itself is traced. Thus, thanks to his great-grandfather, he
benefited from instruction at home; thanks to his tutor, he learned not to
get caught up in the partisan battles of fans of the Greens and the
Whites-factions of the circus games-and not to get excited about any
particular group of gladiators. Diognetus turned him away from futilities,
superstitions, and playing with quails, and instilled in him a taste for a
Spartan life-style. Rusticus showed him the need to correct his character:
as he taught him philosophy, he also prevented Marcus from getting
carried away by enthusiasm for writing theoretical or hortatory philosophical
tracts, and from falling into ostentatious asceticism. Rusticus
made him give up rhetoric and poetry, and taught him simplicity of style,
particularly by the example of a letter he had written to Marcus' mother.
He taught Marcus how to read philosophical texts, and, most important,
passed on to him some notes taken at the classes of Epictetus. More than
any precise teachings, the Emperor retained the examples of how to live
given him by his other philosophy teachers, Apollonius and Sextus.
From Alexander the grammarian, Marcus learned the art of reprimanding
people without annoying them, and of making them aware of
their faults indirectly. By frequenting Alexander "the Platonist," his secretary
for Greek correspondence, the Emperor learned not to try to get
out of his duties toward other people by claiming that one has no time to
reply to letters. In the case of Marcus' three friends Catulus, Severus, and
Maximus, it was especially their virtues which were exemplary; but
Marcus owed Severus the discovery of an entire political attitude: the
monarchy's respect for the freedom of its subjects. I shall return to this
point.
Finally, there was the encounter with Antoninus, who, in his entire
behavior, revealed to the future Emperor the features of the ideal ruler.
Chapter 1 7, which celebrates the benefits which the gods have showered
upon him, gives Marcus the opportunity to go over the stages of his
life once again. After the death of his father, the young Marcus lived
briefly in the house of his grandfather, Annius Verus. It seems that this
was a time of temptations for Marcus, and he thanks the gods for
Marcus Aurelius in His Meditations
not having been brought up for too long with my grandfather's
concubine; for having been able to maintain the bloom of my
youth; for not having reached manhood too soon, but having even
gone past the time for that.
Then comes youth, the time of Marcus' adoption by the emperor
Antoninus Pius, at the age of seventeen (in 138). Once again, the main
discovery which Marcus made then was that of simplicity (I, 1 7, 5) :
to have been subject to a ruler who was to take away from me every
trace of pride, and give me the idea that it was possible to live at
court without any bodyguards, nor conspicuous dress, nor the
lamps and statues which go along with it; nor in general with any of
this kind of pomp; but that one may very well restrict oneself to a
kind of life very close to that of a private citizen, without thereby
becoming base or indifferent toward devoting oneself like a sovereign
to what must be done for the public good.
His adoption would give Marcus an adoptive brother, Lucius Verus (I,
l 7, 6) ; and Marcus thanks the gods for having made him meet
such a brother, who, by his character, could awaken me to take care
of myself, and who, at the same time, made me happy by his
deference and his affection.
Soon would come Marcus' marriage to Faustina (in 145) , which Marcus
mentions further on. At the moment, he thinks of his children, "who
were neither ungifted nor misshapen. "
This was also the time of his rhetorical studies with Pronto and
Herodes Atticus, but Marcus makes no allusion to them in this chapter.
Too much success in this field would have taken him away from philosophy,
but here again the gods were watchful (I, 1 7, 8) :
Not to have made too much progress in rhetoric, poetry, and the
other occupations, by which I might have been caught up, if I had
felt that I was making good progress in them.
In any case, Marcus has, thanks to the gods, done everything to repay
his teachers (I, 1 7, 9) :
THE I N NER CITADEL
To have hurried to establish my teachers in the honorific positions
which it seemed to me they wanted, and not to have left them in
the mere hope that I would do it later, since they were still young.
Finally comes the main point: philosophy and its practice (I, 1 7, rn):
To have known Apollonius, Rusticus, and Maximus. To have had
clear and frequent representations of the "life according to nature,"
so that, insofar as it depends on the gods and on the communications,
assistance, and inspirations which come from above, nothing
now prevents me from living " according to nature "; but I am far
from that point by my own fault, because I pay no attention to the
reminders, or rather to the teachings, which come from the gods.
Thus, divine graces helped Marcus to practice philosophy, and also to
resist the temptations of luxuriousness and anger, as well as the fatigue of
the imperial life (I, 1 7, 1 2):
That my body has resisted such a life for so long.
This brief remark perhaps allows us to glimpse the hardships which
Marcus endured while on the Danubian campaign.
Not to have touched Benedicta or Theodotus; and later on, when I
did fall prey to erotic passions, that I was cured.
Marcus was not the impassive Stoic that many have imagined. There
were, of course, his youthful infatuations with Benedicta and Theodotus,
about whom we know nothing; perhaps Marcus met them while living
with his grandfather. But there were also more mature passions, from
which he was able to be cured. We should recall, moreover, that after the
death of Faustina, Marcus took in a concubine, with whom he lived for
the last three years of his life.64
Although I often got angry with Rusticus, that I did not do anything
extreme, which I would later have regretted.
There were thus stormy relations between the disciple and his director of
conscience; but Marcus does not say whether they were limited to the
period of his youth and philosophical education, or whether they contin-
Marcus Aurelius in His Meditations 285
ued after he became Emperor, when Rusticus became a highly influential
counselor to Marcus.
It was also a blessing from the gods that his mother, who died young,
was able to live with him for the last years of her life, at the court of
Antoninus. Another was that he was always able to help the needy. It was
another blessing for Marcus to have had such a wife, in the person of the
Empress Faustina, "so sweet, so affectionate, so lacking in artifice." Finally,
it was a blessing that he was able to provide his children with a
good education.
Marcus then evokes the remedies against spitting blood and dizziness,
which were revealed to him in dreams.
Finally, Marcus returns to a theme he has already mentioned when
speaking ofRusticus: not the least of the gods' blessings was the fact that
he did not become interested in abstract philosophical discourse, either
logical or concerning the study of nature. Rather, we are to understand
that Marcus learned, above all, to live in a philosophical way. "All this,"
Marcus concludes, "requires the help of the gods and ofFortune." In the
last analysis, "all this" is the entire content of the Meditations: all those
relatives, teachers, and friends who showered him with examples and
advice; but also the divine inspirations which helped him in his physical
and spiritual life. I have spoken earlier of the two viewpoints of the Stoic
conception of providence, and I have said that these two viewpoints-a
general law of the universe, indifferent to individual beings, and a particular
action on the part of the gods, which takes care of individualswere
not mutually exclusive. Book I can obviously be classified under
the second perspective: that of particular providence. In this book, Marcus
sees his entire life in the peaceful light of the gods' solicitude for him.
The reader may be surprised that the author of the Meditations, reigning
over an immense empire, overwhelmed with worries, but also used
to elevating himself to grandiose visions which embraced the immensity
of space and time, would thank the gods for things which may seem
mundane or even trivial, such as the fact that he did not make progress in
rhetoric. Other subjects for thanks do not rise above the level of the
aspirations of an ordinary man: to raise his children well; to be in good
health; to have good parents and a loving wife.
Perhaps we are touching here upon a particular aspect of Marcus'
psychology. Thanks to his study of Epictetus and the Stoics, Marcus is
quite capable of meditating, in a remarkable style, upon highly elevated
themes. From his mother, however, as well as from Rusticus and Antoninus,
he learned to live at court the life of an ordinary man; for instance,
286 THE I N NER CITADEL
as we know from his correspondence with Fronto, he helped the farm
workers with the grape harvest. We do not find in Marcus an aristocratic
or rhetorical search for "great feelings" or geopolitical perspectives; instead,
we find a highly characteristic attention paid to the realities of daily
life. This was, moreover, also the lesson taught by Epictetus. In order to
show that you are a human being, the latter used to say, " eat like a
human being; drink like a human being; get married; have children" (III,
21, 4-6) . In Marcus' case, we may add to the equation a certain candor,
naivete, and simplicity, which made him search, in the pitiless world of
the Roman aristocracy, for tenderness, affection, and warmth of feelings,
and the authenticity of simple human relations.
In the remaining books of the Meditations, we find only a very small
number of autobiographical references. There are a few allusions to
Marcus' name and his position as Emperor, and to his adoptive father,
Antoninus Pius, of whom Marcus traces a brief portrait (VI, 3 0) which
seems to be a sketch for the one that can now be read in Book I. There
are also a few words on Marcus' old age (II, 2, 4; II, 6) ; on his difficulty in
getting up in the morning (V, l; VIII, 12); and on the repugnance he
feels for life at court (VIII, 9) and for the games of the circus (VI, 46) .
What is completely remarkable, both in Book I and throughout the
Meditations, is Marcus' consciousness of his own fallibility65-to the point
that his " Confessions" are also a kind of confession of his faults. This is an
eminently Stoic attitude (Epictetus, II, l l, l):
The starting-point of philosophy is our consciousness of our weakness
and our incapacity with regard to necessary things.
For Marcus, however, this attitude perhaps comes naturally. In the first
place, he admits that he has not really succeeded so far in living like a
philosopher (VII, l); that his soul is not yet in the dispositions of peace
and love in which it should be (X, l); that, despite reprieves and warnings
from the gods, it is his fault that he does not yet live "according to
Nature," that is, according to Reason (I, 1 7, I I ) . What is more, he
perceives within himself a disposition to commit errors (I, 1 7, 2; XI, 18,
7) ; and if he does not commit a given error, it is only out of fear and of
what others will say. Basically, however, he is no different from those
whom he criticizes (XI, 18, 7) . He also admits that he can be wrong, and
he accepts that his errors must be corrected (VI, 21; VIII, 1 6). He knows
that he runs the risk of seeing defects where there are in fact none (IX,
Marcus Aurelius in His Meditations
3 8; XII, 1 6); and he willingly accepts assistance, like a lame soldier incapable
of climbing up a wall (VII, 7; VII, 5).
Marcus is, moreover, perfectly aware of the limits of his intelligence
(V, 5, r ) :
They can hardly admire your quickness of mind. So be it! But there
are many other things about which you cannot say, "I am not
gifted." Show us, then, all these things that depend entirely on you:
being without duplicity, being serious ... being free ...
To be sure, we do not find in Marcus the fondness for self-accusation
which we find in Augustine, who is persuaded a priori of the corruption
of human nature. It does seem, however, that Marcus was gifted by
nature with an acute self-consciousness, and a considerable capacity for
self-criticism; or rather with the ability of examining himself with objectivity,
in which he recognized his faults, but also his qualities. The following
brief remark is noteworthy (VIII, 42) :
I don't deserve to be ashamed of myself, for I have never voluntarily
harmed anyone.
Near to death, Marcus makes a summation of his life which is, in the
last analysis, confident and positive (V, 31, 2) :
Remind yourself of what kinds of things you have gone through,
and what you have been able to bear. The story of your life is full,
and your service is complete. Remember all the fine things you
have seen; all the pleasures and sufferings you have overcome; all
the motives for glory which you have despised; all the ingrates to
whom you have been benevolent.
Renan66 was critical of Marcus' " Confessions," especially as they appear
in Book I:
He could see the baseness of humanity, but he did not admit it to
himself This way of voluntarily blinding oneself is the defect of
elite hearts. Since the world is not the way they would like it to be,
they lie to themselves, in order to see it as other than it is. The result
of this is a certain conventionality of judgment. In Marcus, this
conventionality is sometimes annoying: if we were to believe him,
288 THE I N NER CITA D EL
his teachers-several of whom were fairly mediocre men-would
all, without exception, have been superior beings.
This judgment is far off the mark. In the first place, Marcus tried to
render to each person exactly what he or she was owed, and no more;
we have seen this in the case of Fronto. Let us also note what he says
about his adoptive brother, Lucius Verus-who, although his exact personality
is difficult to determine, can at least be said to have been extremely
different from Marcus. Marcus does not say that Verus was
perfect; on the contrary, when he saw Verus' life-style, Marcus was led to
watch himself so as not to imitate him. In the end, Verus' bad example
was a blessing from the gods; and all Marcus adds is that his brother
showed deference and affection for him. It also seems as though Marcus
made a careful choice of whom to mention and whom, since they had
not contributed anything to him, he could ignore.
Book I is simultaneously an act of thanksgiving and a confession; a
balance sheet of divine action and of Marcus' own resistance to divine
action. For Marcus, this action took place in the only important area: that
of moral value and virtue. He does not thank the gods for having elevated
him to the Empire, nor for having granted him victory over the
Germans, but for having guided him toward the philosophical life, with
the help of a few men who were sent to him providentially.
Verus or fictus: "sincere " or " affected"
A passage from the Life ef Marcus Aurelius contained in the Historia
Augusta shows us that the Emperor's contemporaries wondered what his
real personality was:
Some also complained that he was affected (fictus) and not so simple
(simplex) as he seemed, or as Antoninus Pius and Verus had been.67
A play on words is involved here: Marcus' original name was Annius
V erus, and the word verus evokes sincerity. The emperor Hadrian, who
had known Marcus in his childhood, had even given him the nickname
Verissimus, " the very sincere." Some of Marcus' detractors, then, apparently
said that he should have been called not Verus but Fictus-that is,
not " Sincere " but "Affected." This criticism probably came from the
historian Marius Maximus,68 who had begun his political career in the
Marcus Aurelius in His Meditations
last years of Marcus' reign. Maximus collected all the current gossip
about the imperial family, and the Historia Augusta often echoes him.
Cassius Dio, a historian who was more or less contemporary with
Marius Maximus, maintains a position that is diametrically opposed:
He obviously did nothing out of affectation (prospoietos), but everything
out of virtue . . . he remained the same through everything,
and did not change on any point. To such an extent was he a truly
good man, and there was nothing affected about him. 69
To reproach Marcus with affectation was in fact to reproach him with
being a philosopher. The philosophical life he led caused him to have a
strange attitude, which was different from that of other people, and
therefore "affected," in their view.
Cassius Dio, for instance, who recognized the Emperor's sincerity, was
astonished at the extraordinary clemency which he showed on the occasion
of the rebellion by Avidius Cassius: "Nothing could force him to do
anything alien to his own character: not the idea of making an example
of someone, nor the magnitude of the crime. "70
In fact, however, we must go further, and recognize the genuine
difficulty of moral life. Whoever tries to control himself, to practice
spiritual exercises, to transform himself, and to act with conscientiousness
and reflection gives the impression of lacking spontaneity and of being
calculating. Here we confront the eternal problem of moral effort, and of
work by oneself upon oneself We know, for example, that Marcus, in
order to correct his own conduct, had investigations made concerning
what the public was saying about him; when the criticisms were justified,
he modified his behavior. 71
The Emperor was quite conscious of this danger, which may be insurmountable.
In Book I, he expresses his admiration for Claudius
Maximus, because he gave the impression of being a man who was
naturally "straight" and not one who has corrected or "straightened"
himself (I, I 5, 8) . The same theme is present in other books of the
Meditations:
One must be straight, and not straightened (III, 5, 4; VII, 12).
When Marcus praises sincerity (XI, 1 5), he criticizes people who
begin by saying "I shall speak frankly to you," and then obviously do
nothing of the kind. Frankness, says Marcus, is written on one's face; it
THE I N NER CITA D EL
resonates in the voice and shines in the eyes. It is perceived immediately,
as the beloved perceives love in the eyes of his lover. Good, simple, and
benevolent people have their qualities in their eyes: they do not remain
hidden. Marcus demanded that moral action be perfectly natural, as if it
were unconscious, without any return upon itsel(
It is possible that the gods, to whom Marcus addresses his thanks at the
end of Book I, did not bestow upon him the supreme blessing, in the
sense of supreme ease and beauty: the ability to make others believe that
one does good deeds by nature. I think, however, that no one can deny
the good will and scrupulous conscientiousness with which Marcus attempted
to do good. In this point, at least, he was scrupulously sincere.
The solitude of the emperor and of the philosopher
In the famous portrait of the philosopher which he sketches m the
Theaetetus (1 74e) , Plato did not forget to mention what the philosopher
thinks of kings and tyrants. What is a king? What is a tyrant? A shepherd
or a cowherd, who is happy ifhe can squeeze lots of milk from his herd.
In fact, however, he is not as fortunate as he seems, for the beasts he must
milk and pasture are much more unpleasant, difficult, sneaky, and treacherous
than those of a simple shepherd. Moreover, absorbed by the cares
of governing these disagreeable beasts called men, he has no more mental
freedom, and he is just as rough and uncultivated as the shepherds, " once
he has surrounded himself with an enclosure around his animal pen in
the mountains."
This is precisely what Marcus the philosopher tells Marcus the emperor:
wherever he goes, he will be enclosed in the prison of poweralone,
without any leisure, and confronted by the sneaky beasts mentioned
by Plato (X, 23):
Let it always be clear to you that your countryside is the place
where you are living at this moment, and that everything here is
identical to what is on a high mountain or on the seashore, or
wherever you like; you'll immediately find there what Plato talks
about: " Surrounding himself with a pen in the mountains," he says,
and " milking his flocks."
What Marcus means is the following: wherever you go, you will find the
prison of power and the solitude in which you are enclosed by your
position as shepherd of men. Wherever you go, however, it will be
Marcus Aurelius in His Meditations
within you and only within you that you will find that countryside,
seashore, or mountain which can liberate you from the prison you find
everywhere (c£ IV, 3, l). In other words, it is the emperor's inner
dispositions that will decide if he is imprisoned within his mountain
enclosure, like Plato's king, or if he will find pleasure and relaxation in
the mountains or the countryside, as he would like. No matter where we
go, we find-according to our wishes-servitude or freedom.
"Mountain" here has two meanings: it is the symbol of the enclosure
within which the tyrant/king lives as a prisoner together with the flock
of animals he exploits; but it is also the symbol of retreat within ourselves
and the inner freedom which we can find anywhere, as long as we want
it (X, 15, 2) :
Live as if you were on a mountain. It doesn't matter whether one
lives in one place or another, as long as one lives everywhere as
within one's own City, which is the World.
And yet the philosopher's inner retreat, which is his philosophical life in
conformity with Stoicism, will provoke another solitude and rupture
between the flock and its shepherd: a serious disparity between the values
of both parties.
This uneasiness explains Marcus' repugnance with regard to life at
court, which he compares to a stepmother (VI, 12), whereas his true
mother is philosophy, which allows him to put up with the court, and to
make himself bearable to those who live at court. Yet he blames himself
for this attitude (VIII, 9) :
Let no one hear you blame the life people lead at court any longer!
Let not you yourself hear yourself doing it!
Here we encounter once again what we could call the theme oflife on a
mountain: wherever one can live, one can live well; that is to say,
philosophically. But it is possible to live at court; therefore, it is possible
to live well there (V, 1 6, 2) . Marcus gives this argument as an example of
the way in which the soul can suffuse itself with specific representations.
Marcus' repugnance for life at court was not, however, mere superficial
annoyance: rather, the discord ran extremely deep. As he continues
this meditation on life " on a mountain"-that is to say, within the
City of the World-Marcus allows us to glimpse just how deep this
discord and this rupture go (X, l 5, 3):
292 THE I N NER CITADEL
Let people see and discover what a man who truly lives in accordance
with nature is like! If they can't put up with you, then let them
kill you! That would be better than to live like them!
The conflict is situated in the profound difference between the two
parties' principles of life, and it is summarized by Marcus in a lapidary
formula which opposes the two Greek words homothamnein and homodogmatein
(XI, 8, 6) :
Grow on the same trunk, but don't profess the same principles.
These two duties are hard to reconcile: on the one hand, our duty to
love other human beings, with whom we form one single body, tree, or
city; on the other, our duty not to let ourselves be cajoled into adopting
their false values and maxims oflife.
This is the drama of Marcus' life. He loves mankind, and wants to love
them; but he hates what they love. Only one thing counts for him: the
search for virtue and the purity of moral intention. This human worldfrom
which this unique value is absent-provokes in Marcus an intense
reprobation and lassitude; yet he gets hold of himself, and attempts to
reintroduce gentleness and indulgence within himself
This disgust and lassitude make Marcus long for death, and he knows
that this is wrong. We know how important a part is played in the
Meditations by the "helps," or arguments for preparing oneself for death.
Some are entirely philosophical, as for instance those which teach us to
consider death as a particular case of universal metamorphosis, or a mystery
of nature (II, 12, 3; IV, 5; IX, 3, 1-4) . Some of them, however, are
not philosophical, but are coarse (idiotika) and vulgar, although highly
effective: for instance, those which consist in making a list of people who
hung on desperately to life, unwilling to let go, and who nevertheless
died (IV, 50). A similar consideration, which Marcus admits (IX, 3, 5) is
also completely unphilosophical (idiotikon), but which touches the heart,
consists in telling oneself that, in the last analysis, what one is leaving is
not really worth much. This method consists in
carefully examining the kinds of objects from which you are about
to separate yourself, and with what bad characters your soul will no
longer be mixed. To be sure, you must by no means be disgusted by
them; on the contrary, you must be filled with solicitude for them,
and put up with them gently. Nevertheless, you must also remem-
Marcus Aurelius in His Meditations 293
her that you must take leave of people who do not share your
principles. If it were possible, the only thing which could push you
back in the other direction and maintain you in life, would be if it
were possible for you to live in a society of people who had adopted
the same principles as you.
As things are, however, you can see how much you are filled
with lassitude at the discords of social life; to the point where you
say: " Hurry up, 0 Death, lest I too forget mysel£ "
One thinks of Baudelaire's cry, so expressive of fatigue with terrestrial
life and an aspiration for the infinite: "0 Death, old captain ... this land
is boring! Let us cast off!" Yet if Marcus calls on Death to come quickly,
it is less out oflassitude than out of fear of becoming similar to those who
forget themselves and live in a state of unconsciousness.
The disgust which Marcus feels for his entourage is certainly surprising.
Did he not surround himself with friends and counselors who were
also philosophers, like his beloved Rusticus and all those whom we were
able to glimpse thanks to the testimony of Galen? It could be supposed
that, by these last years of Marcus' life, his friends had disappeared, and
that he now misses the beginning of his reign. And yet we know from
Cassius Dio72 that Marcus admitted that no one could be perfect:
He used to say that it is impossible to create people as one would
like them to be, but that each one had to be utilized in the task
which he was capable of accomplishing.
He used to praise them for the service they had rendered, and he
paid no attention to the rest of their behavior.
Are we to suppose that he had become more intransigent in his old
age? Alternatively, can we perceive in these lines the disappointment
Marcus felt as he saw the development of the character of Commodus?
This was the view of Renan, especially a propos of another passage (X,
3 6), which is also very striking in its expression of lassitude and disappointment:

No one is so well-favored by Destiny that, at the moment of his
death, he is not surrounded by people who will rejoice at this sad
event. The dead man was conscientious and well-behaved; yet
someone will finally turn up to say, "This schoolteacher (paidagogos)
294 THE I N NER CITADEL
will now finally let us breathe. To be sure, he was not harsh with
any of us; but I could feel that he was condemning us in silence."
Later on in the text, Marcus opposes the case of this good man to his
own situation. In a sense, however, when he speaks of this good man, he
is already thinking about himself; for he is well aware of the fact that not
only those around him, but also the entire Empire, knew that he was
trying to be a philosopher. An apocryphal letter from Lucius Verus to his
adoptive brother, preserved by the Historia Augusta, may reflect an opinion
widespread in Marcus' time: it warns Marcus that Avidius Cassius,
who was to revolt against him near the end of Marcus' reign, spoke of
him as an " old woman who plays at being a philosopher. "73 Many people
must have had similar views of the Emperor; perhaps they had even
nicknamed him "the pedagogue." In any case, Marcus uses this description
of the death of a good man as an a fortiori argument: if such a man
must expect such an end, then all the more must Marcus himself expect
similar reactions at the moment of his own death:
This is what people will say about a good man. In my case, however,
how many more reasons there are for there to be many people
to want to get rid of me . You'll have to think of that when you die.
You will leave life more easily, if you think: the life that I am
leaving is one in which my associates (koinonoi), for whom I have
fought so hard and prayed so much, for whom I have had so much
concern, want me to go away. Perhaps they hope for some relief
from my disappearance.
Who were these associates or companions (koinonoi)? They could have
been the Emperor's counselors, who made up the imperial council and
who, in the words of the Emperor's contemporary Aelius Aristides, were
participants in power. Yet the expressions "I have fought so hard" and "I
have prayed so much" imply a very special relationship between the
Emperor and these "associates." It is hard not to think, with Renan, of
Commodus, Marcus' young son, who had been given imperial power in
1 77, three years before the Emperor's death, and who was probably
already manifesting the disastrous tendencies that would develop during
his reign.
Be that as it may, Marcus transforn1s his meditation on the ingratitude
of others into a preparation for death. Unlike the preparation mentioned
above, this one is not philosophical, since it sins against the discipline of
action, which requires us to love our fellow human beings. Nevertheless,
Marcus Aurelius in His Meditations 295
it is powerfully effective, since it diminishes the anguish and suffering
caused by the loss oflife:
Why should we try to prolong our stay in this place?
Yet Marcus corrects himself immediately (X, 36, 6) :
And yet, don't go away for that reason less well-disposed toward
them. Rather, you must remain faithful to your own character, and
be friendly, benevolent, and merciful toward them.
This is the disposition in which we should always remain. Yet lassitude
and disappointment sometimes win the day, and Marcus implicitly recognizes
that they are not philosophical, but are a weakness, and perhaps
even a pass10n.
Such a complex sentiment appears to consist of several elements. In
the first place, we find in it a view of human frailty that is free of illusion.
Marcus had a sharp and highly realistic sense of both his own fallibility
and that of others, which sometimes went so far as to consider these
others incorrigible (VIII, 4) :
They'll still do the same things, even if it kills you!
As W. Williams has shown, this is why Marcus was always careful to
dot the i's and cross the t's of the official documents which expressed his
decisions. He seems to have feared that his subordinates might fail to
understand his orders, or refuse to carry them out in the way he wanted.
For instance, in one case a slave was set free by a will, but this might have
been contested because of the form of the will. Marcus, however, was in
favor of the " cause of freedom," and always tended to make enfranchisement
easier; thus he took the trouble to specify that his decision should
be not left as a dead letter, by bringing up some other motive, such as the
fact that the Treasury might claim the property left by the testator. As
Marcus writes,
Those who have our interests at heart must know that the cause of
freedom is to be placed before all financial advantage.74
One the one hand, we can perceive here the importance of the human,
moral point of view for Marcus. On the other hand, we can also
glimpse a certain lack of confidence in the intellectual and moral qualities
THE I N NER CITADEL
of his subordinates. These difficulties with his entourage, moreover, took
on greater proportions as a result of Marcus' undeniable propensity toward
anger, which the Emperor made no attempt to conceal; he was
aware that becoming angry constituted a weakness (XI, 9, 2) .
The main cause of Marcus' lassitude, however, was his passionate love
for moral good. A world in which this absolute value was not recognized
seemed to him an empty world, in which life no longer had any meaning.
As he grew old in such an enormous empire, in the huge crowds
which surrounded and acclaimed him, in the atrocious Danubian war as
well as in the triumphal parades of the city of Rome, he felt himself
alone. Marcus felt a void around himself, since he could not realize his
ideal (IX, 3, 7) : to live in community with others, in search of the only
thing necessary.
Political models
Marcus does not propose any specific governmental program in the
Meditations. This should not surprise us, for he is less concerned with
what must be done than with how it must be done. Nevertheless, Book I
does contain some allusions to political practice. Through Claudius
Severus, Marcus writes (I, 1 4), he has come to know Thrasea, Helvidius,
Cato, Dio, and Brutus. This list of names has a quite precise meaning.75
Paetus Thrasea was the famous senator who, in the year 66, was forced
to commit suicide because of his outspoken opposition to the emperor
Nero. Helvidius Priscus, Thrasea's son-in-law, was assassinated in the
reign of Vespasian, probably in the year 75. Both were opponents of the
emperors, and this attitude was a kind of family tradition, in which the
women also often took part. The portraits of these martyrs were kept
within the great aristocratic families, and their biographies were written.
Under some emperors, however, writing such works also meant risking
death. At the beginning of his Life of Agricola, Tacitus evokes the happiness
which the emperor Nerva brought to Rome by establishing a reign
which, says Tacitus, reconciled monarchy and freedom. Under Nerva's
predecessor Domitian, by contrast, it had been forbidden to write the
biographies of opponents of the emperor.
Arulenus Rusticus wrote a panegyric of Paetus Thrasea, and Herennius
Senecion wrote one of Helvidius Priscus: both paid with their
lives ... It was thought that the voice of the Roman people, the
Marcus Aurelius in His Meditations 297
free speech �ibertas) of the Senate, and the conscience of the human
race could be stifled.
It was almost fifty years after these events that Marcus Aurelius,
through the intermediary of Claudius Severus, discovered this tradition
of opposition. In turn, however, these opponents of the Empire had
maintained the cult of other, older martyrs, who had lived in the last
stages of the Republic, under Caesar. When Juvenal, a contemporary of
Tacitus, speaks in his Satires 0/, 36) of the high quality of a wine, he
writes that it is similar to that which Paetus Thrasea and Helvidius Priscus
drank on the birthdays of Brutus and Cassius, the murderers of Caesar.
According to Marcus, Claudius Severus had also told him about the
figure of Brutus, who lived in the first century B.C. (85-42) , and about
Cato. The figure in question is obviously Cato of Utica (95-46) , who, as
an opponent of Caesar, committed suicide upon the approach of the
latter's troops.
Did Claudius Severus provide Marcus with the biographies of
Thrasea, Helvidius Priscus, Brutus, and Cato? Thrasea had written a life
of Cato, and Helvidius a life of Thrasea, while Herennius Senecion had
composed a life of Helvidius. Did Claudius also have Marcus read the
parallel lives of Brutus and Dio of Syracuse, written by Plutarch, who
had also composed the parallel lives of Phocion and Cato of Utica? It is in
any case surprising to see, in the list of Romans enumerated by Claudius
Severus, a Greek, who lived from about 409 to 3 54 B.c. : namely Dio,
who deposed the Syracusan tyrant Dionysius, but who was in turn himself
assassinated.76 It is highly unlikely that the Dio mentioned here could
be Dio Chrysostom, the rhetor and philosopher who was exiled under
Domitian but later recovered imperial favor. The rest of the list consists
of only statesmen, so that Dio Chrysostom would be an exception, and
he was not really a "martyr" of opposition to the Empire.
Claudius Severus may very well have spoken of these figures in a
conversation in which he emphasized the common element that linked
them all together: the link between philosophy and a specific conception
of politics; that is to say, the hatred of tyranny. Dio had been a disciple of
Plato, and according to Plutarch,77 he practiced the philosophical virtues
of frankness of speech, greatness of soul, gravity, clemency toward his
enemies, and frugality. By deposing Dionysius, Dio brought freedom
back to Syracuse and abolished the tyranny, but he supported a middle
path between tyranny and democracy: a monarchy subject to laws,
THE I N NER CITADEL
which is the governmental program set forth in the Eighth Letter, attributed
to Plato.
Brutus, a Roman, was also a Platonist. He followed the tendency
which was fashionable in his time: that of Antiochus of Ascalon, strongly
tinged with Stoicism. Brutus had written treatises entitled " On Duty,"
" On Patience," and "On Virtue." He was both the assassin of Caesar and
the man who killed himself after having been defeated in the civil war
which followed Caesar's assassination. Like Dio, Brutus was an enemy of
tyranny, and he fought for public liberty.
In the eyes of Seneca, Cato was one of the rare incarnations of the
ideal of the Stoic Sage.78 Before his suicide, Cato discussed the Stoic
paradox according to which only the Sage is free. Then, he read Plato's
Phaedo. 79 His whole way oflife was that of a philosopher, who tried at the
same time to revive the rigorous life of the ancient Romans. He trained
himself for physical endurance, traveled on foot, went against current
fashions, affected disdain for money, and refused any form of connivery
or complicity with the exactions carried out by powerful Romans.
Brutus and Cato were republicans. Freedom, for them, was above all
that of the Senate: in other words, the right to govern of a ruling class
which opposed the arbitrariness of the tyranny of one man. Cato also
wished to introduce moral or philosophical rigor into the senatorial class.
Under the Empire, Thrasea and Helvidius dreamed of a return to the
ancient institutions of the Roman Republic; in other words, they wished
to restore political authority to the Senate. Both were Stoics, and within
the Stoic tradition-particularly in Epictetus80-they would remain as
examples of constancy, mental firmness, and indifference to indifferent
things. Epictetus himself knew this opposition to imperial power well,
thanks to his teacher Musonius Rufus, who had been closely linked to
Thrasea.
All these memories were awakened by the reign and the persecutions
of Domitian, as we can see from the numerous allusions to this somber
period which can be found in the letters of Pliny the Younger. With the
total change of atmosphere brought about by the accession of the emperor
Nerva, which was prolonged under his successors Trajan, Hadrian,
and Antoninus, both Senators and philosophers had the impression that
the Empire had somehow become reconciled with the spirit of these
supporters of the republican ideal and of Stoicism. This is certainly the
meaning of the remarks by Claudius Severus on the martyrs who gave
their lives in the fight against tyranny. 81
By evoking these almost legendary figures, Claudius Severus gave
Marcus Aurelius in His Meditations 299
Marcus a glimpse of the principles of political conduct (I, 1 4, 2) . It is to
Claudius, writes Marcus, that he owes the
fact of having had a representation of a State (politeia) in which the
laws are equal for all, administered on the basis of equality and
freedom of speech, and of a monarchy which respects the freedom
of its subj ects above all else.
The idea of a law that is equal for all goes back to the Eighth Letter,
attributed to Plato. The equality in question is geometrical, and it distributes
benefits to each person in accordance with his or her merit. This is
precisely the Aristotelian and Stoic definition of justice: it accords advantages
in proportion to merit.
The ideas of equal rights, of equal rights to speech, and of freedom had
been extremely closely linked since the most ancient period of Greek
democracy. However, when Tacitus, writing under the Empire, spoke of
the reconciliation between monarchy and freedom brought about by
Nerva, the idea of freedom had lost much of its content. It no longer
meant the citizen's possibility to participate unhindered in political life.
Rather, it included such notions as the protection and safety of individuals,
and individual freedom (the right to express oneself, for example, or
to move freely) . For the cities, it meant the possibility of preserving their
traditions and a certain degree of municipal autonomy; but above all, for
the Senate, it meant the ability to influence the Emperor's decisions to a
greater or lesser extent.
Claudius Severus taught the future sovereign that freedom is compatible
with monarchy, if one understands by "monarchy" a regime that
respects the laws and the citizens. In fact, since he was so close to the
Emperor Antoninus, who exercised this kind of moderate power himself,
Marcus could not fail to be familiar with this way of governing.
Claudius Severus thus did not cause Marcus to discover it; instead, he
probably revealed to him the historical roots of this conception of monarchy:
the opposition to tyranny of the philosopher-martyrs.
Claudius thus made Marcus aware of the principles of conduct that
must guide an enlightened monarch: respect for the law, recognition of
the rights of the Senate, attendance at its sessions, participation in its
deliberations, and recognition of the right to speak, not only for the
prince's council or the Senate, but also for simple citizens, when they
addressed the Emperor.
The ancient historians have given us some examples of the way Mar-
300 THE I N NER CITADEL
cus applied these principles. In order to finance the Danubian war, he
took the trouble to ask the public treasury for funds. It was not, as Cassius
Dio notes, 82 as if these funds were not at the Emperor's disposition; yet
Marcus insisted on acknowledging that they belonged to the Senate and
the Roman People. Speaking to the Senate, Marcus said:
We possess nothing of our own, and it is in your house that we live.
According to the Historia Augusta, 83 Marcus always deliberated with
his council before undertaking anything, whether in war or in peace; for
his motto was:
It is more just for me to follow the advice of my friends, than that
the multitude of my friends should follow my will alone.
Marcus was extremely careful to take the Senate's opinion into consideration.
He let the mime-writers criticize him openly. The historian
Herodian specifies that Marcus entertained all requests, and forbade his
guards to bar the way to people who wished to approach him. 84 The
Historia Augusta sums up Marcus' entire attitude in the following terms:
Toward the people, he behaved exactly as ifhe were acting in a free
State. 85
The portrait of Antoninus Pius which Marcus gives in Book I serves in
part to illustrate these principles of government. In a sense, it sketches the
features of the ideal prince, with whom the Emperor would like to
identify himself. We find a trace of this portrait in the Meditations (VI,
3 0), where Marcus exhorts himself not to become " Caesarized" and not
to let the imperial purple rub off on him: instead, he is to become a true
disciple of Antoninus. Marcus takes particular care to describe the moral
qualities that Antoninus showed in his way of governing, which Marcus
intended to imitate. When, after due reflection, Antoninus had made a
decision, he held firmly to it: he was identical in every circumstance. He
never abandoned a question without having examined it thoroughly. He
put up with people who reproached him unjustly. He never hurried, did
not listen to calumnies, and could fathom people's morals and actions
with penetrating acuity. He did not seek to humiliate; neither did he fear
nor scorn anyone. Nor was he a sophist: he led a simple life, and was
content with little with regard to his lodging, his clothing, his food, and
his household servants. He was patient and hardworking, loyal and con-
Marcus Aurelius in His Meditations 301
stant in his friendships. He tolerated being contradicted with great frankness,
and he was happy to hear a better solution proposed. He was pious,
but not superstitious.
In this initial portrait of the ideal prince, which was to be partially
taken up again in Book I, we note some forms of behavior that Marcus
often exhorts himself to practice throughout the Meditations: for instance,
to allow his counselors to have different opinions from his, and to agree
to their opinion if it is better (IV, 12; VIII, 1 6); not to humiliate people
(XI, 13, 2; XI, 18, 1 8); and to remain identical with himself throughout
his entire life (XI, 21).
In the middle of the Meditations, this portrait of Antoninus appears like
a foreign body; it is surprising that Marcus should have taken the time to
produce such a sketch, apparently so distant from the exhortations with
which he showers himself elsewhere. Yet its presence confirms an impression
we may already have received while reading the work: the
Meditations are addressed not only to Marcus the man, but to Marcus the
man who exercises the imperial function. Hence, the model of Antoninus
acquires a capital importance.
The features of Antoninus which are sketched in Book I (chapter 1 6)
are more numerous and more precise: they are both memories and
examples, and they often correspond to the canon of the ideal prince,
which philosophical reflection, in accordance with an immemorial tradition,
had attempted to formulate.86
Let us leave aside for the moment Marcus' remarks on his adoptive
father's moral qualities, and concentrate on some of the characteristic
political attitudes in this portrait.
First, as far as the relations between sovereign and people are concerned,
we find the rejection of all demagogy; a total lack of currying
popular favor or gratitude; disdain for vain glory; and the refusal of
acclamations. Antoninus knew when to keep a tight rein, and when to
slacken it; and he practiced rigorous justice, which meant "inflexibly
distributing to each person what was due to his or her merit."
More broadly, he was constantly attentive to the general needs of the
Empire, and he was extremely thrifty when it came to public expenditures.
People made fun of him for this, but he was very tolerant with
regard to such criticisms. In particular, he thought long and hard before
offering spectacles to the public, building monuments, or distributing
gifts. Above all, he thought about what it was right to do, and not about
the glory he could derive from his acts. He thus tried-without making a
show of it-to remain faithful to his ancestral customs.
Antoninus showed a great deal of gentleness in his way of governing;
302 THE I N NER CITADEL
there was nothing hard, inexorable, or violent about him. He used meticulous
care in resolving the most minor affairs, and in using foresight
with the utmost detail. Once he made a decision, he stuck to it, and
would not allow himself to be moved. He had few secrets. He listened
attentively to his counselors-traditionally called the "Emperor's
friends"-and he accorded them a great deal of freedom; yet he enjoyed
their company.
We can detect an implicit criticism of Antoninus' predecessors in this
portrait, and in particular of Hadrian.87 If the Emperor took the trouble
to emphasize that his adoptive father put an end to "the love of young
boys," this was certainly an allusion to what went on in the courts of
Trajan and Hadrian. If he insisted on the fact that Antoninus liked to stay
in the same place, this was probably in order to criticize Hadrian's many
trips to every corner of the Empire. When Marcus spoke of Antoninus'
prudent frugality with regard to expenditures incurred by organizing
spectacles and building monuments, he probably had in mind Hadrian's
prodigality and love of fine construction. Finally, Marcus probably intended
to contrast Antoninus' conservatism, and his wish to remain close
to ancestral customs-in other words, to old Roman traditions-with
Hadrian's innovations.
Marcus saw in Antoninus a true philosopher, comparable to Socrates,
who knew how to enjoy good things when they were present, and to
abstain from them when they were absent (I, 16, 3 0). He evokes Antoninus'
perfect and invincible soul (I, 1 6, 3 l), as well as the tranquil conscience
he displayed in his final hour (VI, 3 o, l 5) . We do not know if
Antoninus considered himself to be a philosopher, but it is quite remarkable
that at the moment of his death, he gave the following password to
the tribune of the praetorian cohort: Aequanimitas, or " Serenity"-a
word which lets us glimpse an entire philosophical attitude.88 In any
event, we have every reason to suppose that when it came to sketching
the portrait of his adoptive father, Marcus did not simply collect a few
edifying features. Rather, he expressed his adherence to a quite specific
way of governing: that of Antoninus. The Historia Augusta89 summarizes
this continuity as follows:
From the beginning of their reign, Marcus Aurelius and Lucius
V erus behaved in a manner which was so benevolent and close to
the people (civiliter), that no one had cause to miss the gentleness of
Antoninus.
Marcus Aurelius in His Meditations 3 03
"Don't wait for Plato's republic "
How ridiculous are these little men who play at being politicians,
and, as they think, deal with affairs of State like philosophers! Snotty
little men! Man, what must you do? Do what Nature asks you to do
in this very moment. Direct your will in this direction, if it is
granted you to do so, and don't look around to see whether anyone
will know about it. Don't wait for Plato's Republic! Rather, be
content if one tiny thing makes some progress, and reflect on the
fact that what results from this tiny thing is no tiny thing at all!
Indeed, who will change the principles upon which they guide
their lives? And yet, without a change in these principles, what else
is there but the slavery of people who moan as they pretend to
obey?
Go on, now, quote me some Alexander, some Philip, or some
Demetrius! Let them worry about whether they knew what Universal
Nature wanted, and if they educated themselves. But if they
were only acting, no one has condemned me to imitate them.
Don't push me into acting solemn (IX, 29) .
Who were these " ridiculous" and "snotty little men"? It is hard to say.
Perhaps they were people who considered themselves philosophers, and
criticized Marcus because he was not carrying out "great politics." The
continuation of the passage allows us to suppose that he was accused of
two things: first, he had not realized Plato's Republic. As the philosopher-emperor,
should he not refom1 the State completely, in accordance
with the principles of philosophy? Second, he had not, unlike Alexander,
Philip of Macedonia, or Demetrius Poliorcetes,90 the "taker of cities,"
carried out a politics of conquest, which would be glorious for him and
for the Empire.
No, replies Marcus: what is essential is to concentrate on present
political and moral action, however modest it may be. Do what Nature
(that is to say, reason) asks you to do in this very moment, and don't let
yourself be carried away by vast utopian views, to the point where you
believe you are in "Plato's Republic."
" Plato's Republic " was a proverbial expression, which had a very
precise meaning. It did not, properly speaking, designate the political
program set forth in the great philosopher's dialogue. Rather, more
generally, it referred to a state in which all the citizens would have
become philosophers, and therefore perfect. It was in this sense that
THE I N NER CITADEL
Cicero91 told how the Stoic Mucius Scaevola had pleaded the cause of
Rutilius Rufus "as it could have been pleaded in Plato's Republic "-in
other words, as if he were addressing only philosophers. Elsewhere,
Cicero says92 of Cato of Utica that he used to act as if he were living in
Plato's Republic, and not in the mud of Romulus. This is precisely what
Marcus means. It is extremely difficult to transform the human masses; to
change the values which fascinate them, and the opinions which cause
them to act; or to make philosophers of them. Unless one transforms
their way oflooking at things, completely changing the moral life of each
individual, any reform imposed without their consent would plunge
them into the slavery " of people who moan as they pretend to obey."
This is the eternal drama of humanity in general and of politics in particular.
Unless it transforms people completely, politics can never be
anything other than a compromise with evil.
Marcus wants to be lucid and realistic: he has no illusions about the
general conversion of humanity, or the possibility of imposing upon
people some ideal state. Yet this does not mean that nothing can be done.
Just as Stoic philosophers knew that they would never be sages, but
nevertheless attempted gradually to progress toward this ideal, so the
statesman knows that humanity will never be perfect; yet he must be
happy if, from time to time, he manages to achieve some slight progress.
After all, even slight progress is no minor achievement: moral progress,
however minimal, takes a lot of effort and, above all, has a great deal of
value; for no moral progress is ever slight.
We can perhaps find an example of Marcus' political practice in his
attitude toward gladiatorial combats. Stoic philosophy was hostile to such
spectacles, because they went against the personal human dignity of the
combatants. As Seneca wrote,93
It is a sacrilege to teach men how to inflict and receive wounds.
Man, a sacred thing for man, is nowadays killed out of sport and by
way of pastime.
It is therefore false, I might add, to maintain as does G. Ville94 that the
Stoics were hostile to such spectacles only because they were degrading
for the spectators, but that these philosophers completely ignored the
drama of the victims. This is another example of the prejudice of certain
historians, who persist in attempting to minimize the importance of the
reversal of values represented by Stoic philosophy. Unfortunately for
Marcus Aurelius in His Meditations 3 05
them, however, the texts are there and they cannot be avoided: as Seneca
says, Homo sacra res homini.
It would have been utopian to suppress the games, which were an
essential part of the people's life. Thus, when Marcus enrolled the gladiators
to fight on the Danube, and the spectacles at Rome were interrupted,
the people already began to murmur that the Emperor wanted to
convert them to philosophy by taking away their pleasures. 95 Be that as it
may, Marcus must have considered it a small but not negligible progress
to have achieved what we are told by the historian Cassius Dio:96
Marcus Aurelius was so averse to the killing that, at Rome, he
attended combats in which the gladiators fought like athletes, without
danger. For he did not allow them to be given sharp weapons,
but they had to fight with blunt ones, with buttons on the point.
No utopia, then, but a realistic view of the possibilities and limits of
human nature, and a political policy that had only precise and limited
obj ectives as its goal. Moreover, the philosopher-emperor rej ected any
form of prestige politics: he had to do what was ordered by reason " at
that very moment," and " not look around to see whether anyone will
know about it" (IX, 29, 4) .
It goes without saying that Marcus could be crushed by a comparison
with Alexander, Philip, or Demetrius (the person in question is Demetrius
Poliorcetes, the " taker of cities") . They were certainly great
conquerors, but Marcus could reply that they were also people dominated
by their passions. Stoic tradition-for instance, Epictetus (II, 13,
24)-opposed to their brute material power the spiritual and moral
power of Diogenes, who did not hesitate to speak frankly to them. This
is, moreover, the meaning of one of Marcus' Meditations, which expresses
an analogous idea (VIII, 3):
Alexander, Caesar, and Pompey: what are they compared to Diogenes,
Heraclitus, or Socrates? The latter saw realities, causes, and
matter; and the guiding principles of their souls were sufficient unto
themselves. As for the others: so much pillage!97 so many people
reduced to slavery!
Alexander, Philip, and Demetrius may have been great conquerors;
but did they know what Nature or universal Reason wanted? Were they
masters, not only of the world, but also of themselves? Or were they,
306 THE I N NER CITADEL
instead, nothing but "tragic actors"? In other words, were they people
who, by means of their conquests, were the cause of atrocious events,
worthy of being represented in a tragedy, and were they themselves
actors who took up false and solemn poses? Pace the "snotty little men"
to whom Marcus alludes, nothing can make him imitate them. He will
continue to do his job as an emperor and a true philosopher: that is to
say, by conforming at every instant to the will of Reason and Nature, not
with turgid solemnity but with simplicity.
For Marcus, philosophy does not propose a political program. Rather,
he expects that philosophy will form him and prepare him, by means of
the spiritual exercises which he performs, to carry out his political action
in a specific spirit and style. What one does matters less than the way in
which one does it. In the last analysis, the only true politics is ethics. It
consists, above all, in the discipline of action, which, as we have seen,
consists essentially in service to the human community, devotion to
others, and justice. Like the discipline of action, politics cannot be separated
from the great human and cosmic perspectives that are opened up
for us by our recognition of a transcendent universality-Reason or
Nature-which, by means of its harmony with itself, founds both people's
love for one another and their love for that Whole of which they
are the parts. It is hard not to think of the recent comments of Vaclav
Havel,98 as he discusses what he calls the "moral State " or the "spiritual
State ":
True politics-the only thing worthy of the name, and the only
thing I will consent to practice-is politics in the service of our
fellow man, and in the service of the community .... Its basis is
ethical, insofar as it is only the realization of the responsibility of all
toward all .... [It] is nourished by the certainty, conscious or unconscious,
that ... everything is inscribed forever; that everything is
evaluated elsewhere, somewhere " above us," in what I have called
"the memory of Being": it is that part which is indissociable from
the cosmos, from nature and from life which believers call God, and
to whose judgment all things are submitted .... To try to remain, in
all circumstances, courteous, just, tolerant, understanding; and at
the same time uncorruptible and infallible. In sum, to try and remain
in harmony with my conscience and with my better self.
CONC L U SION
At the beginning of this book I alluded to the extraordinary success
which Marcus Aurelius' Meditations have enjoyed throughout the centuries,
beginning with the first edition in the sixteenth century. How can
we explain this phenomenon? Why does this work continue, even today,
to fascinate us to such an extent? Perhaps one reason is the consummate
art with which the Emperor chiseled out his aphorisms. In the words of
Nietzsche:
A good saying is too hard for the teeth of time, and all the millennia
are not enough to consume it, although it serves as food for every
epoch. It is thus the great paradox of literature: the imperishable in
the midst of the changing, the food which always is appreciated, like
salt, and again like salt, it never becomes insipid. 1
Yet the nutritive substance which we find in this work is, as we have
seen, the Stoic system, as it was set forth by Epictetus. Is it possible that it
could still serve as spiritual nourishment for us, people of the modern
era?
Ernest Renan,2 for one, did not think so. For him, the Meditations
went beyond Epictetus, Stoicism, and all definitive doctrines:
Fortunately, the little box which contained the Meditations on the
banks of the Gran and the philosophy ofCarnonte was saved. There
came out of it this incomparable book, in which Epictetus was
surpassed: this manual of the resigned life, this Gospel of those who
do not believe in the supernatural, which has not been able to be
understood until our time. A true eternal Gospel, the Meditations
will never grow old, for it affirms no dogma. The Gospel has grown
old in some of its parts: science no longer allows the naive concep-
3 08 THE I N NER CITA D EL
tion of the supernatural which constitues its foundation. In the
Meditations, the supernatural is only a tiny, insignificant stain which
does not affect the wonderful beauty of the background. Science
could destroy God and the soul, but the Meditations would still
remain young with life and truth. The religion of Marcus Aurelius
is, like that of Jesus was at times, absolute religion: that which results
from the simple fact of a high moral conscience faced with the
universe. It is not of one race, nor of one country; no revolution,
no progress, no discovery will be able to change it.
These lines do an admirable job of describing the impression that may
be felt by Marcus' readers. They must, however, be qualified and made
more precise. Like many other historians who followed him, Renan was
wrong about the meaning which the famous dilemma " Nature or atoms"
had for Marcus. He thought it meant that Marcus was completely indifferent
to the dogmas of Stoicism (Nature) or of Epicureanism (atoms) .
According to Renan-and this, he thought, was the secret of the eternal
youth of the Meditations-Marcus discovered that the moral conscience
is independent of all theories about the world and of all definite dogmas,
" as if, " in Renan's words,3 "he had read Kant's Critique ef Practical Reason.
"
In fact, as I have noted, the meaning of this dilemma is entirely
different. In the first place, Marcus did not invent it: it was traditional
within the Stoic school. Moreover, the Stoics had elaborated this reasoning
in order to establish irrefutably that, even if Epicureanism were
true-a hypothesis which they excluded absolutely-one would still
have to live as a Stoic. In other words, one would still have to act in
accordance with reason, and consider moral good to be the only good,
even if, all around us, everything were nothing but chaos and chance.
Such a position does not imply skepticism-quite the contrary. Yet the
fact that the Stoics constructed such an argument is extremely interesting.
By imagining that their physical theories might be false, and yet people
would still have to live as Stoics, they revealed that which, in their eyes,
was absolutely essential in their system. What defined a Stoic above all
else was the choice of a life in which every thought, every desire, and
every action would be guided by no other law than that of universal
Reason. Whether the world is ordered or chaotic, it depends only on us
to be rationally coherent with ourselves. In fact, all the dogmas of Stoicism
derive from this existential choice. It is impossible that the universe
could produce human rationality, unless the latter were already in some
Conclusion
way present within the former. The essence of Stoicism is thus the
experience of the absolute nature of moral conscience and of the purity
of intention. Moral conscience, moreover, is only moral if it is purethat
is to say, if it is based upon the universality of reason, which takes
itself as an end, not in the particular interest of an individual or a state. All
Stoics, and not just Marcus Aurelius, could have subscribed to the twin
Kantian formulations of the categorical imperative:
Act only in accordance with the maxim which is such that you can
wish, at the same time, that it become a universal law.
Act as if the maxim of your action were, by your will, to be erected
as a universal law ofNature.4
We must not say, therefore, that "Marcus writes as though he had read
the Critique of Practical Reason, " but rather that Kant uses these formulas
because, among other reasons, he has read the Stoics.
With these qualifications, Renan was right to say that we find in the
Meditations the affirmation of the absolute value of moral conscience.
Can we speak of religion here? I do not think so. The word "philosophy"
is enough, I think, to describe the purity of this attitude, and we
ought to avoid mixing with philosophy all the vague and imprecise
implications, both social and mythical, which the notion of religion
brings with it.
An eternal Gospel? Renan thought that some parts of the Christian
Gospel had grown old, whereas the Meditations would always remain
young. And yet, are not some of Marcus' pages-the religious onesalso
very distant from us? Isn't it better to say that all gospels grow old, to
the same extent that they have been fashionable-in other words, to the
extent that they have reflected the myths and collective representations
of the time and milieu in which they were written? There are some
works, however-among them both the Gospel and the Meditationswhich
are like ever-new springs to which humanity comes to drink. If
we can transcend their perishable aspects, we can sense in them an
imperishable spirit which calls us to a choice oflife, to the transformation
of ourselves, and to a complete revision of our attitude with regard to
human beings and to the world.
The Meditations call us to a Stoic choice of life, as we have seen
throughout this book. This obviously does not mean that the work is
capable of leading us to a complete conversion to the dogmas and prac-
] IO THE INNER CITA D EL
tices of Stoicism. Yet, insofar as we attempt to give meaning to our lives,
the Meditations invite us to discover the transformation which could be
brought to our lives, if we were to realize-in the fullest sense of the
term-those specific values which constitute the spirit of Stoicism.
It could be said, moreover, that there is a universal Stoicism in humanity.
By this I mean that the attitude we call "Stoic " is one of the fundamental,
permanent possibilities of human existence, when people search
for wisdom. For instance, J. Gemet5 has shown how some aspects of
Chinese thought were related to what we call Stoicism. They obviously
developed without Greco-Roman Stoicism having exercised any
influence on them whatsoever. This phenomenon may be observed,
among other places, in Wang-Fou-chih,6 a Chinese philosopher of the
seventeenth century, who writes:
Vulgar knowledge (that which limits itself to what one has seen or
heard) is constituted in the egotism of the self and is far from the
" great objectivity" [ta kong, a term which has both a moral and an
intellectual meaning] .
We can glimpse that this "great objectivity" is entirely analogous to
Marcus' method of physical definition, which also consists in liberating
oneself from an egoistic point of view, and in placing oneself within the
perspective of universal Nature. As Gemet comments:
Morality and reason are one. Once the sage has enlarged his spirit to
the dimensions of the universe (ta sin: the exact equivalent of the
term megalopsuchia, or "greatness of soul") and "made his person an
object of the world," he is able to grasp the spirit of the " Great
Transformation"; that is, of the life of universal exchanges by which
the beat of the world is marked.
The sage's "great objectivity"-or, as we could say, the expansion of
his spirit to the dimensions of universal Reason-inspires a moral attitude
which is entirely Stoic. We can see this in the following passage
from Wang-Fou-chih:7
The good man waits for what destiny reserves for him, and is not
saddened by death. He uses his particular capacities as far as he can,
and develops the good dispositions of his nature [which is a reflec-
Conclusion 3 11
tion of the celestial principle of order] , so that he does not sm
against the relevant norms.
We can recognize another theme that we have encountered in Marcus
Aurelius in Tang Zhen, another Chinese philosopher of the same period
who has been translated by Gemet: the opposition between the puniness
of human beings, lost in the cosmos, and the transcendence of the moral
conscience, which makes it equal to the universe:
In the immensity of the space and time of the universe, man resembles
a speck of dust blown by the wind, or a tiny spark of light.
What makes him equal to it, however, is the perfection of his
fundamental goodness, and the nobility of his moral effort.8
Among the numerous attitudes which human beings can adopt with
regard to the universe, there is one which was called " Stoic " in the
Greco-Roman world, but which could be called by many other names,
and which is characterized by specific tendencies.
In the first place, the " Stoic," in the universal sense in which we
understand him, is conscious of the fact that no being is alone, but that
we are parts of a Whole, constituted by the totality of human beings as
well as by the totality of the cosmos. The Stoic constantly has his mind
on this Whole. One could also say that the Stoic feels absolutely serene,
free, and invulnerable, insofar as he has become aware that there is no
other evil than moral evil, and that the only thing that counts is the
purity of moral conscience.
Finally, the Stoic believes in the absolute value of the human person. It
is too often forgotten, and cannot be repeated too much, that Stoicism is
the origin of the modem notion of "human rights." I have already cited
Seneca's fine formula on this subject:9 "man is a sacred thing for man."
Yet how could I fail to cite also the remark ofEpictetus, when someone
asked him how he should put up with a clumsy slave (I, 13, 3):
You are the slave! So you can't put up with your brother, who has
Zeus as his ancestor, and who, as a son, was born from the same
seed as you and, like you, descends from on high ... Don't you
remember whom you are ordering around? Your kinsmen, your
brothers by nature, and progeny of Zeus.
-But I've got rights with regard to them because I bought them;
they don't have any with regard to me!
3 12 THE I N NER CITA D EL
-Can you see where you are looking? You see the earth, a pit,
and you see only these miserable laws, which are the laws of the
dead. Don't you look to the laws of the gods?
Epictetus uses the mythical, imagistic representation of the filiation of
all human beings from God, which may seem antiquated to a modem
audience. Yet when he talks about Zeus-and, as we have seen, the same
thing holds true of Marcus Aurelius-he is thinking first and foremost of
reason. What Epictetus means is simply the following: this slave is a living
being like you, and, like you, a man gifted with reason. Even if human
laws refuse to recognize that he is your equal, the laws of the gods, which
are the laws of reason, recognize his absolute value. We people of modem
times think that we have abolished these laws of the dead, but in the
last analysis they still dominate the world.
V. Goldschmidt10 was right to point out that another aspect of what
could be called " eternal Stoicism" is the exercise of concentration on the
present instant. This consists, on the one hand, in living as if we were
seeing the world for the first and last time; and, on the other, in being
aware that within this lived present of the instant, we have access to the
totality of time and of the world.
The reader may rightly object at this point: the fact that there is a kind of
universal, perennial character to this peculiar attitude which we call
" Stoic " may perhaps explain why, despite the distance which separates us
from them, we can still understand the Meditations, and, better yet, find
rules for our thought and action in them. Yet this doesn't explain the
unique fascination that they exert upon us. Could we not say that if this
book is still so attractive to us, it is because when we read it we get the
impression of encountering, not the Stoic system, although Marcus constantly
refers to it, but a man of good will, who does not hesitate to
criticize and examine himself, who constantly takes up again the task of
exhorting and persuading himself, and of finding the words which will
help him to live, and to live well? To be sure, these are spiritual exercises,
carried out in accordance with a specific method. Yet, in a sense, we are
present at them: we catch them in actu, in the very moment in which they
are being practiced.
In world literature one finds lots of preachers, lesson-givers, and censors,
who moralize to others with complacency, irony, cynicism, or
Conclusion 3 13
bitterness; but it is extremely rare to find a person training himself to live
and to think like a human being (V, I):
In the morning, when you have trouble waking up, let the following
thought be present to you: 'Tm getting up to do the job of a
human being."
One must admit that there are few hesitations, fumblings, or searchings
in these exercises which follow a canvas that Stoic philosophy and
Epictetus have drawn in advance with precision. The personal effort
appears rather in the repetitions, the multiple variations developed
around the same theme, and the stylistic effort as well, which always
seeks for a striking, effective formula. Nevertheless, we feel a highly
particular emotion when we enter, as it were, into the spiritual intimacy
of a soul's secrets, and are thus directly associated with the efforts of a
man who, fascinated by the only thing necessary-the absolute value of
moral good-is trying to do what, in the last analysis, we are all trying to
do: to live in complete consciousness and lucidity; to give each of our
instants its fullest intensity; and to give meaning to our entire life. Marcus
is talking to himself, but we get the impression that he is talking to each
one of us.

ro. It is true that the Christian apologist Justin, a contemporary of Marcus
Aurelius (cf Andre Wartelle, Saint Justin, Apologies [Paris, 1987), pp. 3 1-3 2) , at
the beginning of his Apology, gives the title of "philosophers" to Marcus Aurelius
and to Verus. Melito of Sardis, another apologist (cf Eusebius of Caesarea,
Ecclesiastical History IV, 26, 7) associates Commodus with the philosophical reputation
of his father, Marcus Aurelius. In both these cases, it was obviously
because of Marcus that his associates were dignified with this title. On the
notion of "philosopher" in the Imperial period, see the excellent work by
J. Hahn, Der Philosoph und die Gesellschajt (Stuttgart, 1 989) .

his eloquence and therefore nicknamed "the Siren"-is only emphasized in the
letter to Fronto which speaks of Marcus' "conversion" to philosophy in order
not to hurt Fronto's feelings. Fronto, on this hypothesis, would have been more
offended to hear of his rival Junius Rusticus or of the Discourses of Epictetus,
which Fronto's literary taste held in low esteem.

but the ancient rhetorico-philosophical discipline of topics (one thinks of the
works entitled "Topics" by Aristotle and Cicero) has been excellently defined as
follows by the Swiss philosopher A.-J. Voelke: "A discipline which permits the
orator to find what it is appropriate to say, in accordance with the situation in
which he finds himself, and the goal he has set himself In particular, topics
provided a repertoire of points of view, or places, susceptible of providing a basis
for a variety of forms of arguments." La Philosophie comme therapie de l' ame: Etudes

Translator's Note
The thought of Pierre Hadot is based on a lifetime's study of, and meditation
upon, ancient Greek and Latin philosophical texts. In the course of this long
period, he has, of course, developed his own methodology for the study of
such texts. Based as it is on the methods of his own teachers, such as Paul
Henry and Pierre Courcelle, 1 this method is distinctly his own, and he has
transmitted it to a whole generation of French scholars in the field of late
antique thought.
The first stage of Hadot's method is a scrupulous, textually critical reading of
the original texts, followed by an equally exacting translation of these texts into
French. 2 Only on the foundation of the intense, detailed confrontation with the
text which real translation demands, Hadot feels, can one begin the processes of
exegesis, interpretation, and, perhaps, criticism. Thus, Hadot's thought is, at least
to a large extent, based on his methods of translation. This being the case, it is
impossible to understand the former without understanding the latter.
Such a situation presents obvious difficulties for Hadot's translators. Given
the importance he accords to the study of ancient texts, Hadot tends to quote
them frequently and extensively, in his own translations from the Greek, the
Latin, and the German. Now, a translator's normal procedure would be to dig
up the already existing English translations of the respective texts, and insert
them where Hadot's own translations had stood in the original. After much
consultation, we have found this method inadequate, for the following reasons:
Many existing English translations are themselves inadequate; some are old
and outdated; others based on different textual readings from those
adopted by Hadot. In the case of still others, finally, no English translation
exists at all.
2 There is no such thing as an "objective translation." All ttanslators base their
work on their own conception of what their author was trying to say.
Naturally, Hadot has often arrived at views of what his authors meant which
differ from those of the various other ttanslators; his own translations
consequently differ, sometimes fundamentally, from the existing J<:nglish
versions.3
Translator's Note vii
3 The use of existing English translations would often make Hadot's thought
impossible to understand. If we were to insert, for example, a 60-year-old
English translation of, say, Marcus Aurelius into the text, and then follow
it with Hadot's explanation of the passage, the result would be ludicrously
incoherent. Most importantly, it would make it impossible for the reader
to gain any notion of the genesis and development of Hadot's thought -
which is, after all, the goal of this publication. As I have said, the origin
of Hadot's thought is to be sought in his interpretation of ancient texts,
and his translations of these texts are both the result and an integral part
of his hermeneutical method. Deprived of his translations, we could simply
not see how Hadot had arrived at his particular interpretations of particular
ancient texts, and consequently we would be at a loss to understand the
conclusions he has based on these interpretations.
This being the case, the method I have chosen to follow in the translation
of Spiritual Exercises is the following: in the case of each of Hadot's quotations
of passages in Greek, Latin, or German, I have begun by a simple English
translation of Hadot's French version. I have then checked the result against
the original Greek, Latin, or German. If the English translation of Hadot's
version, read on its own, then seemed to me to be a good translation of the
original text, I let it stand; if not, I modified it slightly, with two goals in mind:
first, to bring it into accord with modern English usage; secondly, to make sure
the English transmitted, as far as possible, all the nuances of the original
languages. In cases of particular difficulty, I have benefited from Hadot's
thoughtful advice and comments, partly by correspondence, and partly during
the course of a memorable stay at the Hadot's home in the summer of 1991.4
The resulting translations therefore often bear little resemblance to existing
English translation; this is especially so in the case of authors like Plato,
Marcus Aurelius, and Plotinus, to whom M. Hadot has devoted a lifetime
of study. Nevertheless, we have decided to include references to the
most accessible - not necessarily the best - extant English translations, in case
the interested reader should care to consult the ancient authors cited in this
hook.
Such a method is, obviously, more time-consuming than the usual slapdash
method of translation. My hope is that the result justifies the delays incurred:
I would like to think the result is a scholarly and above all faithful version of
1-lndot's thought.

for completely new translations of those thinkers who have particularly occupied
his attention: Plotinus, Marcus Aurelius, Marius Victorinus, etc.
3 This is so even in the case of so eminent a student of Plotinus, and so
conscientious a translator, as A.H. Armstrong. Although he, too, has devoted a
lifetime of careful study to Plotinus, he often reaches conclusions in the
interpretation of particular Plotinian passages which differ from those of Hadot.
The reason for this is not hard to seek: Plotinus is an extremely difficult author,
and his writings are susceptible of many different interpretations.

gratitude for the Hadots' wonderful hospitality.

Introduction: Pie"e Hadot and the Spiritual
Phenomenon of Ancient Philosophy
I believe it was in 1982 that Michel Foucault first mentioned Pierre Hadot to
me. Struck by Foucault's enthusiasm, I photocopied a number of Hadot's
articles, but, to my regret, never got around to reading them until several
years after Foucault's death. I immediately understood, and shared, Foucault's
excitement, for Hadot's work exhibits that rare combination of
prodigious historical scholarship and rigorous philosophical argumentation
that upsets any preconceived distinction between -the h1story--of phDosophy
and philosqphy proper. Expressed in a lucid prose whose clarity and precision
urc remarkable, Hadot's work stands as a model for how to write the history
of philosophy. This collection of essays will, I hope, help to make his work
better known in the English-speaking world; the depth and richness of his
writing contain lessons not only for specialists in ancient philosophy, but for
nil of us interested in the history of philosophical thought.
Pierre Hadot has spent most of his academic career at the Ecole pratique
dL•s Hautes Etudcs and at the College de France. Appointed a directeur d'etudes
of the fifth section of the Ecole in 1964, Hadot occupied a chair in Latin
Pntristics, where he gave extraordinary lectures, many of which remain
unpublished, on, among other topics, the works of Ambrose and Augustine.
In 1972, in response to Hadot's interest in and work on non-Christian
I houl{ht, the title of his chair was changed to "Theologies and Mysticisms of
I lcllcnistic Greece and the End of Antiquity." Hadot gave courses on Plotinus
111111 M11rcus Aurelius, but also began to devote increased attention to more
Ml'ncrnl themes in the history of ancient philosophical and theological thought.
In Fdnunry 1983 he assumed the chair of the History of Hellenistic and
Runum Thought at the College de France. He has published translations of
1111d ,·onu11cn111rics on Marius Victorinus, Porphyry, Ambrose, Plotinus, and
M111'l"llN AurdiuN. I liM CNNllYN on 11ncicnl philosophy rungc over virtually every

topic of major significance, and constitute nothing less than a general
perspective, both methodologically and substantively, on how to approach and
understand the development of the entire history of ancient thought. A
reading of Hadot's complete corpus of writings reveals, as one might expect,
important essays on the history of medieval philosophy, but also, perhaps
more surprisingly, brilliant" contributions to our understanding of Goethe,
Nietzsche, and Wittgenstein. Hadot has also been increasingly preoccupied
with the pertinence of ancient thought for philosophy today, recogmzing that
ancient experience raises questions that we cannot and should not overlook or
ignore.
This collection of essays is based on the second edition of Exercfres spiritue/s
el philosophic antique, originally published in 1987 and now out of print.1 But
it also includes a number of essays that were written subsequent to the book,
essays that take up, develop, and extend the themes of E:rercices spiritttels.
Moreover, Hadot has made revisions in some of the chapters for their
inclusion in this volume, and he has rewritten his discussion of Marcus
Aurelius in light of his commentary on the Meditations. 2 Thus this collection
represents an expanded discussion of the topics of spiritual exercises and
ancient philosophy.
In my introduction, I shall not summarize the individual essays. Rather, I
shall try to indicate the general orientation of Hadot's thought, as well as
relate these essays to other questions and problems - methodological,
historical, and philosophical - treated elsewhere by Hadot. Instead of
concentrating on questions of detail, I shall try to highlight some of the
philosophical lessons and insights offered to us by Hadot's work.
1 Method and Practices of Interpretation in the History of
Ancient Philosophy and Theology
In the summary of his work prepared for his candidacy at the College de
France, Hadot wrote:
The problems, the themes, the symbols from which Western thought
has developed were not all born, quite obviously, in the period that we
have studied. But the West has received them for the most part in the
form that was given to them either by Hellenistic thought, or by the
adaptation of this thought to the Roman world, or by the encounter
between Hellenism and Christianity.J
The historical period he has studied has led Hadot to be especially sensitive to the
ways in which different systems of thought - Jewish, Greek, Roman, and Christian -
have interacted with one another. At the end of antiquity, one is foccll with n
lnlroduction 3
vast phenomenon of transposition, a gigantic mela-phora in which all the
forms of structures, political, juridical, literary, philosophical, artistic, have
crossed over into new environments, have contaminated themselves with
other forms or structures, thus modifying, more or less profoundly, their
original meaning, or losing their meaning, or receiving a new meaning (which
sometimes is a "mistranslation") [contresens]}
For example, the development of a Latin philosophical language required the
adaptation of Greek models, so that to each term of this technical Latin
language corresponded a quite specific Greek term; but "on the occasion of
this translation many slippages of meaning, if not misinterpretations," were
produced.5 Furthermore, when it was a question of the philosophical and
theological exegesis by Latin Christian writers of biblical texts, additional
problems were posed by the presence of Latin versions of Greek versions of
the original Hebrew. Along with the misinterpretations brought about by
these translations, Christian writers added their own lack of understanding of
Hebraic ideas. Hadot gives the wonderful example of Augustine, who read in
the Latin version of Psalm IV: 9 the expression ;,, idipsum. Although the
Hebrew text contains wording that simply means "at this very moment" or
"immediately," Augustine, prompted by Neoplatonist metaphysics, discovers
in this in idipsum a name of God, "
the selfsame." He thus discovers here a
metaphysics of identity and divine immutability, interpreting the expression
as meaning "in him who is identical with himself." 6 Both a Latin translation
and a Neoplatonist metaphysics come between his reading and the text.
To take another example, in Ambrose's sermon De Isaac vel anima, we find
undeniable borrowings, indeed literal translations, from Plotinus; more specific11lly,
the use of texts from Plotinus that relate to the detachment from the body
11nd to the withdrawal from the sensible as a condition of contemplation. These
texts of Plotinian mysticism are joined to texts of Origenean mysticism that derive
from Origcn 's commentary on the Song of So11gs. But in this encounter between
Plotinian and Origenean mysticism, Plotinian mysticism loses its specificity. One
dues not find in Ambrose any important trace of what is essential to Plotinus'
thought, namely the surpassing of the intelligible in order to attain the One in
(.'CKtruly. Such texts concerning the mysticism of the One are translated by
Ambrose in such a way that they lose this meaning and arc related to the union
of lhe soul with the Logos. So Hadot speaks of "a Plotinian ascesis put in the
KC:f\' ice of an Origenean mysticism that is a mysticism of Jesus." 7 Thus Ambrose
nm identify the Good and Christ, since with respect to the Good he brings in
1'1aul'11 Colossians I: 20, which does indeed concern Christ. Yet, as Hadot remarks,
"thi11 idcntifiuation is absolutely foreign to the whole economy of the Plotinian
11yNtc:m." � Borrowings, ro1111·esms, the introduction of a logic into texts that had a
tlilfort<nl logic'' 1hi11 whole phenomenon is central to the development of
1111dm1 1huul(lll, 1md, 1111 I l11dot m11kc11 clear, not to ancient thought alone.
4 lntroduclion
In his essay "La fin du paganisme" Hadot examines the struggles,
contaminations, and symbioses between paganism and Christianity at the end
of antiquity. We can relatively straightforwardly reconstruct the philosophical
struggles and divergences; for instance, the claim on the part of pagan
polemicists that at the time of his trial and death Jesus did not behave like a
sage, the pagan philosophy of history that charged Christians with lacking
historical roots and that denied them the right to claim that their tradition
was the sole possessor of the truth, the pagan argument that the Christians
imagined God as a tyrant with unforeseeable whims who carries out completely
arbitrary and irrational actions, such as the creation of the world at a
specific moment of time, the election and then rejection of the Jewish people,
the incarnation, the resurrection, and, finally, the destruction of the world.1°
We can also discover in the pagan world certain attempts to assimilate
Christian elements, and even, in certain epochs, the phenomenon of symbiosis
between pagan and Christian thought. Thus, for example, the emperor
Alexander Severus used to render honor to certain portraits (effigies) of men
who, thanks to their exceptional virtue, had entered the sphere of divinity.
Among these men were Orpheus, Appollonius of Tyana, Abraham, and
Christ, and so the emperor made a place for Christ in his pantheon.11 In the
case of some individuals one could legitimately wonder whether they were
pagans or Christians. The Hymns of Synesius could be considered as having
been inspired by the Christian trinitarian doctrine or, on the contrary, as a
representative of a pagan theology that one could link to the tradition of
Porphyry .
12
More historically subtle is the process that Hadot has labeled "contamination,"
that is, "the process according to which paganism or Christianity were
lead to adopt the ideas or the behaviors characteristic of their adversary." 1
1
Such contamination, which could operate with different degrees of awareness,
extended from specific doctrines and behaviors to very general ideas and
institutions. Eusebius of Caesarea could bring together the doctrines of
Plotinus and Numenius on the First and Second God with the Christian
doctrine of the Father and the Son and their relations. 14 And the emperor
Julian could wish to impose the organization of the Christian church on
paganism, wanting the pagan church to imitate the Christian church's
activities. 15
Most important from a philosophical point of view, Christianity borrowed
the very idea of theology, its methods and principles, from paganism. As
Hadot has shown, both pagans and Christians had an analogous conception
of truth; truth was an historical reality of divine origin, a revelation given by
God to humanity at a particular time. As a consequence, their conceptions of
philosophy and theology were identical - "human thought could only be
exegetical, that is, it must try to interpret an initial datum: the revelation
contained in myths, traditions, the most ancient laws." 11' Not only wns
Introduction 5
Christianity contaminated by the pagan idea of theology, but the ancient
Christian idea of hierarchical monotheism, so central to early Christianity,
could be found within the evolution of paganism itself, especially under the
influence of the imperial ideology. The conceptions of monotheism and
hierarchy that served to define the Byzantine Christian world were thus also
contaminations from the pagan world; indeed, these ideas could be said to
sum up the entire essence of late paganism. 1
7 These contaminations inevitably
led to distortions, deformations, misunderstandings of all kinds, but the
overlap and intersections brought about by these contaminations also led to
the evolution of thought, the development of fresh ideas, the creation, by way
of creative misinterpretations, of new concepts, categories, arguments, and
conclusions.
In the first century BC, as a consequence of the destruction of most of
the permanent philosophical institutions in Athens (which had existed
from the fourth to the first century BC), the four great philosophical
schools - Platonism, Aristotelianism, Epicureanism, and Stoicism - could
no longer be supported by the Athenian institutions created by their
founders.
In order to affirm their fidelity to the founder, the four philosophical
schools, scattered in different cities of the Orient and Occident, can no
longer depend on the institution that he had created, nor on the oral
tradition internal to the school, but solely on the texts of the founder.
The classes of philosophy will therefore consist above all in commentaries
on the text.'8
The exegetical phase of the history of ancient philosophy was characterized
hy the ract that the principal scholarly exercise was the explication of a text.
Exeietical philosophy conceived of the philosopher not as a "solitary thinker
who would invent and construct his system and his truth in an autonomous
way. The philosopher thinks in a tradition." 19 For the philosopher during this
period, truth is founded on the authority of this tradition, and it is given in
fhc texts of the founders of the tradition.
Perhaps the most extraordinary instance of the weight and pressures of
nc:gctical thought is to be found in the example, extensively discussed by
I l1ulot, of the appearance of the distinction between "being" as an infinitive
(111 1•11mi) and "being" as a participle (to on). In a series of articles Hadot has
"lu1wn thnt this distinction arose as a result of the need to give a coherent
L'Xcgc:11i11 of Plato's second hypothesis in the Parmenides, "If the one is, how is
II 1m1111iblc that it should not participate in being [ 011sia ]?" 20 The Neoplatonist
exegesis of the Parmtnitles required that each of Plato's hypotheses correspond
to 11 diflcrcnt hypo11ta11ili; thui;, thi11 S'-'C<>nd hypothesis corresponded to the
llL'L'otul ( >nc:. Since thi11 11ccond One mui;t 1>articipate in 011sia, and since by
6 Introduction
"participation'' the Neoplatonists meant "receiving a form from a superior
and transcendent Form," the second One's participation in ousia is understood
to be participation in an ousia in itself which transcends the participating
subject. However, according to good Neoplatonist doctrine, above the
second One there is only the first One, and this first One, absolutely simple,
cannot be an ousia. The first ousia must be the second One. So how could
Plato have spoken of an ousia that precedes the second One? An anonymous
Neoplatonist commentator on the Parmenides, whom Hadot has identified as
Porphyry, squarely confronted these difficulties: "influenced by the exegetical
tradition characteristic of his school, the words of Plato evoked for him the
entities of a rigid system, and the literal text became reconcilable only with
difficulty with what he believed to be Plato's meaning."21 Porphyry's solution
to this difficulty would consist in presenting an exegesis according ·to which
Plato had employed the word ousia in an enigmatic way, instead of another
word whose meaning is close to the word ousia, namely the word einai. If
Plato speaks of an ousia in which the second One participates, he wants it to
be understood that the second One receives the property of being a "being"
(to on} and of being "ousia" from the first One, because the first One is itself
"being" (to einai} "not in the sense of a subject but in the sense of an activity
of being, considered as pure and without subject. "22 Thus, as Hadot shows,
we can see appear for the first time in the history of onto-theology a
remarkable distinction between being as an infinitive and being as a participle.
Being as an infinitive characterizes the first One, pure absolutely indeterminate
activity, while being as a participle is a property of the second One, the
first substance and first determination that participates in this pure activity.
This distinction arises from the formulation used by Plato at the beginning
of the second hypothesis of the Parmenides, joined to the Neoplatonist
exegesis of the Parmenides and the need for Porphyry to try to explain, from
within this system of exegesis, why Plato said what he did. 21 The result,
according to Hadot, was "certainly a misinterpretation, but a creative
misinterpretation, sprung from the very difficulties of the exegetical
method."24 This creative misunderstanding was to have a profound influence
on the development of a negative theology of being, and, by way of Boethius'
distinction between esse and id quod est, was decisively to affect the history of
Western philosophical thought.25
As early as 1959, Hadot described a phenomenon, constant in the history
of philosophy,
that stems from the evolution of the philosophical consciousness: it is
impossible to remain faithful to a tradition without taking up again the
formulas of the creator of this tradition; but it is also impossible to use
these formulas without giving them a meaning that the previous
philosopher could not even have suspected. One then sincerely bclicvt'!I
Introduction
that this new meaning corresponds to the deep intention of this
philosopher. In fact, this new meaning corresponds1 to a kind of
possibility of evolution of the original doctrine.26
7
Not all such bestowals of new meaning are creative misunderstandings, as
Hadot well realizes. But some of them have led to new ideas of great
philosophical significance. We must study the history of these exegeses,
discover how these misunderstandings have been used, what philosophical
consequences and what paths of evolution have resulted from them, in order
to determine whether they have indeed been creative. In the most interesting
of cases, we may find that a history of misinterpretation and a history of
philosophical creativity are intimately linked.27
In his inaugural lecture to the College de France, Hadot writes:
It seems to me, indeed, that in order to understand the works of the
philosophers of antiquity we must take account of all the concrete
conditions in which they wrote, all the constraints that weighed upon
them: the framework of the school, the very nature of phi/osophia,
literary genres, rhetorical rules, dogmatic imperatives, and traditional
modes of reasoning. One cannot read an ancient author the way one
does a contemporary author (which does not mean that contemporary
authors are easier to understand than those of antiquity). In fact, the
works of antiquity are produced under entirely different conditions than
those of their modern counterparts.2JI
Hadot's studies of the history of ancient philosophy and theology have always
included the analysis of "the rules, the forms, the models of discourse," the
framework of the literary genre whose rules are often rigorously codified, in
which the thoughts of the ancient author are expressed.29 Such analysis is
necessary in order to understand both the details of the work, the exact import
of particular statements, as well as the general meaning of the work as a whole.
Literary structure and conceptual structure must never be separated. 30
Describing his method of study for Latin Patristics, Hadot has invoked an
exceptionally illuminating analogy, comparing what happens in these studies
lo what takes place in those curious paintings where
one secs at first sight a landscape that seems to be composed normally.
One thinks that if there is, in such and such a place in the picture, a
house or a tree it depends solely on the imagination of the artist. But if
nnc looks at 1he whole painting from a certain angle the landscape
1r111111form11 it11clf into 11 hidden figure, a face or a human body, and one
11mlcr11t11nll11 then th11t the hou11t• or the tree wa11 not there out of pure
8
fancy, but was necessary because it made up part of the hidden figure.
When one discovers the structure or the fundamental form of a text, one
has an analogous experience: certain details that seemed to be there only
in an arbitrary way become necessary, because they make up an integral
part of the traditional figure used. And just as one can contrast or
compare the sense of the face and the sense of the countryside, one can
compare the meaning of the traditional form or structure, considered in
themselves, and that of the text which has borrowed them ... We often
have the impression when we read ancient authors that they write badly,
that the sequence of ideas lacks coherence and connection. But it is
precisely because the true figure escapes us that we do not perceive the
form that renders all the details necessary . .. once discovered, the
hidden form will make necessary all of the details that one often believed
arbitrary or without importance.31
This description brilliantly captures the significance of placing the work
studied in the framework of its literary genre, the transformation in understanding
brought about when one moves from the insignificant and arbitrary
to the meaningful and necessary. Hadot's methodological prescriptions
can be fruitfully applied at virtually every level in the analysis of ancient
thought.
I want to consider briefly a series of examples not taken up ·by Hadot in
order to emphasize the depth and accuracy of his analogy. I have in mind the
extraordinary work on mystical cryptography undertaken by Margherita
Guarducci. By carefully delineating the historical and geographical context
and by discovering "a coherent and rational system," 32 Guarducci was able to
show that certain ancient graffiti, both pagan and Christian, contained hidden
and almost dissimulated thoughts of a philosophical and religious character.33
The situation that results is precisely one in which phenomena that were
neglected or unacknowledged now assume a profound significance. So, for
example, she has demonstrated that the letters PE, the two initial letters of
the name Petrus, sometimes take on the form of the characteristic monogram
t or l that this monogram represents the keys of the first vicar of Christ,
and that the monogram sometimes even visually resembles, with the three
teeth of the E adjoined to the P, a key - t.34 Peter's monogram can also be
adjoined to a monogram for Christ Cf>. so that we find on wall g of the
Vatican this kind of graffiti, fl, expressing the indissoluble union of Peter
and Christ.35 By unraveling the rational and coherent system formed by this
mystical cryptography she can show that an inscription that previously found
no plausible explanation can be clearly and convincingly explained. Thus the
inscription found on a tomb (and shown in plate 1.1) wishes life in Christ and
Peter to the deceased. The bi valence of the Greek rho and the Latin pi is used
to superpose the monogram of Christ <£) with the letters PE thus forming,
Introduction 9
f which is inserted within the preposition in.36 Just as Hadot has described it,
these are cases where "once discovered, the hidden form will make necessary all
of the details that one often believed arbitrary or without sigrtificance." 37
This mystical cryptography can also be found in the pagan world, where a
form that can seem to be intrinsically insignificant is transformed, once the
hidden figure is discovered, into the expression of a philosophical doctrine.
Thus not only did the Pythagoreans recognize in the letter Y the initial letter
of the word vriera and therefore the concept of "salvation"; they also used
this letter to represent graphically the ancient concept of the divergent paths
of virtue and vice, the doctrine that life presented a forking path and that one
must choose between the path of virtue on the right, which will lead to peace,
and the path of vice on the left, where one will fall into misery.38 A funereal
stcle, datable f�om the first century AD, of a deceased man named "Pythagoras"
exhibits a large Y that divides the stone into five sections (shown in plate
1.2). Each section contains various scenes inspired by Pythagorean doctrine.
In the center is an image of the deceased (or perhaps of his homonym,
Pythagoras of Samo); to the right arc scenes personifying virtue, to the left
arc scenes personifying dissoluteness. Guarducci concludes that it is "easy to
recognize in the succession of these scenes that which the literary sources have
handed down to us ... : the Pythagorean Y, symbol of the divergent paths of
virtue and of vice, one of which brings ... eternal pleasure, the other ...
definitive ruin." ·19 Ir is indeed easy to come to this recognition, once one has
uncovered and deciphered the genre of mystical cryptography. But if one fails
to perceive the rigorously codified rules, one will see nothing of importance,
one will be forced to resort to lapidary error and accident to explain away
various features, one will find no coherence in many of the inscriptions."° The
diff crence between recognizing profound significance and trivial error or
arbitrariness will depend on whether the true form has escaped us or has
transformed our understanding.41
One might well imagine that the endeavor to hide religious and philosophical
thoughts within inscriptions and graffiti would require that we discover the
hidden form necessary to give coherence and sense to these graffiti. But one
might also assume that when we are confronted with extended philosophical
writing, andcnt texts, like many modem ones, will exhibit their structure more
or less on the surface. And then when we fail to discern this strm .. ture, we
conclude, as Hadot remarks, that ancient authors "write badly, that the sequence
of ideas lacks coherence and conncction."42 That the assumption on which this
conclusion is based is false, that the structure of even extended ancient
rhilosophical texts may not lie easily open to view, is clearly shown by Harlot's
own discuvcry of the underlying structure or fundamental form of Marcus
Aurelius' Mt'tlitfltim1s. Indeed, Hadot's description of the experience of seeing a

10 Introduction
., .
'i!:�,(:
.. -.: .
The first printed edition of Marcus Aurelius' Meditations appeared in 1559,
accompanied by a Latin translation. The editor, "Xylander" (Wilhelm
Holzmann), faced with what he saw as the total disorder of the text,
conjectured that the Meditations, as presented in the manuscript he edited,
were only disconnected extracts from the work of Marcus Aurelius, that
Marcus' book had reached us in a mutilated, incomplete, disordered state.43
This conjecture was taken up again in 1624 by Caspar Barth, who,
recognizing that one could detect traces of organization and sometimes
lengthy reasoning in the Meditations, claimed that the text that had reached
us consisted only of extracts from a vast, systematic treatise of ethics that the
emperor had written."" Such conjectures, and their variations, have accompanied
the Medi1atio11s throughout its history, always trying to account for the
disorder and haphazardousness of this work.45 The contemporary reader may
find individual aphorisms that seem to speak for themselves, but will be left
with the basic impression that, as Hadot puts it, "these sentences seem to
follow one another without order, with the randomness of the impressions and
states of soul of the emperor-philosopher."46
Hadot has recognized that Marcus Aurelius' Meditations belong to the type
of writing known as h_ypomnemata, personal notes and reflections written day
to day. This kind of writing existed throughout antiquity, and at least two of
Marcus' seventeenth-century editors and translators also recognized his work
Introduction 11
as consisting of personal notes.47 Marcus wrote day to day without trying to
compose a work intended for the public; his Meditations arc for the most part
exhortations to himself, a dialogue with himself. 4H Moreover, his thoughts and
reflections were written down according to "a very refined literary form,
hccause it was precisely the perfection of the formulas that could assure them
their psychological efficacy, their power of persuasion." 49 Thus, although
Marcus' work belongs to the literary genre of personal notes written day to
dny (�l'Pomne111att1), they are also quite distinct from other examples of such
notes. As Hadot concludes, "it appears indeed that unlike other /1ypomnemt1lt1,
the Metlilt1lions of Marcus Aurelius are 'spiritual exercises,' practiced accordinl(
to a certain method." 50
Spiritual exercises arc practiced in the Meditations according to a method,
I ludot has written, "as rigorous, as codified, as systematic as the famous
Spirit11t1/ E.l'ercises of Saint Ignatius." 51 And the key to this method, and thus
111 the Metlitt1tio11s, is to be found in the three philosophical topoi distinguished
hy Epictetus. Epictetus distinguished three acts or functions of the soul -
iudl(tnent, desire, and inclination or impulsion. Since each of these activities
11f' 1hc soul depends on us, we can discipline them, we can choose to judge or
11111 111 judl(c ;1nd to judge in a particular way, we can choose to desire or not
lo llcHirc, to will en· not to will. And so to each of these activities corresponds
11 r.pirit 11111 exercise, n discipline of representation and judgment, a discipline
111 1h·Nil'l'i nnd 11 lliNciplinc of inclin111ions or impulses to action.
12 Moreover,
12 Introduction
Hadot has shown that Epictetus identified the three disciplines with the three
parts of philosophy - the discipline of assent with logic, the discipline of
desire with physics, and the discipline of inclinations with ethics.53 And he
used the word topos "to designate the three lived exercises that ... are in a
certain way the putting into practice of the three parts of philosophical
discourse."54 Thus Epictetus' three topoi are three lived spiritual exercises.
Marcus Aurelius took up these three topoi and employed them as the
underlying structure of his Meditations. They are the key to the interpretation
of virtually the entire work, and our recognition of their role allows the
surface disorder of the Meditations to transform itself, so that we see beneath
this apparent lack of order a rigorous underlying form or structure:
beneath this apparent disorder hides a rigorous law that explains the
content of the Meditations. This law is, moreover, expressed clearly in a
ternary schema that reappears often in certain maxims. But this schema
was not invented by Marcus Aurelius: in fact it corresponds exactly to
the three philosophical topoi that Epictetus distinguishes in his Discourses.
It is this ternary schema that inspires the whole composition of the
Meditations of the emperor. Each maxim develops either one of these
very characteristics topoi, or two of them, or three of them.5s
These three disciplines of life are truly the key to the Meditations of
Marcus Aurelius. It is in fact around each of them that the different
dogmas ... are organized, are crystallized. To the discipline of judgment
are linked the dogmas that affirm the freedom of judgment, the
possibility that man has to criticize and modify his own thought; around
the discipline that directs our attitude with regard to external events are
gathered all the theorems on the causality of universal Nature; lastly, the
discipline of action is nourished by all the theoretical propositions
relative to the mutual attraction that unites reasonable beings.
Finally, one discovers that behind an apparent disorder, one can
uncover, in the Meditations, an extremely rigorous conceptual system.56
Each maxim, aphorism, sentence of the Meditations is an exercise of actualization
and assimilation of one or more of the three disciplines of life. 57 Thus
Hadot, discovering the form "that renders all the details necessary," allows us
to read the Meditations coherently, transforms our experience from that of
reading a disconnected journal to one of reading a rigorously structured
philosophical work.sx
Hadot's discovery of the ternary schema underlying the Meditations not
only allows us to give structure to its merely apparent disorder. It also allows
us to keep from falling into misplaced psychological judgments about the
author of these spiritual exercises. Precisely because the Meditatitms arc
Introduction 13
traditional Stoic spiritual exercises, we must be very prudent about drawing
conclusions concerning the personal psychological states of iyiarcus. As Hadot
has said, we are all too ready to project our own attitudes and intentions on
ancient works, to see the Meditations as the spontaneous effusion of Marcus'
everyday feelings, to see Lucretius' On the Nature of Things as the work of an
anxious man attempting to combat his anxiety, or to understand Augustine's
Confessions as the expression of his desire to confess and so to give us an
autobiographical account of his life.59 But in antiquity,
the rules of discourse were rigorously codified: in order to say what one
wanted to say, an author had to say it in a certain way, according to
traditional models, according to rules prescribed by rhetoric and philosophy
... [the Meditations] are an exercise realized according to .definite
rules; they imply ... a pre-existent outline which the emperorphilosopher
can only amplify. Often, he only says certain things because
he must say them in virtue of the models and precepts that impose
themselves on him. One will therefore only be able to understand the
sense of this work when one has discovered, among other things, the
prefabricated schemata that were imposed on it.60
Hadot has charted all of the supposed psychological portraits of Marcus
drawn from the Meditations, which see him as suffering from gloomy
resignation, extreme skepticism, despair. Some modern authors have claimed
to find in the Meditations evidence of a gastric ulcer and its psychological
consequences, or of the psychological effects of Marcus' abuse of opium.61 But
all of these attempts at historical psychology ignore the mechanisms of literary
composition in antiquity, and fail to take into account Marcus' modes of
thought, the fact that he was practicing spiritual exercises, derived from
Stoicism, more particularly from Epictetus, whose essential goal is to influence
himself, to produce an effect in himself.62
Take, for example, the repeated claims that the Meditations show us
that Marcus was a pessimist. After all, he does write things such as the
following:
Just like your bath-water appears to you - oil, sweat, filth, dirty water,
all kinds of loathsome stuff - such is each portion of life, and every
substance.6.1
These foods and disht>s ... arc only dead fish, birds and pigs; this
Falcrnian wine is a bit of grape-juice; this purple-edged toga is some
sheep's luiirs dipped in the blood of shellfish; as for sex, it is the rubbing
to[(cthcr of pieces of gut, followed by the spasmodic secretion of a little bit
of slime. 111
14 Introduction
What are these remarks, if not the expression of Marcus' characteristic
pessimism? In each of these cases of supposed pessimism, Hadot has been able
to show specifically that Marcus was not giving us his personal impressions,
that he was not expressing a negative experience that he had lived, but was
rather "exercising himself, spiritually and literarily." 65 Marcus is, first of all,
practicing the Stoic discipline of giving physical definitions which, adhering
to the objective representation of the phenomenon, are employed "to dispel
the false conventional judgements of value that people express concerning
objects." 66 Marcus writes:
always make a definition or description of the object that occurs in your
representation, so as to be able to see it as it is in its essence, both as a
whole and as divided into its constituent parts, and say to yourself its
proper name and the names of those things out of which it is composed,
and into which it will be dissolved.67
This kind of definition is intended to strip representations of "all subjective
and anthropomorphic considerations, from all relations to the human point of
view," thus defining objects, in a certain way, scientifically and physically.68
Such definitions belong both to the discipline of judgment, or logic, and to
the discipline of desire, or physics. The critique of representations and the
pursuit of the objective representation are, obviously enough, part of the
domain of logic; but these definitions can only be realized if one places oneself
in "the point of view of physics, by situating events and objects in the
perspective of universal Nature." h9
Marcus is not giving us his personal perception of reality, from which we
may then deduce conclusions about his sensibility or characteristic dispositions.
He is rather employing various means to transform himself, to acquire
a certain inner state of freedom and peace. To do so he must overcome
"solidly rooted prejudices, irrational terrors," employing all the means
available to him.m Here is how Hadot describes the ultimate goal of these
physical definitions:
This spiritual exercise of "physical" definition has exactly the effect of
rendering us indifferent before indifferent things, that is, of making us
renounce making differences among things that do not depend on us,
but which depend on the will of universal Nature. No longer to make
differences is therefore, first of all, to renounce attributing to certain
things a false value, measured only according to human scale. This is
the meaning of the apparently pessimistic declarations. But to no longer
make differences is to discover that all things, even those which seem
disgusting to us, have an equal value if one measures them according to
the scale of universal Nature, that is, looks at things with the same vision
Introduction
that Nature looks at them . . .. This inner attitude by which the soul
does not make differences, but remains indifferent �efore things,
corresponds to magnanimity of the soul [grandeur J'time).11
15
Thus with respect to the issue of Marcus' pessimism, we see the importance
of placing the Meditations in its literary and philosophical context. Abstracting
from this context leads to an improper psychology, and to an uncreative
misreading of the force of the Meditations, ignoring its basic philosophical
aims and procedures. Hadot diagnoses, with great insight, the dangers of
historical psychology:
We have here a fine example of the dangers of historical psychology
applied to ancient texts. Before presenting the interpretation of a text,
one should first begin by trying to distinguish between, on the one hand,
the traditional elements, one could say prefabricated, that the author
employs and, on the other hand, what he wants to do with them. Failing
to make this distinction, one will consider as symptomatic formulas or
attitudes which are not at all such, because they do not emanate from
the personality of the author, but are imposed on him by tradition. One
must search for what the author wishes to say, but also for what he can
or cannot say, what he must or must not say, as a function of the
traditions and the circumstances that are imposed on him.72
That the temptation to read ancient texts as expressions of their author's
psychological states and character is extremely difficult to overcome is shown by
the development of Hadot's own interpretation of Augustine's Confessions. In a
widely cited paper, originally delivered in 1960, Hadot concludes his discussion
of the development of the notion of the person with the claim that in Augustine's
Co11fossions, "the modem self rises into view in history." 73 Citing various passages
from Augustine on the mystery of the self, and following Groethuysen's
interpretation, Hadot is led to conclude, on the basis of these passages, that "With
Augustine the 'I' makes its entry into philosophical reasoning in a way that
implies a radical change of inner perspective. " 7� Hadot came little by little to
realize, however, that one must not be misled by Augustine's use of "I," that "the
autobiographical part of the Confessions is not as important as one might
believe." 75 The "I" of Augustine's Confessions continues the "I" of Job, David,
or Paul, that is, Augustine "identifies himself with the self who speaks in the
Scriptures. Ultimately the human sell who speaks in the Bible is Adam, a sinner
without doubt, but converted by God and renewed in Christ." 76 Thus, following
Pierre Courcelle, Hadot recognizes that the Confessions is essentially a theological
work, in which each scene may assume a symbolic meaning. So "in this literary
genre ... il is extremely d ifficult to distinguish between a symbolic enactment
nml 1111 11ccoun1 of 11 hiKloricnl event." 77
16 Introduction
Hadot therefore insists on the theological significance, in the first part of
Book II of the Confessions, of the images used by Augustine in order to
describe his inner state.78 And in the second part of Book II, when Augustine
recounts at length his adolescent theft of pears, we are in fact confronted with
a theological account concerning original sin. The "psychology of Augustine
the sinner is reconstructed from the ideal psychology of Adam, disobedient
to God in order to imitate, in a perverse way, the divine freedom."7'l Rather
than using this scene to draw a psychological portrait of Augustine the
individual, Hadot understands it as part of an anti-Manichean theological
polemic. Here is his interpretation, which is a model of how to avoid the
excesses of historical psychology when reading ancient texts:
the psychological and theological problem of original sin is posed on the
occasion of Augustine's theft, and we find ourselves once again in an
anti-Manichean problematic: in stealing the pears, as Adam stealing the
forbidden fruit, Augustine did not desire the fruit itself, that is, an
existing reality; rather he desired evil itself, that is, something that
doesn't have any substance. How is this possible? After having posed
the problem at length (4, 9-6, 1 3), Augustine responds by showing that
he had loved something "positive" in the evil: to imitate the freedom of
God, but in a perverse way. Every sin appt."llrs thus as an upside-down
imitation of the divine reality.1111
Instead of engaging in a psychological interpretation of Augustine's adolescence,
Hadot's reading allows us to sec that we arc in the presence of a
theological discussion of the nature of sin, and that Augustine's lengthy
recounting of his theft is not autobiographically motivated, but is necessary
in order for us to see the way in which sin is a perverse imitation of divine
reality.
Moreover, by placing the Confessions within the Christian exegetical
tradition, Hadot is able to show that the last three books of the Confessions, in
which Augustine seems to abandon autobiography to devote himself to
exegesis, far from being foreign to the rest of the work, do not ultimately have
"a different object from the account that is narrated in the biographical
part." 81 Hadot demonstrates that Augustine very often brings together the
two states of his soul - obscurity, then light - with the two states of the earth
at the beginning of the account of Genesis. In its first state the earth was
invisibilis and incomposita, and in its second state it received the illumination
of the Fiat lux.82 In Book II, Augustine presents his adolescence as a state of
obscurity and bubbling fluidity, and Hadot has shown that in this description
one can recognize "the vocabulary employed in Book XIII of the Crmfessions
to describe the chaos of Gen 1, 2."83 Furthermore, in Book XIII the images
of darkness and fluctuation serve precisely to describe "the state of the soul
Introduction 17
still 'formless,' before its conversion to God." M Thus Hadot can claim that
"the idea of the passage of the creature from a formless s ate to a state of
formation and of conversion dominates the whole work." 85 n Book XIII the
biblical account of creation becomes the description of the phases and stages
of the salvation of humanity.86 Putting together Augustine's autobiographical
and exegetical descriptions, Hadot can demonstrate the inner unity of the
work, the fact that for Augustine "Genesis is . . . the account produced by the
Holy Spirit of the conversion of the soul, as the Confessions is the account that
he himself produces of his own conversion." 117 Hadot therefore warns us that
we must interpret this text in light of the literary genre to which it belongs,
the tradition of exegesis of Ambrose and Origen, and that we will commit a
misunderstanding if we believe we have discovered the self "already" in the
Crmfessions.Hll We find in Hadot's own interpretation of Augustine the initial
outline of a kind of historical psychology, one that discovers in the Confessions
the beginnings of the modern self. However, this is followed by a more
detailed attention to the mechanisms of literary composition and to the
theological genre of the Confessions, an attention that both prevents the
apparent autobiography from becoming the philosophical center of the work
and permits us to see the unity between the first ten books and the last three.
There is, of course, a self to be found in the Confessions, but "it must not be
understood as the incommunicable singularity of the man Augustine, but, on
the contrary, as universal humanity of which the events of the life of
Augustine are only the symbols."89
Hadot's insistence on not separating conceptual structure from literary
structure also played a significant role in his interpretation of Wittgenstein's
work. As far as I have been able to determine, Hadot presented the first
detailed discussions in French of Wittgenstein's books, reviewing everything
from the Tractalus Logico-Philosophicus to the Philosophical Investigations and
Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics.'m In his 1959 discussion of
the later Wittgenstein, Hadot argues, quite remarkably, that the goal of
Philosophical Investigations requires a certain literary genre, that one cannot
dissociate the form of the Investigations from Wittgenstein's conception of
philosophy.
It is a therapeutics that is offered to us. Philosophy is an illness of
language ... The true philosophy will therefore consist in curing itself
of philosophy, in making every philosophical problem completely and
definitively disappear ... Wittgenstein continues [from the Tractatus to
the Investigations] . . . to devote himself to the same mission: to bring a
radical ;•nd definitive peace to metaphysical worry. Such a purpose
imposes a certain literary genre: the work cannot be the exposition of a
system, a doctrine, a philosophy in the traditional sense ... [Philos11pl1in1/
hn•rstiRt1l1tmsl wi11hcs to Rel liulc by little on our spirit, like a
18 Introduclion
cure, like a medical treatment. The work therefore does not have a
systematic structure, strictly speaking [pas de plan, a proprement parler].91
At the time Hadot was writing about Wittgenstein, and even today, so many
philosophers ignored the way Philosophical Jnvesligalions is written that it is
astonishing, at first sight, to see an historian of ancient philosophy clearly
understanding the import of this aspect of Wittgenstein's work. But Hadot
has long emphasized that ancient philosophy presented itself as a therapeutics
and that this goal profoundly affected the philosophical writing of antiquity.92
As early as 1960 Hadot wrote that in ancient philosophy "more than theses,
one teaches ways, methods, spiritual exercises," that "dogmas" have only a
secondary aspect.93 No doubt it was precisely Hadot's understanding of the
history of ancient philosophy that made it possible for him to see central, but
still neglected, characteristics of Wittgenstein's work.
In "Jeux de langage et philosophic," Hadot was to employ Wittgenstein's
notion of a language game in an historical perspective that, as he recognized,
went well beyond anything with which Wittgenstein was preoccupied. Hadot
argued that we must "break with the idea that philosophical language
functions in a uniform way" and that ''it is impossible to give a meaning to
the positions of philosophers without situating them in their language
game." 'H Aware of the different philosophical language games of antiquity,
Hadot could well insist that an ancient formula be placed in the concrete
context of its determinate language game, that its meaning could change as a
function of a change in language game.95 Thus Hadot could draw the general
historiographical conclusion that we must "consider as very different language
games those literary genres, so profoundly diverse, represented by the
dialogue, the exhortation or protreptic, the hymn or prayer ... the manual,
the dogmatic treatise, the meditation."96 And we must also distinguish
between the attitudes represented by dialectic, rhetorical argumentation,
logical reasoning, and didactic exposition, since we will often be able to
establish that "the very fact of sitt1ating oneself in one of these traditions
predetermines the very content of the doctrine that is expressed in this
language game." 97 By overcoming the temptation to see philosophical language
as always functioning in the same way, Hadot could take account of the
conceptual and literary specificity of different philosophical attitudes.
Whether reading Plotinus, Marcus Aurelius, or Augustine, Hadot has made
detailed use of his methodological prescriptions, not allowing the surface
pronouncements of the texts to obscure the underlying structure, the literary
genre and modes of thought that confer a determinate meaning on these
pronouncements. Employing all of their resources, Hadot has used these
practices of interpretation to try to reconstruct the fundamental meaning (sens
de base), the meaning "intended" by the author (le sens "t,tm/11 " p11r l't111/e11r),
of these ancient tcxts.'18 More often than not , as is c\•idcnt from the cxnmplci;
Introduction 19
I have given, this meaning will not be apparent. And if Hadot's practices of
interpretation are most often employed with respect to ancient p�ilosophical and
theological writing, his discussion of Wittgenstein makes clear the need,
throughout the history of philosophy, for such practices. To restrict the
importance of Hadot's lessons to one period in the history of thought would be
radically to misunderstand the techniques and procedures of human thought.
2 Spiritual Exercises
Hadot has written that he was led to become aware of the importance of what
he has called "spiritual exercises" by his work of interpretation of ancient
philosophical texts.99 On the one hand, like his predecessors and contemporaries,
Hadot encountered the well-known phenomenon of the incoherences,
even contradictions, in the works of ancient philosophical authors. On the
other hand, many modern historians of ancient philosophy have begun from
the assumption that ancient philosophers were attempting, in the same way
as modern philosophers, to construct systems, that ancient philosophy was
essentially a philosophical discourse consisting of a "certain type of organization
of language, comprised of propositions having as their object the
universe, human society, and language itself." 100 Thus the essential task of the
historian of philosophy was thought to consist in "the analysis of the genesis
and the structures of the literary works that were written by the philosophers,
especially in the study of the rational connection and the internal coherence
of these systematic expositions." 101 Under these interpretive constraints,
modern historians of ancient philosophy could not but deplore the awkward
expositions, defects of composition, and outright incoherences in the ancient
authors they studied.
1112
Hadot, however, rather than deploring these ancient authors' failures to
measure up to the modern standard of the systematic philosophical treatise,
realized that in order to understand and explain these apparent defects, one
must not only analyze the structure of these ancient philosophical texts, but
one must also situate them in the "living praxis from which they emanated." 103
An essential aspect of this living praxis was the oral dimension of ancient
philosophy, and the written philosophical works of Greco-Roman antiquity
were "never completely free of the constraints imposed by oral transmission."
uu Hadot has described this written work as only a material support
for a spoken word intended to become spoken word again, "like a modern
record or cassette which are only an intermediary between two events: the
recording and the rehearing." 105 All of ancient philosophy believed in what
1-ladot once called, thinking of Plato's Phaedrus, the "ontological value of the
spoken word"; 1 his living and animated discourse was not principally intended
to 1 r11 11Nmi1 inform111ion, hu1 "10 tlroducc a certain psychic effect in the reader
20 Introduction
or listener." 106 Thus the "propositional element" was not the most important
element of ancient philosophical teaching, and Hadot has frequently cited
Victor Goldschmitt's formula, originally applied to the Platonic dialogues but
used by Hadot to characterize ancient philosophy more generally, that ancient
philosophical discourse intended "to form more than to inform." 1
07
Hadot claims that it is probably a mistake about the nature of ancient
philosophy to consider abstraction, made possible by writing, its most
important characteristic:
For ancient philosophy, at least beginning from the sophists and
Socrates, intended, in the first instance, to form people and to transform
souls. That is why, in Antiquity, philosophical teaching is given above
all in oral form, because only the living word, in dialogues, in
conversations pursued for a long time, can accomplish such an action.
The written work, considerable as it is, is therefore most of the time
only an echo or a complement of this oral teaching. 108
This is one reason why, for Hadot, to philosophize is to learn how to
dialogue.109 A Socratic dialogue is a spiritual exercise practiced in common,
and it incites one to give attention to oneself, to take care of oneself, to know
oneself. The Socratic maxim "know thyself" requires a relation of the self to
itself that "constitutes the basis of all spiritual exercises." im Every spiritual
exercise is dialogical insofar as it is an "exercise of authentic presence" of the
self to itself, and of the self to others. 111 The Socratic and Platonic dialogues
exhibit this authentic presence in the way that they show that what is most
important is not the solution to a particular problem, but the path traversed
together in arriving at this solution. Hence, we can understand the critical
significance of the dimension of the interlocutor, with all of its starts and
stops, hesitations, detours, and digressions. This essential dimension
prevents the dialogue from being a theoretical and dogmatic account and
forces it to be a concrete and practical exercise, because, to be precise,
it is not concerned with the exposition of a doctrine, but with guiding
an interlocutor to a certain settled mental attitude: it is a combat,
amicable but real. We should note that this is what takes place in every
spiritual exercise; it is necessary to make oneself change one's point of
view, attitude, set of convictions, therefore to dialogue with oneself,
therefore to struggle with oneself.1 IZ
Although Hadot recognizes that some ancient philosophical works are so to
speak "more written" than others, he insists that even these works "are closely
linked to the activity of teaching" and must "be understood from the
perspective of dialectical and exegetical scholarly exercises." 11·1 The tnsk of I he
Introduction 21
philosopher was not primarily one of communicating "an encyclopedic
knowledge in the form of a system of propositions and of concepts that would
reflect, more or less well, the system of the world." 1
14 Therefore, even
definitions were nothing by themselves, independently of the road traveled to
reach them. The philosophers of antiquity were concerned not with readymade
knowledge, but with imparting that training and education that would
allow their disciples to "orient themselves in thought, in the life of the city,
or in the world." 1 15 If this is most obviously true of the Platonic dialogues,
Hadot has reminded us that it is also true of the methods of Aristotle and the
treatises of Plotinus: "the written philosophical work, precisely because it is a
direct or indirect echo of oral teaching, now appears to us as a set of exercises,
intended to make one practice a method, rather than as a doctrinal exposition."
1 16
Moreover, these exercises were not conceived of as purely intellectual , as
merely theoretical and formal exercises of discourse totally separated from life.
Throughout the history of ancient philosophy, we can find criticisms of those
philosophers who went no further than to develop a beautiful style of
discourse or dialectical subtlety, who wished to stand out by making an
ostentatious display of their philosophical discourse, but did not exercise
themselves in the things of life. 1 17 Rather than aiming at the acquisition of a
purely abstract knowledge, these exercises aimed at realizing a transformation
of one's vision of the world and a metamorphosis of one's personality. The
philosopher needed to be trained not only to know how to speak and debate,
but also to know how to live. The exercise of philosophy "was therefore not
only intellectual, but could also be spiritual." 1 18 Hence, the teaching and
training of philosophy were intended not simply to develop the intelligence
of the disciple, but to transform all aspects of his being - intellect,
imagination, sensibility, and will. Its goal was nothing less than an art of
living, and so spiritual exercises were exercises in learning to live the
philosophical life.
1 19 Spiritual exercises were e.wrcises because they were
practical, required effort and training, and were lived; they were spiritual
because they involved the entire spirit, one's whole way of being. 120 The art
of living demanded by philosophy was a lived exercise exhibited in every
aspect of one's existence.
Since the u ltimate goal of the theoretical discourse of philosophy was to
produce an effect in the soul of the listener or reader, this discourse had to
bear in mind not only pedagogical constraints, but "the needs of psychagogy,
of the direction of souls." 121 Rhetorical resources were abundantly made use
of by the philosopher, and in attempting to influence himself and others all
means were good. 122 In order "to rectify distorted opinions, tenacious
prejudices, irrational terrors," the philosopher might have "to twist them in
the other direction, to exaggerate in order to compensate." 123 In ancient texts,
we dii;cover thiu "one slides rapidly from theoretical exposition to
22 Introduction
exhortation," as often happens in Plotinus' treatises;1H we even find at the end
of the Nicomachean Ethics an accentuated protreptic and exhortative character,
as Aristotle is recommending to others a certain kind of life, a spetific
conception of the good life. 125 The "presentation, literary form and content"
of philosophical discourse were modified by "the intention to influence the
disciples." 12
6 It is from this perspective that Hadot believes we must
understand "the effort of systematization of the Stoics and Epicureans." 127 He
has argued that the systematic discourse of these schools did not have for its
chief goal
to procure a total and exhaustive explanation of all reality, but to link,
in an unshakable way, a small group of principles, vigorously articulated
together, which, on the one hand, on the basis of this systematization,
possess a greater persuasive force, a better psychological efficacy and
which, on the other hand, enable the philosopher to orient himself in
the world. 128
This systematization thus allows the philosopher to bring together and focus
the fundamental rules of life so that he can "keep them ready to hand at each
instant of his life." 129 As Hadot says, "their systematic presentation produces
assurance [la certitude] in the soul, therefore peace and serenity. " 1 30
In studying the literary genre of the ancient consolation, llsetraut Hadot
has clearly demonstrated the intimate connection between the practice of
spiritual exercises, the use of rhetoric and psychagogy, and literary form and
content. Since, beginning with Plato, ancient philosophy represented itself as
an exercise and training for death, the consolation is an ideal genre in which
to observe the ancient practice of philosophy. 1 .11 Noting that in all the written
consolations of antiquity, we encounter nearly always the same arguments, she
remarks that new and original arguments were not what the ancients sought
after; in the best instances, the consolations had as their goal "to recall
well-known things, to reactivate them in the soul." 1
.12 These consolations were
one important place where ancient philosophers tried to provide their
followers with the spiritual means to maintain their psychic equilibrium, a
goal that was especially acute and difficult in situations that were precarious
and painful.
In order to obtain this result, they had, on the one hand, to develop and
teach their philosophical doctrines, but, on the other hand, they were
perfectly conscious of the fact that the simple knowledge of a doctrine,
beneficial as it was, did not guarantee its being put into practice. To have
learned theoretically that death is not an evil does not suffice to no longer
fear it. In order for this truth to be able to penetrate to the depths of
one's being, so that it is not believed only for a brief moment, but
Introduction
becomes an unshakable conviction, so that it is always "ready," "at
hand," "present to mind," so that it is a "habitus of the , soul" as the
Ancients said, one must exercise oneself constantly and without respite
- "night and day," as Cicero said. To this is joined a simple mode of
life, in order not to be accustomed to what is superfluous the day it will
be necessary to separate oneself from it.
These exercises are certainly exercises of meditation, but they do not
only concern reason; in order to be efficacious, they must link the
imagination and affectivity to the work of reason, and therefore all the
psychagogical means of rhetoric . . . 1.13
23
Hence we also find recommended, especially by the Stoics, the practice of
premeditation on future evils that may occur, and the need to keep present
and available in one's memory "all the edifying examples that history, epic
poetry and tragedy" entrust to us. •.M
The central place accorded to spiritual exercises in ancient philosophy
determines how we should situate and understand the writings of ancient
philosophers, their philosophical discourse. The significance and aims of this
discourse were conditioned by the ultimate goal of transforming the lives of
individuals, of providing them with a philosophical art of living that required
nothing less than spiritual metamorphosis. We must not forget that in the
philosophy of this period, "theory is never considered an end in itself, it is
clearly and decidedly put in the service of practice," a practice so radical and
all-encompassing as to make the philosopher atopos, unclassifiable, since he is
in love with wisdom, which makes him strange, and foreign to the world of
most mortals. us Hadot pointedly captures the relation between philosophical
writing, the oral tradition, and an art of living when he writes that ancient
philosophy "always endeavored to be more a living voice than writing and still
more a life than a voice.'' l lh The animated words of the philosopher are at the
service of the philosopher's way of life, and his writing is an echo of these
words. We might think here of Socrates, of his constant dialogue with himself
and others. This dialogue is never closed in on itself, separate and isolated,
but is part of, and in service to, Socrates' way of living and way of dying.
According to Xenophon, when Hippias demanded the definition of justice
from Socrates, he finally responded with these words: "Instead of speaking
of it, I make it understood by my acts." 137 If spiritual exercises were the
core of ancient philosophy, that is because philosophy was essentially a way
of life.
In order to understand the centrality of spiritual exercises to ancient
philosophy, it is crucial not to limit or reduce them to ethical exercises. As I
hove said, spiritual exercises involved all aspects of one's existence; they did
not nl lcmpt only lo immrc behavior in 11ccord11ncc with a code of good
24 Introduction
conduct; they had, as Hadot says, not only a moral value, but an existential
value. l l8 More specifically, if we recall the traditional distinction between the
three parts of philosophy - dialectic or logic, physics, and ethics - we must
not place the practice of spiritual exercises simply in the ethical part of
philosophy. 139 We must not represent logic and physics as being those parts
of philosophy where theoretical discourse is located, presenting ethics as the
practical part where spiritual exercises are enacted. As Hadot has argued at
length, the distinction between theory and practice is located within each of
the parts of philosophy; there is a theoretical discourse concerning logic,
physics and ethics, but there is also a practical or lived logic, a lived physics,
and a lived ethics. Ho
Ethics itself contains a theoretical discourse that sets forth principles,
definitions, distinctions, and analyses of the virtues and vices. But, more
importantly for the philosopher, there is also a lived ethics that puts into
practice the fundamental rules of life. 141 Similarly, there is a theory of logic,
which includes a conception of the proposition, and explains different forms
of syllogisms, and different ways of refuting sophisms; in addition, the theory
of logic was comprised of scholarly exercises in which one learned to apply
the abstract rules. These rules of logic were also employed in the theoretical
discourses of physics and ethics, the two other parts of philosophy. Yet, again,
there was also an everyday practice of logic that had to be carried out in the
domain of judgment and assent. This lived logic consisted in "not giving one's
consent to what is false or doubtful." 14
2 Finally, the discipline of physics
included not only a theory, but a lived physics, a true spiritual exercise, which
involved a way of seeing the world, a cosmic consciousness, and procured
pleasure and joy for the soul. Ml The spiritual exercises of ethics, logic, and
physics meant that the practice of philosophy did not ultimately consist in
"producing the theory of logic, that is the theory of speaking well and
thinking well, nor in producing the theory of physics, that is of the cosmos,
nor in producing the theory of acting well, but it concerned actually speaking
well, thinking well, acting well, being truly conscious of one's place in the
cosmos." 141
The significance of locating spiritual exercises within each of the parts of
philosophy can be seen clearly in Hadot's criticisms of Michel Foucault. One
way of describing Hadot's misgivings about Foucault's interpretation of
ancient spiritual exercises is to say that Foucault not only gave a too narrow
construal of ancient ethics, but that he limited the "care of the self" to ethics
alone. 145 Foucault made no place for that cosmic consciousness, for physics as
a spiritual exercise, that was so important to the way in which the ancient
philosopher viewed his relation to the world. By not attending to that aspect
of the care of the self that places the self within a cosmic dimension, whereby
the self, in becoming aware of its belonging to the cosmic Whole, thus
transforms itself, Foucault was not able to sec the full scope of spirir unl
Introduction 25
exercises, that physics (and logic), as much as ethics, aimed at selftransformation.
Indeed, in a very different context, Paul Vey,ne has reported
the following exchange with Foucault: "One day when I asked Foucault: 'The ·
care of the self, that is very nice, but what do you do with logic, what do you
do with physics?', he responded: 'Oh, these are enormous excrescences!' " 146
Nothing could be further from Hadot's own attitude, since for him logic and
physics, as lived spiritual exercises, are as central to the nature of philosophy
as is ethics. Far from being excrescences, disfiguring and superfluous, the
practices of logic and physics were a necessary part of the ancient philosopher's
way of life, were crucial to his experience of himself as a philosopher,
a lover of wisdom.
In recent writings, Hadot has focused on the Stoic doctrine that logic,
physics, and ethics are not parts of philosophy itself, but are parts of
philosophical discourse (logos kata philosophian), of the discourse relating
to philosophy. 147 The Stoics held that "these parts could only appear distinct
and separate in the discourse of teaching and of exposition of the philosophical
dogmas," and that philosophy, strictly speaking, was not divided into
parts. 148 Although expository, didactic, and pedagogical requirements made it
necessary "to cut up" philosophy into parts, philosophy proper, as an exercise
of wisdom, was considered a "single act, renewed at every instant, that one
can describe, without breaking its unity, as being the exercise of logic as well
as of physics or of ethics, according to the directions in which it is
exercised." 149 That is to say, in the lived singular act of philosophy, logic,
physics, and ethics are but "aspects of the very same virtue and very same
\l;sdom"; they are not really distinguished with respect to one another, but
only by "the different relations that relate them to different objects, the world,
people, thought itself." 150 As Hadot summarizes this view, "logic, physics and
ethics distinguish themselvt..'S from one another when one speaks of philosophy,
but not when one lives it." 1
5
1
For the Stoics the dynamic unity of reality, the coherence of reason with
itself, meant that
It is the same Logos that produces the world, enlightens the human
being in his faculty of reasoning and expresses itself in human discourse,
while remaining completely identical with itself at all stages of reality.
Therefore, physics has for its object the Logos of universal nature,
ethics the Logos of reasonable human nature, logic this same Logos
expressing itself in human discourse. From start to finish, it is therefore
the same force and the same reality that is at the same time creative
Nature, Norm of conduct and Rule of discourse. 152
This func.lnmental intuit ion of the Stoics, according to which the Logos is the
common object of logic, llhysics, and ethics, is continued by those early
26 Introduction
Christian thinkers who present God as the common object of the three parts
of philosophy.m So, according to Augustine, the object of physics is God as
cause of being, the object of logic is God as norm of thought and the object
of ethics is God as rule of life. Moreover, this order - physics, logic, ethics -
corresponds to the order of the divine persons in the Trinity: the Father is
the Principle of being, the Son is Intellect and the Holy Spirit is Love. Thus,
as Hadot writes, "the systematic unity of the parts of philosophy reflects here
the reciprocal intcriority of the divine Persons." 154
When the Stoic philosopher, such as Epictetus or Marcus Aurelius,
acts according to the Logos, he puts into practice spiritual exercises, that
is, he disciplines his judgments, his desire, his inclinations, he enacts a lived
logic, a lived physics, a lived ethics. These three acts of the soul exhibit
the coherence and harmony of reason with itself, and from this perspective
"the three parts of philosophy are no longer anything but three aspects of the
fundamental spiritual attitude of the Stoic. " 155 Although emphasizing that
the parts of philosophy arc required by and located within philosophical
discourse and that philosophy itself is the site of spiritual exercises,
Hadot also insists on the central role that discourse plays in the philosophical
life. The philosopher can "only act on himself and others through
discourse," and philosophy is thus "a mode of life that includes as an
integral part a certain mode of discourse." 156 The theoreti<.-al discourse of the
school to which he belongs is inwardly repeated and assimilated by the
philosopher so that he can master his own inner discourse, so that his
discourse will be ordered according to the fundamental choices and principles
that were the starting point and basis for the theoretical discourse of his
school. 157
Recently, Hadot has distinguished between two senses of the word "discourse"
in ancient philosophy.
On the one hand, discourse insofar as it is addressed to a disciple or to
oneself, that is to say, the discourse linked to an existential context, to
a concrete praxis, discourse that is actually spiritual exercise; on the
other hand, discourse considered abstractly in its formal structure, in its
intelligible content. It is the latter that the Stoics would consider
different from philosophy, but which is precisely what is usually made
the object of most of the modern studies of the h istory of philosophy.
But in the eyes of the ancient philosophers, if one contents oneself with
this discourse, one docs not do philosophy. 1
58
Although discourse, both inner and outer, is essential to the philosopher, and
although it can even take on the dimensions of a spiritual exercise, it is not
the unique component of the philosophical life, and this life must not be
reduced to discourse.
Introduction
The essential element [of philosophical life] is in fact, one could say,
non-discursive, insofar as it represents a choice of life, a wi'h to live in
such and such a way, with all the concrete consequences that that
implies in everyday life.159
In Antiquity the philosopher regards himself as a philosopher, not
because he develops a philosophical discourse, but because he lives
philosophically .160
27
We find this essential clement, this orientation and point of view, in the
remark of Epicurus' that "Our only occupation should be the cure of
ourselves," or in the sentence attributed to him, "Empty is the discourse of
that philosopher by which no human passion is attended to." 1 61 Or we find
Epictetus saying,
A carpenter does not come up to you and say "Listen to me discourse
about the art of carpentry," but he makes a contract for a house and
builds it . . . Do the same thing yourself. Eat like a man, drink like a
man . .. get married, have children, take part in civic life, learn how to
put up with insults, and tolerate other people . .. 162
Epictetus elsewhere rebukes the person who, in the discipline of j udgment, is
presented with representations some of which are adequate and others not,
yet who refuses to differentiate between them, but "would prefer to read
theoretical treatises on the understanding." 163 And in commenting on Epictetus'
Manut1l, Simplicius writes,
One must produce the actions that arc taught by discourses. The goal
of discourse is actually actions. It is for the sake of them that the
discourses were uttered (or written) ... In fact, Chrysippus did not
write on this subject [the nature of man] with the goal of being
interpreted and understood, but so that one makes use of his writings
in life. If therefore I make use of his writings in life, at that very moment
I participate in the good they contain. But if I admire the:: exegete
because he provides good explanations, and if I can understand and
myself interpret the text and if, quite frankly, everything falls to my lot
except the fact of making use of these writings in life, would I have
become anything other than a grammarian instead of a philosopher? . . .
the fact of just simply reading the writings of Chrysippus or of
explaining them on the request of somebody else, and of not making use
of them in life, is reprehensible. In fact, he should rightly be ashamed
who, being ill, would find some writings containing cures for his illness,
would rc:1ul 1 hcm with insiicht and, distinguishing clearly (the different
28 Introduction
parts), would explain them if need be to others, but would not make use
of these cures for his illness.164
Philosophy is an art of living that cures us of our illnesses by teaching us a
radically new way of life.
Hadot recognizes that it is only in Hellenistic philosophy that one finds a
distinction between philosophy and philosophical discourse explicitly formulated.
But he has also argued that "this distinction was clearly implicit in
the previous period in Plato and Aristotle." 165 Indeed, recalling the importance
of the mysteries of Eleusis in the history of ancient thought, Hadot
reminds us of the famous sentence attributed to Aristotle that the initiates of
Eleusis do not learn anything, but they experience a certain impression or
emotion.166 The initiate did not learn his other-worldly fate at Eleusis, but
lived this supra-individual life of the other world. 167 The "true secret
of Eleusis is therefore this very e:rperience, this moment when one plunges
into the completely other, this discovery of an unknown dimension of
existence." 1
68
Hadot also finds an implicit distinction between philosophy and philosophical
discourse in Plato's definition of philosophy (Phaedo, 67 <..--d) as a
tr.iining for death. The purification of the soul, its separation as far as possible
from the body and its gathering itself together within itself, is the true
practice of philosophy. Hence philosophy consists of a lived concrete exercise
and not of a theory or a conceptual edifice: "The theoretical philosophical
discourse is completely different from the lived exercises by which the soul
purifies itself of its passions and spiritually separates itself from the body." 169
Plotinus continues this tradition when in Ennead, IV, 7, 10, he argues that the
soul cannot become aware of its own immateriality if it docs not perform a
moral purification that liberates it from its passions, that strips away
everything that is not truly itsclf. '711 It is this purification that allows us to gain
knowledge of the immateriality of our soul. More generally, in Ennead, VI, 7,
36, Plotinus distinguishes carefully between the methods of rational
theology that teach us about the Good, and the spiritual exercises that lead
us to the Good. The four methods of rational theology, the method of
analogy, the negative method, the affirmative method drawn from the
knowledge of the things that come from the Good, and the method of stages
or degrees (anabasmoi; Symposium, 21 lc) all give us knowledge about the Good.
However, only the spiritual exercises of purification, of the practice of the
virtues, of putting ourselves in order, allow us to touch the Good, to experience
it. 1
71 Plotinus' philosophy does not wish only
to be a discourse about objects, be they even the highest, but it wishes
actually to lead the soul to a living, concrete union with the Intellect and
the Good . . . Reason, by theolop;ical methods, can raise i tself tu t he
Introduction
notion of the Good but only life according to Intellect can lead to the
reality of the Good.112
29
Furthermore, as Hadot writes, "it is mystical experience that founds negative
theology, and not the reverse." 173 This mystical experience, like the mysteries
of Eleusis, does not consist in learning something, but in "living another life"
where the self "becomes the absolutely Other." 174
It is perhaps Aristotle whom we are most tempted to think of as a pure
theoretician. Although it is true that Aristotle's philosophy is a philosophy of
theoria, "this Aristotelian theoria is nevertheless not purely theoretical in the
modern sense of the word." 175 For Aristotle, to dedicate oneself to philosophy
is to chose a bios, a way of life, that is the best realization of those capacities
that are essential to being human. The bios theoretikos, the life of contemplation,
is a way of life that is also the realization of our supreme happiness, an
activity that contains the purest pleasures.176 Even scientific research on the
entities of nature is not proposed by Aristotle as an end in itself, but as "a
particular way of carrying out 'the philosophical life', one of the possible
practical realizations of the aristotelian prescription for happiness, the life
devoted to the activity of the intellect." 177 Moreover, the life of the intellect
is a participation in the divine way of life, it is the actualization of the divine
in the human, and it requires inner transformation and personal askesis. 118 And
it is a way of life that is, in one sense of the term, practical, since Aristotle
says that those thoughts arc practical not only that calculate the results of
action, but which are "contemplation and reasoning, that have their end in
themselves and take themselves as object." 179 This life of theoria is thus not
opposed to the practical, since it is a life of philosophy lived and practiced; it
is precisely the "exercise of a life." 180
Hadot has distinguished two senses of the tenn "theoretical,'' for which he
has employed the tcnns theorique and theoretique. The first meaning of "theoretical"
is opposed to "practical," since it designates theoretical discourse as
opposed to lived philosophy. But the adjective theorhique which characterizes
the life of contemplation, the life according to the intellect, is not opposed by
Aristotle to philosophy as practiced and lived. In Aristotle this "theoretical life
[vie theoretique] is not a pure abstraction, but a life of the intellect, which, no
doubt, can use a theoretical discourse [discours theorique], but nonetheless
remains a life and a praxis, and which can even make room for a nondiscursivc
activity of thought, when it is a question of perceiving indivisible obj<.. 'Cts and
God himself by noetic intuition."181 Thus to think of Aristotle as a pure
theoretician is to focus exclusively on his theoretical discourse without hearing
in mind that it is a way of life, however intellectualized, that he is recommending,
and which is the ultimate basis of his philosophy.
The idc11 of philosophy as 11 way of life, and not just as philosophical
lliscourHe, WilH also exhihiled in nntiquity by the designation of individuals as
30 Introduction
philosophers who were neither scholars, professors, nor authors, but who
were honored as philosophers because of their way of life. As Hadot says, the
extension of the concept of philosopher was quite different from that of our
modern concept. In antiquity, the philosopher was not necessarily "a professor
or a writer. He was first of all a person having a certain style of life, which
he willingly chose, even if he had neither taught nor written." 1
82 Thus we
find philosophical figures not only such as Diogenes the Cynic and Pyrrho,
but also women who did not write, and celebrated statesmen who were
considered true philosophers by their contemporaries. 18l It was not only
Chrysippus or Epicurus who were considered philosophers, because they had
developed a philosophical discourse, but also every person who lived according
to the precepts of Chrysippus or Epicurus. 131
True philosophers lived in society with their fellow citizens, and yet they
lived in a diff erent way from other people. They distinguished themselves from
others by "their moral conduct, by speaking their mind [leur franc par/er], by
their way of nourishing themselves or dressing themselves, by their attitude
with respect to wealth and to conventional values." 185 Although they did not
live a cloistered life, as in Christian monasticism, philosophy was nevertheless
analogous to the monastic movement in requiring that one convert oneself so
as to fervently adhere to a philosophical school: the philosopher had to "make
a choice that obliged him to transform his whole way of living in the world." "'"
Hence the felt rupture of the philosophical life with the conduct and
perceptions of everyday life.187 The significance of philosophy as a way of life
can also be seen in the importance given to biographies in ancient philosophical
work. As Giuseppe Cambiano has emphasized, a philosophical biography was
not predominantly a narrative intended to allow one to understand an author
and his doctrines; it was not just a report of what the author said and believed.
Rather, "it was, in the first place, a tool of philosophical battle," since one
could defend or condemn a philosophy by way of the characteristics of the
mode of life of those who supported it.11'8
The philosopher was a philosopher because of his existential atlitude, an
attitude that was the foundation of his philosophy and that required that he
undergo a real conversion, in the strongest sense of the word, that he radically
change the direction of his lifc.189 All six schools of philosophy in the
Hellenistic period present themselves
as choices of life, they demand an existential choice, and whoever
adheres to one of these schools must accept this choice and this option.
One too often represents Stoicism or Epicureanism as a set of abstract
theories about the world invented by Zeno or Chrysippus or Epicurus.
From these theories would spring, as if by accident one could say, a
morality. But it is the reverse that is true. It is the abstract theories th111
arc intended to justify the existential nttitudc. One could 1my, tu cxpn·N11
Introduction
it otherwise, that every existential attitude implies a representation of
the world that must necessarily be expressed in a discour,e. But this
discourse alone is not the philosophy, it is only an element of it, for the
philosophy is first of all the existential attitude itself, accompanied by
inner and outer discourses: the latter have as their role to express the
representation of the world that is implied in such and such an
existential attitude, and these discourses allow one at the same time to
rationally justify the attitude and to communicate it to others.190
31
Hence we begin with a fundamental existential choice on behalf of a style of
life that consists of certain practices, activities, and conduct that are precisely
what Hadot calls "spiritual exercises." This style of life is given concrete form
either in the order of inner discourse and of spiritual activity: meditation,
dialogue with oneself, examination of conscience, exercises of the
imagination, such as the view from above on the cosmos or the earth,
or in the order of action and of daily behavior, like the mastery
of oneself, indifference towards ill.different things, the fulfilment of
the duties of social life in Stoicism, the discipline of desires in
Epicurcanism.191
Philosophical discourse, of oneself with oneself and of oneself with others,
will, of course, be needed to justify and communicate these spiritual exercises,
to represent the fundamental existential attitude, but philosophy itself consists
primarily in choosing and living the attitude.
Hadot recognizes that this ancient understanding of philosophy can appear
very far removed from the way in which we now understand the nature of
philosophy. He has pointed to three aspects of the evolution of the representation
of philosophy that have contributed to our current understanding of
it as a purely theoretical, abstract activity, and to our identific.ation of it with
philosophical discourse alone. The first aspect, which Hadot has called "a
natural inclination of the philosophical mind" and "connatural to the
philosopher," is the "constant tendency that the philosopher always has, even
in Antiquity, to satisfy himself with discourse, with the conceptual architecture
that he has constructed, without putting into question his own life." 192
This tendency, which was already criticized in antiquity, has been said by
Hadot to be "the perpetual danger of philosophy" - the philosopher is always
tempted to take refuge in, to shut himself up in, the "reassuring universe of
concepts and of discourse instead of going beyond discourse in order to take
upon himself the risk of the radical transformation of himself." 193 To this
tendency is opposed the equally natural inclination of the philosophical mind
to Wllnl lo examine itself, tu w11111 to learn how to live the philosophical life.
32 Introduction
Faced with the overwhelming reality of life, with worries, anxiety, suffering,
death, philosophical discourse can appear to be nothing but "empty chattering
and a derisive luxury," mere words when what is needed is a new attitude
towards life, one which will produce inner freedom, tranquillity, happiness. 194
It is at these moments that our contrary natural inclinations will be felt to be
most acutely opposed to one another. We will then be forced to ask, "What
is finally most beneficial to the human being as a human being? Is it to
discourse on language, or on being and non-being? Or is it not rather to learn
how to live a human life?" 195 Yet despite our "elementary need" for this
philosophical consciousness and way of life, the history of philosophy also
testifies unambiguously to the powerful tendency of our "self-satisfaction with
theoretical discourse." 19

A second aspect that helps to account for the changed understanding and
representation of philosophy in the modern world has to do with the historical
evolution of philosophy, especially with the relation between philosophy and
Christianity. Although in early Christianity, especially the monastic movements,
Christianity itself was presented as a philosophia, a way of life in
conformity with the divine Logos, as the Middle Ages developed, one
witnessed a "total separation" of ancient spiritual exercises, which were no
longer considered a part of philosophy but were integrated into Christian
spirituality, and philosophy itself, which became a "simple theoretical tool" at
the service of theology, an ancilla tl1eo/ogiae.191 Philosophy's role was now to
provide theology with the "conceptual, logical, physical and metaphysical
materials it needed," and the "Faculty of Arts became no more than a
preparation for the Faculty of Theology." 198 Philosophical speculation thus
became a purely abstract and theoretical activity, which was set strictly
apart from theological thought and religious practice and spirituality. l'l'J
No longer a way of life, philosophy became a conceptual construction,
a servant of theology, and the idea of philosophy as a system began to
appear.200
A third aspect underlying our modem representation of philosophy is of a
sociological nature, and can be traced back to the functioning of the
university, as it was created by the medieval church. One central feature of
the university is that it is an institution made up of professors who train other
professors, of specialists who learn how to train other specialists. Unlike in
antiquity, when philosophical teaching was directed towards the human being
so as to form him as a human being, the modern university forms professionals
who teach future professionals, and thus philosophy, rather than proposing
an art of living, is presented above all as a "technical language reserved for
specialists." 201 As Hadot says, in "modern university philosophy, philosophy
is obviously no longer a way of life, a kind of life, unless it is the kind of life
of the professor of philosophy." 2112 This sociological requirement of profossionalism,
this situation of scholasticism, fncilitnl'cs nnd rcinforccN the wnd·
Introduction 33
ency to take refuge in the "comfortable universe of concepts and of
discourses"; 203 it gives this natural tendency a social basis J and impetus,
encouraging the display of a specialized technical language, as if philosophical
depth were exhausted by one's ability to make use of conceptual abstractions
and by one's skill at demonstrating the truth and falsity of various propositions.

Thus Hadot has provided three reasons, which one could think of as,
respectively, philosophical, historical, and sociological, that help to account
for the representation of philosophy as a purely theoretical activity, and for
the reduction of philosophy to philosophical discourse. But he has not
overlooked the fact that one can find elements of the ancient representation
of philosophy throughout the history of philosophy, that certain of the
"existential aspects of ancient philosophy" have been constantly rediscovered.:!GI
Among the philosophers he has named as exhibiting this ancient
representation are Abelard and the Renaissance humanists, such as Petrarch
and Erasmus. We might think here of the latter's remark with respect to his
Enchiridion Mi/itis Christiani: "Let this book lead to a theological life rather
than theological disputation." 205 Hadot has repeatedly pointed to Montaigne's
Essays, especially "That to Philosophise is to Learn How to Die," as
embodying the ancient exercise of philosophy, referring to the Essays as "the
breviary of ancient philosophy, the manual of the art of living." ™ Among
modern philosophers, Hadot has singled out certain aspects of Descartes'
Meditations, particularly D<.. -scartes' advice that one invest some months or at
least weeks meditating on his first and second Meditations, which Hadot says
ultimately shows that for Descartes "evidence can only be perceived thanks
to a spiritual exercise." 207 Hadot also mentions Spinoza's Ethics, and its
emphasis on teaching us how to radically transform ourselves, to accede to
beatitude, to approach the ideal of the sage, as well as Shaftesbury's
remarkable Exercises, inspired by the spiritual exercises of Epictetus and
Marcus Aurelius. 268 He has indicated, too, the continuation of the ancient idea
of philosophy in the French philosophes of the eighteenth century, and in
Kant's ideas of the interest of reason and the primacy of the practical. 209 In
more recent times, we can find the spirit of the ancient philosopher's demand
that we radically change our way of living and of seeing the world in Goethe,
Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and Kierkegaard, and, in different ways, in the
young Hegelians and Marx.210 In the twentieth century, Hadot points to
Bergson, to Wittgenstein, to Foucault, and to certain aspects of phenomenology
and existentialism as embodying the ancient attitude, practices, and sense
of what philosophy means.21 1 And recently, Hadot has taken up Thoreau's
Walden, finding in his decision to live in the woods Thoreau's undertaking of
a philosophical act. 2
1
2 This constant reoccurrence of the ancient experience of
phih111ophy, side by side with the tendency to understand philosophy as a
cnnccptunl Hlrucr urc, :in 11hHl rnc1 discourse, shows how complex and even
34 Introduction
contradictory philosophy's own self-understanding has been. Hadot's work
calls for a detailed historical account of philosophy's representations of
itself, of the various ways in which philosophy imagines itself and
exercises its ideals, and of the factors that contribute to its changing evaluations
of itself, to how it views and reviews its own purposes and ultimate
goals.
The permanence of the existential aspects of ancient philosophy has been
highlighted by Hadot in his most recent discussions of what he has called "the
fundamental and universal attitudes of the human being when he searches for
wisdom." 213 From this point of view, Hadot has discerned a universal
Stoicism, Epicureanism, Platonism, Aristotelianism, Cynicism, and Pyrrhonism,
each of which corresponds to a permanent possibility of the human spirit,
and which arc independent of the particular "philosophical or mythical
discourses that have claimed or claim to justify them definitively." m Hadot,
obviously enough, does not believe that we can adopt any of these attitudes
wholly and unmodified, as if we could totally convert to the dogmas and
practices of these schools of ancient philosophy.215 But he does believe that
detached from their outmoded elements and reduced to their essence, to the
extent that "we try to give a meaning to our life, they call upon us to discover
the transformation that could be brought about in our life, if we realized (in
the strongest sense of the term) certain values" that constitute the spirit of
each of these attitudes.21r.
With respect to Stoicism, Hadot has described four features that constitute
the universal Stoic attitude. They arc, first, the Stoic consciousness of "the fact
that no being is alone, but that we make up part of a Whole, constituted by
the totality of human beings as well as by the totality of the cosmos"; second,
the Stoic "feels absolutely serene, free, and invulnerable to the extent that he
has become aware that there is no other evil but moral evil and that the only
thing that counts is the purity of moral consciousness"; third, the Stoic
"believes in the absolute value of the human person," a belief that is "at the
origin of the modern notion of the 'rights of man' "; finally, the Stoic
exercises his concentration "on the present instant, which consists, on the one
hand, in living as if we were seeing the world for the first and for the last
time, and, on the other hand, in being conscious that, in this lived presence
of the instant, we have access to the totality of time and of the world." 2
17
Thus, for Hadot, cosmic consciousness, the purity of moral consciousness, the
recognition of the equality and absolute value of human beings, and the
concentration on the present instant represent the universal Stoic attitude.
The universal Epicurean attitude essentially consists, by way of "a certain
discipline and reduction of desires, in returning from pleasures mixed with
pain and suffering to the simple and pure pleasure of existing. " 2
18 Platonism,
Aristotelianism, Cynicism, and Pyrrhonism also each have 11 univcr11nl chnrncter,
and one of the historical and philosophical t11Hks cnl lcd for1 h h�· I IMl111 'N
Introduction 35
work is precisely to provide a description of each of ttiese universal existential
attitudes, each of the styles of life that they propose. /
Moreover, Hadot has insisted that we do not have to choose between these
different universal attitudes, opting for one to the exclusion of all of the
others. The plurality of ancient schools allows us to compare the consequences
of the different possible fundamental attitudes of reason, thus
offering us "a privileged field of experimentation. " 219 And we should not be
surprised to find, for example, that there are certain people who are half Stoic
and half Epicurean, who accept and combine "Epicurean sensualism" and
"Stoic communion with nature," who practice both Stoic spiritual exercises
of vigilance and Epicurean spiritual exercises aimed at the true pleasure of
existing.220 That is precisely how Hadot characterizes Goethe, Rousseau, and
Thoreau.221 Indeed, Hadot has said that Stoicism and Epicureanism seem to
correspond to "two opposite but inseparable poles of our inner life: tension
and relaxation, duty and serenity, moral consciousness and the joy of
existing." 22
2 To these poles of our inner life, we must add the experiences of
Platonic love and the ascent of the soul as well as of Plotinian unity,
Aristotelian contemplation, Cynic criticism of conventional values and the
effort to endure every test and ordeal we face, Pyrrhonic suspension of
judgment and absolute indifference.223 It is these experiences and ideals, more
than any concepts, that arc the legacy of ancient philosophy to Western
civilization.224 The study of ancient philosophy has taught Hadot that "human
reality is so complex that one can only live it by using simultaneously or
successively the most different methods: tension and relaxation, engagement
and detachment, enthusiasm and reserve, certainty and criticism, passion and
indifference." 225 Lessons in how to live human reality, with all that that
implies - those are the enduring lessons of ancient philosophy.
In his preface to the monumental Dictionnaire des p/1ilosophes antif/ues, Hadot
surveys all of the insufficiently exploited resources that arc available to the
historian of ancient philosophy. He shows how the lists of titles of philosophical
works as well as iconography, papyruses, and inscriptions can all be used
to characterize more fully and accurately the phenomena of philosophy. But
even this vast historical undertaking would not fulfill Hadot's own ultimate
aims:
for the historian of philosophy the task will not be finished for all that:
or more exactly, it should cede place to the philosopher, to the
philosopher who should always remain alive in the historian of philosophy.
This final task will consist in asking oneself, with an increased
lucidity, the decisive question: "What is it to philosophize?"226
Pierre Hndot's own work itself prnvokes us to rcask the question of what it
me11ns to phi lnKophiil', 11nll he provides 11 response as relevant, profound, and
36 Introduction
unsettling today as it was centuries ago. In the last analysis, that is what makes
Pierre Hadot not just a consummate historian of philosophy, but also a
philosopher for our own times.

Forms of Life and Forms of Discourse
in Ancient Philosophy
Mr Administrator,
Dear colleagues,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
"Each one of you expects two things from me on the occasion of this
inaugural lecture: first of all, that I express my thanks to those who made my
presence here possible and second, that I present the method that I will use
to carry out the task entrusted to me." 1 Petrus Ramus, who held the chair in
rhetoric and philosophy at the College Royal, opened his inaugural lecture,
delivered in Latin, with words to this effect on August 24, 1 551, only twenty
years after the founding of this institution. We sec that the practice of giving
this lecture dates back more than four hundred years and that even at that
time its major themes were already set. And I in turn will remain faithful to
this venerable tradition today.
More than a year has gone by already, dear colleagues, since you decided
to create a chair in the History of Hellenistic and Roman Thought. Shortly
thereafter you honored me by entrusting it to me. How, without being
awkward or superficial, can I express the extent of my gratitude and my joy
at the confidence you have shown toward me?
I am able to see in your decision a reflection of that freedom and
independence of mind that have traditionally characterized the great institution
into which you have welcomed me. For, despite my election, I possess
few of the qualities that would usually attract notice, and the discipline I
represent is not among those in fashion today. In a way I am what the Romans
called a lwmo t1ouus, as I do not belong to that intellectual nobility one of
whose principal titles is traditionally that of "former student of the Ecole
Normalc Supcricure." Moreover, you certainly noticed during my visits to
you that l hick that tmnquil authority conferred by the use and mastery of
50 Method
the idioms currently spoken in the Republic of Letters. My language, as you will
again ascertain today, is not graced with those mannerisms that now seem to be
required when one ventures to speak of the human sciences. However, several of
you encouraged me to present my candidacy, and during the traditional visits,
which so enriched me, I was extremely touched to find so much sympathy and
interest, particularly among those of you who are specialists in the exact sciences,
for the field of research I have come before you to defend. In other words, I
believe I did not have to convince you - you were persuaded already - of the
need for the College to ensure a way to maintain the close bonds between areas
of teaching and research that are too often artificially separated: Latin and Greek,
philology and philosophy, Hellenism and Christianity. I thus marveled to
discover that at the end of the twentieth century, when many of you on a daily
basis employ technical procedures, modes of reasoning, and representations of the
universe of almost superhuman complexity that open a future to humanity w,e
could not even conceive of earlier, the ideal of humanism, which inspired the
foundation of the College de France, continues to retain for you, undoubtedly in
a more conscious and critical but also more vast, intense, and profound form, all
of its value and significance.
I spoke of a close connection between Greek and Latin, philology and
philosophy, Hellenism and Christianity. I believe that this formulation
corresponds exactly to the inspiration found in the teaching of Pierre
Courcelle, who was my colleague at the Fifth Section of the Ecole Pratique
des Hautes Etudes and to whom I wish to render homage today, indeed,
whom I succeed, if I may say so, in an indirect line, via the appointment of
Rolf Stein. I believe that Pierre Courcelle, who was so brutally taken from us,
is intensely present in the hearts of many of us tonight. For me he was a
teacher who taught me much, but he was also a friend who showed great
concern for me. I will speak now only of the scholar, to recall his immense
output of truly great books, innumc:rable articles, and hundreds of reviews. I
do not know if the scope of this gigantic labor has been sufficiently measured.
The first lines of his great work Lettres grecques en Occident de Macrobe ti
Ctissiodore give a clear idea of the revolutionary direction his work had for his
time. "A substantial book on Hellenistic literature in the West from the death
of Theodosius up to the time of the Justinian reconquest may seem
surprising," wrote Courcelle. First of all, it was surprising for a Latinist to be
interested in Greek literature. However, as Courcelle noted, this Greek
literature made possible the flowering of Latin literature and produced
Cicero, who represented the most complete development of Greco-Roman
culture at its apex, and it was this literature that nearly became a substitute
for Latin when during the second century AD Latin was overshadowed by
Greek as a literary language. However, it still must be stated and dl·plorcd
that, despite Courcelle's initiative and example and owing to 11 prd111
lii't• 1 h11 1
Forms of Life and Forms of Discourse 51
has not been totally overcome and that maintains the disastrous break made
in French scholarship between Greek and Latin, what he had to say in 1 943,
forty years ago, is unfortunately still true today: "I know of no synthetic work
that examines the Greek influence on the thought and culture of the Roman
Empire." Once again it was surprising to see a Latinist devote such an
important study to a later period and show that in the fifth and sixth
centuries, a time of so-called decadence, Greek literature had undergone a
remarkable renaissance, which, thanks to Augustine, Macrobius, Boethius,
Martianus Capella, and Cassiodorus, was to make it possible for the European
Middle Ages to maintain contact with Greek thought until the Arab
translations made possible its rediscovery in richer sources. Again, it was
surprising to see a philologist attack problems in the history of philosophy,
showing the key influence exercised on Latin Christian thought by Greek and
p11gan Neoplatonism, not only by Plotinus but - this was an important detail
- by his disciple Porphyry as well. Even more surprising, this philologist
based his conclusions on a rigorously philological method. I mean that he was
not content merely to reveal vague analogies between Neoplatonic and
Christian doctrines or to evaluate influences and originalities in a purely
subjective way - in a word, to rely on rhetoric and inspiration to establish his
conclusions. No, following the example of Paul Henry, the learned editor of
Plotinus who has also been a model of scientific method for me, Courcelle
compared the texts. He discovered what anyone could have seen but no one
had seen before him, that a certain text of Ambrose had been literally
translated from Plotinus, that one of Boethius had been literally translated
from a Greek Neoplatonic commentator on Aristotle. This method made it
possible to establish indisputable facts, to bring the history of thought out of
the vagueness and artistic indistinctness into which certain historians, even
contemporaries of Courcelle, tended to relegate it.
If Les Lettres grecques en Occident provoked surprise, the Recherches sur /es
"Confessions " de saint Augustin, the first edition of which appeared in 1 950,
almost caused a scandal, particularly because of the interpretation Courcelle
proposed for Augustine's account of his own conversion. Augustine recounts
that as he was weeping beneath a fig tree, overcome with pressing questions
and heaping bitter reproaches upon himself for his indecision, he heard a
child's voice repeating, "Take it ip and read." He then opened Paul's Epistles
at random, as if he were drawing a lot, and read the passage that converted
him. Alerted by his profound knowledge of Augustine's literary procedures
and the traditions of Christian allegory, Courcelle dared to write that the fig
tree could well have a purely symbolic value, representing the "mortal shadow
of sin," and that the child's voice could also have been introduced in a purely
l iterary way to indicate allegorically the divine response to Augustine's
quest ioning. Courcelle did not suspect the uproar his interpretation would
unkn11h. II l11i;1ed nlmmil l wcnty ye1m;, The greatest names in international
52 Method
patristics entered the fray. Obviously I do not wish to rekindle the flames
here. But I would like to stress how interesting his position was from a
methodological point of view. Indeed it began with the very simple principle
that a text should be interpreted in light of the literary genre to which it
belongs. Most of Courcelle's opponents were victims of the modern, anachronistic
prejudice that consists in believing that Augustine's Confessions is
primarily an autobiographical account. Courcelle on the contrary had understood
that the Confessions is essentially a theological work, in which each scene
may take on a symbolic meaning. One is always surprised, for example, by
the length of Augustine's account of his stealing pears while he was an
adolescent. But this is explained by the fact that these fruits stolen from a
garden become symbolically, for Augustine, the forbidden fruit stolen from
the Garden of Eden, and the episode gives him the opportunity to develop a
theological reflection on the nature of sin. In this literary genre, then, it is
extremely difficult to distinguish between a symbolic enactment and an
account of a historical event.
A very large part of Courcellc's work was devoted to tracing the fortunes
of great themes such as "Know thyself" or great works such as Augustine's
Confessions or Boethius' Ctm$o/ation of Phi/O$t>Pkl' in the history of Western
thought. Not the least original of his contributions, appearing in several of
the major works he wrote from this perspective, was his association of literary
study and iconographical inquiry, pertaining, for example, to illustrations
produced throughout the ages for the Confessions or the Consolation. These
iconographical studies, which are fundamental in reconstructing the history
of religious mentalities and imagination, were all undertaken in collaboration
with Mrs Jeanne Courcelle, whose great knowledge of the techniques of art
history and iconographic description greatly enriched her husband's work.
This all-too-brief recollection permits a glimpse, I hope, of the general
development, the itinerary, of Courcelle's research. Starting from late antiquity,
he was led to go back in time, especially in his book on , the theme of
"Know thyself," toward the philosoP.hY of the imperial and Hellenistic period,
and, on the other hand, to follow, across the years, ancient works, themes,
and images as they evolved in the Western tradition. Finally, it is my hope
that this history of Hellenistic and Roman thought I am now going to present
to you reflects the spirit and the profound orientation of Courcelle's teaching
and work.
According to the scheme given by Petrus Ramus, I have just spoken of what
he himself called the ratio muneris officiique 11ostri: the object and method of
the teaching entrusted to me. In the title of my chair, the word tliought can
seem very vague; indeed it can be applied to an immense and undefined
domain ranging from politics to art, from poetry to science and 11hi ln11011hy,
or religion and magic. In any event, the term invites one to 11111kl1 hr1,111h1 11king
Forms of Life and Forms of Discourse 53
excursions into the vast world of wondrous and fascinating works produced
during the great period of the history o( humanity that I propose to study.
Perhaps we will accept this invitation from time to time, but our intention is
to turn to the essential, to recognize the typical or the significant, to attempt
to grasp the Urphiinomene, as Goethe would say. And specifically, philosophia,
the way the term was understood then, is one of the typical and significant
phenomena of the Greco-Roman world. It is this above all which engages our
attention. Nevertheless, we have preferred to speak of "Heilenistic and Roman
thought" to reserve the right to follow this philosophia in its most varied
manifestations and above all to eliminate the preconceptions the word
philosophy may evoke in the modem mind.
"Hellenistic and Roman": these words themselves open an immense period
before us. Our history begins with the highly symbolic event represented by
Alexander's fantastic expedition and with the emergence of the world called
Hellenistic, that is, with the emergence of this new form of Greek civilization
beginning from the moment when Alexander's conquests and, in their wake,
the rise of kingdoms extended this civilization into the barbarian world from
Egypt to the borders of India, and then brought it into contact with the most
diverse nations and civilizations. The result is a kind of distance, a historical
distance, between Hellenistic thought and the Greek tradition preceding it.
Our history then covers the rise of Rome, which will lead to the destruction
of the Hellenistic kingdoms, brought to completion in 30 BC with Cleopatra's
death. After that will come the expansion of the Roman empire, the rise and
triumph of Christianity, the barbarian invasions, and the end of the Western
empire.
We have just traversed a millennium. But from the standpoint of the
history of thought, this long period must be treated as a whole. Indeed it is
impossible to know Hellenistic thought without recourse to later documents,
those of the imperial era and late antiquity, which reveal it to us; and it is
equally impossible to understand Roman thought without taking its Greek
background into account.
We need to recognize from the outset that almost all of Hellenistic
literature, principally its philosophical productions, has disappeared. The
Stoic philosopher Chrysippus, to cite only one example, among many, wrote
seven hundred works, all of which are lost; only a few fragments have come
down to us. We would undoubtedly have a very different idea of Hellenistic
philosophy if this gigantic catastrophe had not occurred. How can we hope
to compensate in some way for this irreparable loss? Obviously, there is the
chance that discoveries might sometimes bring unknown texts to light. For
example, in the mid-eighteenth century, an Epicurean library was found at
Herculaneum. It contained texts of remarkable interest, not only for the
knowledge it provided of that school but also regarding Stoicism and
Plntuni111n. l•:ven todoy the Institute of Papyrology in Naples continues to

mine, in an exemplary manner, these precious documents, endlessly improving
both the texts and the commentaries. Another example: during the
excavations, led for fifteen years by our colleague Paul Bernard in A"i
Khanoun, near the border between Afghanistan and the USSR, to find the
remains of a Hellenistic town of the kingdom of Bactrian, a philosophical text,
unfortunately terribly mutilated, was discovered. The presence of such a
document in such a place suffices, furthermore, to make one recognize the
extraordinary expansion of Hellenism brought on by the Alexandrian conquests.
Most likely it dates from the third or second century BC and
represents a fragment, unfortunately very difficult to read, of a dialogue in
which it is possible to recognize a passage i nspired by the Aristotelian
tradition.2
Except for finds of this type, which are extremely rare, one is obliged to
exploit existing texts to their fullest, which often are of a much later date, in
order to find information about the Hellenistic period. Obviously, it is
necessary to begin with the Greek texts. Despite many excellent studies, much
remains to be done in this area. For example, the collections of philosophical
fragments that have come down to us need to be completed or updated. Hans
von Arnim's collection of fragments from the earliest Stoics is exactly eighty
years old and requires serious revision. Moreover, there exists no collection
of fragments for the Academicians from the period that runs from Arccsilas
to Philo of Larissa. On the other hand, mines of information, such as the
works of Philo of Alexandria, Galen, Athenaeus, and Lucian, or the commentaries
on Plato and Aristotle written at the end of antiquity, have never been
systematically made use of. But the Latin writers are also indispensable to this
line of inquiry. For although the Latinists do not always agree, one has to
admit that Latin literature, except for the historians (and even there!), is
comprised largely of either translations, paraphrases, or imitations of Greek
texts. Sometimes this is completely evident, for one can compare line by line
and word for word the Greek originals that were translated or paraphrased by
the Latin writers; sometimes the Latin writers themselves also quote their
Greek sources; sometimes, finally, one can legitimately speculate about these
influences with the help of reliable evidence. Thanks to the Latin writers, a
large part of Hellenistic thought was preserved. Without Cicero, Lu<..Tetius,
Seneca, or Aulus Gellius, many aspects of the philosophy of the Epicureans,
Stoics, and Academicians would be irretrievably lost. The Latins of the
Christian period are moreover just as precious: without Marius Victorious,
Augustine, Ambrose of Milan, Macrobius, Boethius, or Martianus Capella, how
many Greek sources would be completely unknown to us! Two projects are thus
inseparable: on the one hand, to explain Latin thought in light of its Greek
background, and, on the other hand, to rediscover Greek thought, which has
been lost to us, in the works of Latin writers. If both these tnsk11 11rc 111 he <.'Rrricd
out, any separation of Gr<.'Ck and Latin scholarship is tot nllr impc11111ihlr.
Forms of Life and Forms of Discourse 55
Here we are witness to the great cultural event of the West, the emergence
of a Latin philosophical language translated from the Greek. Once again, it
would be necessary to make a systematic study of the formation of this
technical vocabulary that, thanks to Cicero, Seneca, Tertullian, Victorinus,
Calcidius, Augustine, and Boethius, would leave its mark, by way of the
Middle Ages, on the birth of modern thought. Can it be hoped that one day,
with current technical means, it will be possible to compile a complete lexicon
of the correspondences of philosophical terminology in Greek and Latin?
Furthermore, lengthy commentaries would be needed, for the most interesting
task would be to analyze the shifts in meaning that take place in the
movement from one language to another. In the case of the ontological
vocabulary the translation of ousia by subs1an1ia, for example, is justly famous
and has again recently inspired some remarkable studies. This brings us once
more to a phenomenon we discretely alluded to earlier with the word
phi/osophia, and which we will encounter throughout the present discussion:
the misunderstandings, shifts or losses in meaning, the reinterpretations,
sometimes even to the point of misreadings, that arise once tradition,
translation, and exegesis coexist. So our history of Hellenistic and Roman
thought will consist above all in recognizing and analyzing the evolution of
meanings and significance.
It is precisely the need to explain this evolution that justifies our intention
to study this period as a whole. Translations from the Greek into Latin are
indeed only a particular aspect of this vast process of unification, that is, of
Hellenization, of the different cultures of the Mediterranean world, Europe,
and Asia Minor that took place progressively from the fourth century BC up
until the end of the ancient world. Hellenic thought had the strange capacity
to absorb the most diverse mythical and conceptual themes. All the cultures
of the Mediterranean world thus eventually expressed themselves in the
categories of Hellenic thought, but at the price of important shifts in meaning
that distorted the content of the myths, the values, and .the wisdom of
each culture, as well as the content of the Hellenic tradition itself. First
the Romans, who were able to retain their language, then the Jews, and
then the Christians fell into this sort of trap. Such was the price for the
creation of the remarkable linguistic and cultural community that characterizes
the Greco-Roman world. This process of unification also ensured a
surprising continuity at the heart of philosophical and religious literary
traditions.
This evolutionary continuity and progressive unification can be seen most
remarkably in the area of philosophy. At the beginning of the Hellenistic
period an extraordinary proliferation of schools emerged in the wake of the
Sophist movement and the Socratic experience. But beginning with the
third ccntui·y BC a kind of sorting out occurred. In Athens the only schools
10 Kurvivc were 1 h0Kc whoKc founders h11d thought to establish them as
56 Method
well-organized institutions: the school of Plato, the school of Aristotle and
Theophrastus, the school of Epicurus, and that of Zeno and Chrysippus. In
addition to these four schools there were two movements that are primarily
spiritual traditions: Skepticism and Cynicism. After the institutional foundations
of the schools in Athens collapsed at the end of the Hellenistic period,
private schools and even officially subsidized teaching posts continued to be
established throughout the empire, and here the spiritual traditions of their
founders were their reference points. Thus, for six centuries, from the third
century BC until the third century AD, we witness a surprising stability
among the six traditions we have just mentioned. However, beginning with
the third century AD, Platonism, in the culmination of a movement underway
since the first century, yet again at the price of subtle shifts in meaning and
numerous reinterpretations, came to absorb both Stoicism and Aristotelianism
in an original synthesis, while all the other traditions were to become
marginal. This unifying phenomenon is of major historical importance.
Thanks to the writers of lesser antiquity but also to the Arab translations and
the Byzantine tradition, this Neoplatonist synthesis was to dominate all the
thought of the Middle Ages and Renaissance and was to provide, in some
fashion, the common denominator among Jewish, Christian, and Moslem
theologies and mysticisms.
We have just given a very brief outline of the main paths of the history of
the philosophical schools of antiquity. But as a history of ancient phi/osophia,
our history of Hellenistic and Roman thought is less focused on studying the
doctrinal diversities and particularities of these different schools than it is on
attempting to describe the very essence of the phenomenon of philosophia and
finding the traits shared by the "philosopher" or by "philosophizing" in
antiquity. We must try to recognize in some way the strangeness of this
phenomenon, in order then to try to understand better the strangeness of its
permanence throughout the whole history of Western thought. Why, you may
ask, speak of strangeness when philosop/1ia is a very general and common
thing? Doesn't a philosophical quality color all of Hellenistic and Roman
thought? Weren't the generalization and popularization of philosophy characteristics
of the time? Philosophy is found everywhere - in speeches, novels,
poetry, science, art. However, we must not be deceived. These general ideas,
these commonplaces that may adorn a literary work, and true "philosophizing"
are separated by an abyss. Indeed, to be a philosopher implies a rupture
with what the skeptics called bios, that is, daily life, when they criticized other
philosophers for not observing the common conduct of life, the usual manner
of seeing and acting, which for the Skeptics consisted in respecting customs
and laws, practicing a craft or plying a trade, satisfying bodily needs, and
having the faith in appearances indispensable to action . It iH true: that even
while the Skeptics chose to conform to the: common cundm·1 of life, they
remained philosophers, since they pract iced an clCcrciNC' dt•11111111l ln11 1111mc1 hi111<
Forms of Life and Forms of Discourse 57
rather strange, the suspension of judgment, and aiming at a goal, uninterrupted
tranquillity and serenity of the soul, that the commo1.1 conduct of life
hardly knew.
This very rupture between the philosopher and the conduct of everyday life
is strongly felt by non-philosophers. In the works of comic and satiric authors,
philosophers were portrayed as bizarre, if not dangerous characters. It is true,
moreover, that throughout all of antiquity the number of charlatans who
passed themselves off as philosophers must have been considerable, and
Lucian, for example, freely exercised his wit at their expense. Jurists too
considered philosophers a race apart. According to Ulpian, in the litigation
between professors and their debtors the authorities did not need to concern
themselves with philosophers, for these people professed to despise money. A
regulation made by the emperor Antoninus Pious on salaries and compensations
notes that if a philosopher haggles over his possessions, he shows he is
no philosopher. Thus philosophers are strange, a race apart. Strange indeed
are those Epicureans, who lead a frugal life, practicing a total equality between
the men and women inside their philosophical circle - and even between
married women and courtesans; strange, too, those Roman Stoics who
disinterestedly administer the provinces of the empire entrusted to them and
are the only ones to take seriously the laws promulgated against excess;
strange as well this Roman Platonist, the Senator Rogatianus, a disciple of
Plotinus, who on the very day he is to assume his functions as praetor gives
up his responsibilities, abandons all his possessions, frees his slaves, and cats
only every other day. Strange indeed all those philosophers whose behavior,
without being inspired by religion, nonetheless completely breaks with the
customs and habits of most mortals.
By the time of the Platonic dialogues Socrates was called atopos, that is,
"unclassifiable." What makes him atopos is precisely the fact that he is a
"philo-sopher" in the etymological sense of the word; that is, he is in love
with wisdom. For wisdom, says Diotima in Plato's Symposium, is not a human
state, it is a state of perfection of being and knowledge that can only be divine.
It is the love of this wisdom, which is foreign to the world, that makes the
philosopher a stranger in it.
So each school will elaborate its rational depiction of this state of perfection
in the person of the sage, and each will make an effort to portray him. It is
true that this transcendent ideal will be deemed almost inaccessible; according
to some schools there never was a wise man, while others say that perhaps
there were one or two of them, such as Epicurus, this god among men, and
still others maintain that man can only attain this state during rare, fleeting
moments. In this transcendent norm established by reason, each school will
cxprci;s its own vision of the world, its own style of life, and its idea of the
perfect man . ThiN is why in every school the description of this transcendent
norm ultim1uclv coindth.'11 wit h the rational idea of God. Michelet remarked
58 Method
very profoundly, "Greek religion culminated with its true god, the sage." We
can interpret this remark, which Michelet does not develop, by noting that
the moment philosophers achieve a rational conception of God based on the
model of the sage, Greece surpasses its mythical representation of its gods. Of
course, classical descriptions of the sage depict the circumstances of human
life and take pleasure in describing how the sage would respond to this or that
situation, but the beatitude the wise man resolutely maintains throughout his
difficulties is that of God himself. Seneca asks what the sage's life would be
in solitude, if he were in prison or exile, or cast upon the shores of a desert
island. And he answers that it would be the life of Zeus (that is, for the Stoics,
the life of universal Reason), when, at the end of each cosmic period, after
the activity of nature has ceased, he devotes himself freely to his thoughts;
like Zeus the sage would enjoy the happiness of being self-sufficient. Thus
the thoughts and will of the Stoic wise man completely coincide with the
thoughts, will, and development of Reason immanent to the evolution of the
Cosmos. As for the Epicurean sage, he, like the gods, watches the infinity of
worlds arising out of atoms in the infinite void; nature is sufficient for his
needs, and nothing ever disturbs the peace of his soul. For their part, the
Platonic and Aristotelian sages raise themselves in subtly different ways, by
their life of the mind, to the realm of the divine Mind itself.
Now we have a better understanding of atopia, the strangeness of the
philosopher in the human world. One does not know how to classify him, for
he is neither a sage nor a man like other men. He knows that the normal,
natural state of men should be wisdom, for wisdom is nothing more than the
vision of things as they are, the vision of the cosmos as it is in the light of
reason, and wisdom is also nothing more than the mode of being and living
that should correspond to this vision. But the philosopher also knows that this
wisdom is an ideal state, almost inaccessible. For such a man, daily life, as it
is organized and lived by other men, must necessarily appear abnormal, like
a state of madness, unconsciousness, and ignorance of reality. And nonetheless
he must live this life every day, in this world in which he feels himself a
stranger and in which others perceive him to be one as well. And it is
precisely in this daily life that he must seek to attain that way of life which is
utterly foreign to the everyday world. The result is a perpetual conflict
between the philosopher's effort to see things as they are from the standpoint
of universal nature and the conventional vision of things underlying human
society, a conflict between the life one should live and the customs and
conventions of daily life. This conflict can never be totally resolved. The
Cynics, in their refusal of the world of social convention, opt for a total break.
On the contrary, others, such as the Skeptics, fully accept socinl convention,
while keeping their inner peace. Others, the Epicure11ni;, for c111ur1plc, 11ttempt

greatest difficulties, to live their everyday and even their public lives in a
"philosophical" manner. In any event, for all of them, the philosophical life
will be an effort to live and think according to the norm of wisdom, it will
be a movement, a progression, though a never-ending one, toward this
transcendent state.
Each school, then, represents a form of life defined by an ideal of wisdom.
The result is that each one has its corresponding fundamental inner attitude
- for example, tension for the Stoics or relaxation for the Epicureans - and
its own manner of speaking, such as the Stoic use of percussive dialectic or
the abundant rhetoric of the Academicians. But above all every school
practices exercises designed to ensure spiritual progress toward the ideal state
of wisdom, exercises of reason that will be, for the soul, analagous to the
athlete's training or to the application of a medical cure. Generally, they
consist, above all, of self-control and meditation. Self-control is fundamentally
being attentive to oneself: an unrelaxing vigilance for the Stoics, the renunciation
of unnecessary desires for the Epicureans. It always involves an effort
of will, thus faith in moral freedom and the possibility of self-improvement;
an acute moral consciousness honed by spiritual direction and the practice of
examining one's conscience; and lastly, the kind of practical exercises
described with such remarkable precision particularly by Plutarch: controlling
one's anger, curiosity, speech, or love of riches, beginning by working on what
is easiest in order gradually to acquire a firm and stable character.
Of first importance is "meditation," which is the "exercise" of reason;
moreover, the two words are synonymous from an etymological point of view.
Unlike the Buddhist meditation practices of the Far East, Greco-Roman
philosophical meditation is not linked to a corporeal attitude but is a purely
rational, imaginative, or intuitive exercise that can take extremely varied
forms. First of all it is the memorization and assimilation of the fundamental
dogmas and rules of life of the school. Thanks to this exercise, the vision of
the world of the person who strives for spiritual progress will be completely
transformed. In particular, philosophical meditation on the essential dogmas
of physics, for example the Epicurean contemplation of the genesis of worlds
in the infinite void or the Stoic contemplation of the rational and necessary
unfolding of cosmic events, can lead to an exercise of the imagination in
which human things appear of little importance in the immensity of space and
time. It is necessary to try to have these dogmas and rules for living "ready
to hand" if one is to be able to conduct oneself like a philosopher under all
of life's circumstances. Moreover, one has to be able to imagine these
circumstances in advance in order to be ready for the shock of events. In all
t he schools, for various reasons, philosophy will be especially a meditation
u1mn death and an attentive concentration on the present moment in order to
t•njoy it or live it in full consciousncs11. In all these exercises, all the means
oh1 11hu1hle hv dialectic 1111J rhet oric will he util i:1.cd to obtain the maximum

effect. In particular, this consciously willed application of rhetoric explains the
impression of pessimism that some readers believe they discern in the
Meditations of Marcus Aurelius. All images are suitable for him if they strike
the imagination and make the reader conscious of the illusions and conventions
of mankind.
The relationship between theory and practice in the philosophy of this
period must be understood from the perspective of these exercises of
meditation. Theory is never considered an end in itself; it is clearly and
decidedly put in the service of practice. Epicurus is explicit on this point: the
goal of the science of nature is to obtain the soul's serenity. Or else, as among
the Aristotelians, one is more attached to theoretical activity considered as a
way of life that brings an almost divine pleasure and happiness than to the
theories themselves. Or, as in the Academicians' school or for the skeptics,
theoretical activity is a critical activity. Or, as among the Platonists, abstract
theory is not considered to be true knowledge: as Porphyry says, "Beatific
contemplation does not consist of the accumulation of arguments or a
storehouse of learned knowledge, but in us theory must become nature and
life itself." And, according to Plotinus, one cannot know the soul if one does
not purify oneself of one's passions in order to experience in oneself the
transcendence of the soul with respect to the body, and one cannot know the
principle of all things if one has not had the experience of union with it.
To make possible these exercises in meditation, beginners are exposed to
maxims or summaries of the principal dogmas of the school. Epicurus' Letters,
which Diogenes Laertius preserved for us, are intended to play this role. To
ensure that these dogmas have a great spiritual effectiveness, they must be
presented in the form of short, striking formulae, as in Epicurus' Principal
Doctrines, or in a rigorously systematic form, such as the Letter to Herodotus
by the same author, which permitted the disciple to grasp in a kind of single
intuition the essentials of the doctrine in order to have it more easily at hand.
In this case the concern for systematic coherence was subordinated to spiritual
effectiveness.
The dogmas and methodological principles of each school are not open to
discussion. In this period, to philosophize is to choose a school, convert to i ts
way of life, and accept its dogmas. This is why the core of the fundamental
dogmas and rules of life for Platonism, Aristotelianism, Stoicism, and
Epicureanism remained unchanged throughout antiquity. Even the scientists
of antiquity always were affiliated with a philosophical school: the development
of their mathematical and astronomical theorems changed nothing of the
fundamental principles of the school to which they claimed allegiance.
This does not mean that theoretical reflection and elaboration arc absent
from the philosophical life. However, this activity ncVl'r l'ncndcd to the

points issuing from them on which there was not unanimity in the school.
This type of investigation is always reserved for the more advanced students,
for whom it is an exercise of reason that strengthens them in their philosophical
life. Chrysippus, for example, felt himself capable of finding the
arguments justifying the Stoic dogmas established by Zeno and Cleanthes,
which led him, moreover, to disagree with them not concerning these dogmas
but on the way of establishing them. Epicurus, too, leaves the discussion and
study of points of detail to the more advanced students, and much later the
same attitude will be found in Origen, who assigns the "spiritual ones" the
task of seeking, as he himself says, by way of exercise, the "hows" and "whys"
and of discussing these obscure and secondary questions. This effort of
theoretical reflection can result in the composition of enormous works.
Obviously, these systematic treaties and scholarly commentaries, such as
Origen's treatise on Principles or Proclus' Elements of Theology, very legitimately
attract the attention of the historian of philosophy. The study of the
progress of thought in these great texts must be one of the principal tasks in
a reflection on the phenomenon of philosophy. However, it must be recognized
that generally speaking the philosophical works of Greco-Roman
antiquity almost always perplex the contemporary reader. I do not refer only
to the general public, but even to specialists in the field. One could compile
a whole anthology of complaints made against ancient authors by modern
commentators, who reproach them for their bad writing, contradictions, and
lack of rigor and coherence. Indeed, it is my astonishment both at these critics
and at the universality and persistence of the phenomenon they condemn that
inspires the reflections I have just presented, as well as those I wish to turn
to now.
It seems to me, indeed, that in order to understand the works of the
philosophers of antiquity we must take account of all the concrete conditions
in which they wrote, all the constraints that weighed upon them: the
framework of the school, the very nature of philosopl1ia, literary genres,
rhetorical rules, dogmatic imperatives, and traditional modes of reasoning.
One cannot read an ancient author the way one does a contemporary author
(which does not mean that contemporary authors are easier to understand
than those of antiquity). In fact, the works of antiquity are produced under
entirely different conditions than those of their modern counterparts. I will
not discuss the problem of material support: the volumen or codex, each of
which has its own constraints. But I do want to stress the fact that written
works in the period we study arc never completely free of the constraints
imposed by oral transmission. In fact, it is an exaggeration to assert, as has
still been done recently, that Greco-Roman civilization early on became a
civililnt ion of writing and that one can thus treat, methodologically, the
philmmphknl workN of nnt iquit y l ike nny othc:r written work .
62 Method
For the written works of this period remain closely tied to oral conduct.
Often they were dictated to a scribe. And they were intended to be read aloud,
either by a slave reading to his master or by the reader himself, since in
antiquity reading customarily meant reading aloud, emphasizing the rhythm
of the phrase and the sounds of the words, which the author himself had
already experienced when he dictated his work. The ancients were extremely
sensitive to these effects of sound. Few philosophers of the period we study
resisted this magic of the spoken word, not even the Stoics, not even Plotinus.
So if oral literature before the practice of writing imposed rigorous constraints
on expression and obliged one to use certain rhythmic, stereotypic, and
traditional formulae conveying images and thoughts independent, if one may
say so, of the author's will, this phenomenon is not foreign to written
literature to the degree that it too must concern itself with rhythm .md sound.
To take an extreme but very revealing example, the use of poetic meter in De
rerum nalura dictates the recourse to certain somewhat stereotypical formulae
and keeps Lucretius from freely using the technical vocabulary of Epicureanism
that he should have employed.
This relationship between the written and the spoken word thus explains
certain aspects of the works of antiquity. Quite often the work proceeds by
the associations of ideas, without systematic rigor. The work retains the starts
and stops, the hesitations, and the repetitions of spoken discourse. Or else,
after re-reading what he has written, the author introduces a somewhat forced
systematization by adding transitions, introductions, or conclusions to different
parts of the work.
More than other literature, philosophical works arc linked to oral transmission
because ancient philosophy itself is above all oral in character.
Doubtless there are occasions when someone was converted by reading a
book, but one would then hasten to the philosopher to hear him speak,
question him, and carry on discussions with him and other disciples in a
community that always serves as a place of discussion. In matters of
philosophical teaching, writing is only an aid to memory, a last resort that will
never replace the living word.
True education is always oral because only the spoken word makes dialogue
possible, that is, it makes it possible for the disciple to discover the truth
himself amid the interplay of questions and answers and also for the master
to adapt his teaching to the needs of the disciple. A number of philosophers,
and not the least among them, did not wish to write, thinking, as did
Plato and without doubt correctly, that what is inscribed in the soul by the
spoken word is more real and lasting than letters drawn on papyrus or
parchment.
Thus for the most part the literary productions of the phi loNophc:rN arc 11
preparation, extension, or echo of their spoken lessons nnd a rl' n111rked hy the
limitations and constraints imposed by such n situnt ion.
Forms of Life and Forms of Discourse 63
Some of these works, moreover, are directly related to the activity of
teaching. They may be either a summary the teacher drafted. in preparing his
course or notes taken by students during the course, or else they may be texts
written with care but intended to be read during the course by the professor
or a student. In all these cases, the general movement of thought, its
unfolding, what could be called its own temporality, is regulated by the
temporality of speech. It is a very heavy constraint, whose full rigor I am
experiencing today.
Even texts that were written in and for themselves are closely linked to the
activity of teaching, and their literary genre reflects the methods of the
schools. One of the exercises esteemed in the schools consists of discussing,
either dialectically, that is, in the form of questions and answers, or
rhetorically, that is, in a continuous discourse, what were called "theses," that
is, theoretical positions presented in the form of questions: Is death an
evil? Is the wise man ever angry? This provides both training in the mastery
of the spoken word and a properly philosophical exercise. The largest portion
of the philosophical works of antiquity, for example those of Cicero, Plutarch,
Seneca, Plotinus, and more generally those classified by the moderns as
belonging to what they called the genre of diatribe, correspond to this
exercise. They discuss a specific question, which is posed at the outset of the
work and which normally requires a yes or no answer. In these works, the
course of thought consists in going back to general principles that have been
accepted in the school and arc capable of resolving the problem in question.
This search to find principles to solve a given problem thus encloses thought
within narrowly defined limits. Different works written by the same author
and gu ided according to this "zetctic" method, "one that seeks," will not
necessarily be coherent on all points because the details of the argument in
each work will be a function of the question asked.
Another school exercise is the reading and exegesis of the authoritative texts
of each school. Many literary works, particularly the long commentaries from
the end of antiquity, are the result of this exercise. More generally, a large
number of the philosophical works from that time utilize a mode of exegetical
thinking. Most of the time, discussing a "thesis" consists in discussing not
the problem in itself but the meaning that one should give to Plato's or
Aristotle's statements concerning this problem. Once this convention has been
taken into account, one docs in fact discuss the question in some depth, but
this is done by skillfully giving Platonic or Aristotelian statements the
meanings that support the very solution one wishes to give to the problem
under consideration. Any possible meaning is true provided it coheres with
the t ruth one believes one has discovered in the text. In this way there slowly
emcqccs, in the spiritual tradition of each school, but in Platonism above all,
it 11chola!itici1m1 which, relying on argument from authority, builds up gigantic
doctrinal cdi fic·cK by mcanK of an ext raordinary rational reflection on the
64 Method
fundamental dogmas. It is precisely the third philosophical literary genre, the
systematic treatise, that proposes a rational ordering of the whole of doctrine,
which sometimes is presented, as in the case of Proclus, as a more geometrico,
that is, according to the model of Euclid's Elements. In this case one no longer
returns to the principles necessary to resolve a specific question but sets down
the principles directly and deduces their consequences. These works are, so
to speak, "more written" than the others. They often comprise a long
sequence of books and are marked by a vast, overarching design. But, like the
Summae theologicae of the Middle-Ages that they prefigure, these works must
themselves also be understood from the perspective of dialectical and
exegetical scholarly exercises.
Unlike their modem counterparts, none of these philosophical productions,
even the systematic works, is addressed to everyone, to a general audience,
but they are intended first of all for the group formed by the members of the
school; often they echo problems raised by the oral teaching. Only works of
propaganda are addressed to a wider audience.
Moreover, while he writes the philosopher often extends his activity as
spiritual director that he exercises in his school. In such cases the work may
be addressed to a particular disciple who needs encouragement or who finds
himself in a special difficulty. Or else the work may be adapted to the spiritual
level of the addressees. Not all the details of the system can be explained to
beginners; many details can be revealed only to those further along the path.
Above all, the work, even if it is apparently theoretical and systematic, is
written not so much to inform the reader of a doctrinal content but to form
him, to make him traverse a certain itinerary in the course of which he will
make spiritual progress. This procedure is clear in the works of Plotinus and
Augustine, in which all the detours, starts and stops, and digressions of the
work are formative elements. One must always approach a philosophical work
of antiquity with this idea of spiritual progress in mind. For the Platonists,
for example, even mathematics is used to train the soul to raise itself from the
sensible to the intelligible. The overall organization of a work and its mode
of exposition may always answer to such preoccupations.
Such then are the many constraints that are exercised on the ancient author
and that often perplex the modem reader with respect to both what is said
and the way in which it is said. Understanding a work of antiquity requires
placing it in the group from which it emanates, in the tradition of its dogmas,
its literary genre, and requires understanding its goals. One must attempt to
distinguish what the author was required to say, what he could or could not
say, and, above all, what he meant to say. For the ancient author's art consists
in his skillfully using, in order to arrive at his goals, all of the constraints that
weigh upon him as well as the models furnished by the i-rnllition. MoHt of the
time, furthermore, he uses not only ideas, images, nml p111 1�rn• of nrl(mncnt

pure and simple to quotation or paraphrase, this practice includes - and this
is the most characteristic example - the literal use of foi;mulae or words
employed by the earlier tradition to which the author often gives a new
meaning adapted to what he wants to say. This is the way that Philo, a Jew,
uses Platonic formulae to comment on the Bible, or Ambrose, a Christian,
translates Philo's text to present Christian doctrines, the way that Plotinus
uses words and whole sentences from Plato to convey his experience. What
matters first of all is the prestige of the ancient and traditional formula, and
not the exact meaning it originally had. The idea itself holds less interest than
the prefabricated elements in which the writer believes he recognizes his own
thought, elements that take on an unexpected meaning and purpose when
they are integrated into a literary whole. This sometimes brilliant reuse of
prefabricated elements gives an impression of "bricolage," to take up a word
currently in fashion, not only among anthropologists hut among biologists.
Thought evolves by incorporating prefabricated and pre-existing elements,
which are given new meaning as they become integrated into a rational
system. It is difficult to say what is most extraordinary about this process of
integration: contingency, chance, irrationality, the very absurdity resulting
from the elements used, or, on the contrary, the strange power of reason to
integrate and systematize these disparate elements and to give them a new
meaning.
An extremely significant example of this conferring of a new meaning can
be seen in the final lines of Edmund Husserl's Cartesian Meditations.
Summing up his own theory, Husserl writes, "The Delphic oracle yvro6t
OEavi-ov [know thyself] has acquired a new meaning .... One must first lose
the world by the etrov] [for Husserl, the 'phenomenological bracketing' of
the world], in order to regain it in a universal self-consciousness. Noli joras
ire, says St Augustine, in te redi, in interiore homine habitat veritas." This
sentence of Augustine's, "Do not lose your way from without, return to
yourself, it is in the inner man that truth dwells," offers Husserl a convenient
formula for expressing and summarizing his own conception of consciousness.
It is true that Husserl gives this sentence a new meaning. Augustine's "inner
man" becomes the "transcendental ego" for Husserl, a knowing subject who
regains the world in "a universal self-consciousness. " Augustine never could
have conceived of his "inner man" in these terms. And nonetheless one
understands why Husserl was tempted to use this formula. For Augustine's
sentence admirably summarizes the whole spirit of Greco-Roman philosophy
that prepares the way for both Descartes' Meditations and Husserl's Cartesian
Meditations. And by the same procedure of taking up such a formula again,
we ourselves can apply to ancient philosophy what Husserl says of his own
1>hilmmphy: t.he Delphic oracle "Know thyself" has acquired a new meaning.
For 11 11 the 11hi loso1>hy of which we have spoken also gives a new meaning to
l hl' I >clphic form11l11. Thi11 new mc11ninir already appeared among the Stoics,
66 Method
for whom the philosopher recognizes the presence of divine reason in the
human self and who opposes his moral consciousness, which depends on him
alone, to the rest of the universe. This new meaning appeared even more
clearly among the Neoplatonists, who identify what they call the true self with
the founding intellect of the world and even with the transcendent unity that
founds all thought and all reality. In Hellenistic and Roman thought this
movement, of which Husserl speaks, is thus already outlined, according to
which one loses the world in order to find it again in universal self-consciousness.
Thus Husserl consciously and explicitly presents himself as the heir to
the tradition of "Know thyself " that runs from Socrates to Augustine to
Descartes. But that is not all. This example, borrowed from Husserl, better
enables us to understand concretely how these conferrals of new meaning can
be realized in antiquity as well. Indeed, the expression in interiore homine
habitat veritas, as my friend and colleague Goulven Madec has pointed out to
me, is an allusion to a group of words borrowed from chapter 3, verses 16
and 1 7, of Paul's letter to the Ephesians, from an ancient Latin version, to be
exact, in which the text appears as in interiore homi11e Christum habitare. But
these words are merely a purely material conjunction that exists only in this
Latin version and do not correspond to the contents of Paul's thought, for
they belong to two different clauses of the sentence. On the one hand, Paul
wishes for Christ to dn1el/ in the heart of his disciples through faith, and, on
the other hand, in the preceding clause, he wishes for God to allow his
disciples to be strengthened by the divine Spirit in the inner man, in interiorem
hominem, as the Vulgate has it. So the earlier Latin version, by combining in
interiure homine and Christum habitare, was either a mistranslation or was
miscopied. The Augustinian formula, in interiore homine habitat veritas, is thus
created from a group of words that do not represent a unified meaning in St
Paul's text; but taken in itself, this group of words has a meaning for
Augustine, and he explains it in the context of De vera religione where he uses
it: the inner man, that is, the human spirit, discovers that what permits him
to think and reason is the truth, that is, d ivine reason - that is, for Augustine,
Christ, who dwells in, who is present within, the human spirit. In this way
the formula takes on a Platonic meaning. We see how, from St Paul to
Husserl, by way of Augustine, a group of words whose unity was originally
only purely material, or which was a misunderstanding of the Latin translator,
was given a new meaning by A ugustine, and then by Husserl, thus taking its
place in the vast tradition of the deepening of the idea of self-consciousness.
This example borrowed from Husserl allows us to touch on the importance
of what in Western thought is called the topos. Literary theories use the term
to refer to the formulae, images, and metaphors that forcibly impose
themselves on the writer and the thinker in such a w11y 1 h11t t he LINC of these
prefabricated models seems indispensable tu them in 1mlc�1· tn he 11hlc to
express their own thoughts.
Fonns of Life and Fonns of Discourse 67
Our Western thought has been nourished in this way and still lives off a
relatively limited number of formulae and metaphors borrowed from the
various traditions of which it is the result. For example, there are maxims that
encourage a certain inner attitude such as "Know thyself'; those which have
long guided our view of nature: "Nature makes no leaps," "Nature delights
in diversity." There are metaphors such as "The force of truth," "The world
as a book" (which is perhaps extended in the conception of the genetic code
as a text). There are biblical formulae such as "I am who I am," which have
profoundly marked the idea of God. The point I strongly wish to emphasize
here is the following: these prefabricated models, of which I have just given
some examples, were known during the Renaissance and in the modern world
in the very form that they had in the Hellenistic and Roman tradition, and
they were originally understood during the Renaissance and in the modern
world with the very meaning these models of thought had during the
Greco-Roman period, especially at the end of antiquity. So these models
continue to explain many aspects of our contemporary thought and even the
very significance, sometimes unexpected, that we find in antiquity. For
example, the classical prejudice, which has done so much damage to the study
of late Greek and Latin literatures, is an invention of the Greco-Roman
period, which created the model of a canon of classical authors as a reaction
against mannerism and the baroque, which, at that time, were called
"Asianism." But if the classical prejudice already existed during the Hellenistic
and especially imperial eras, this is precisely because the distance we feel
with respect to classical Greece also appeared at that time. It is precisely this
Hellenistic spirit, this distance, in some ways modern, through which, for
example, the traditional myths become the objects of scholarship or of
philosophical and moral interpretations. It is through Hellenistic and Roman
thought, particularly that of late antiquity, that the Renaissance was to
perceive Greek tradition. This fact was to be of decisive importance for the
birth of modern European thought and art. In another respect contemporary
hermeneutic theories that, proclaiming the autonomy of the written text, have
constructed a veritable tower of Babel of interpretations where all meanings
become possible, come straight out of the practices of ancient exegesis, about
which I spoke earlier. Another example: for our late colleague Roland Barthes,
"many features of our literature, of our teaching, of our institutions of
language ... would be elucidated and understood differently if we fully knew
... the rhetorical code that gave its language to our culture." This is
completely true, and we could add that this knowledge would perhaps enable
us to be conscious of the fact that in their methods and modes of expression
our human sciences often operate in a way completely analogous to the
mmlcl11 of ancient rhetoric.
Our hi111ory of Hellenistic and Roman thought should therefore not only
11 1111l�·:t.c t he movcrm:nt of 1 houl(hl in philosophical works, but it should also
68 Method
be a historical topics that will study the evolution of the meaning of the topoi,
the models of which we have spoken, and the role they have played in the
formation of Western thought. This historical topics should work hard at
discerning the original meanings of the formulae and models and the different
significances that successive reinterpretations have given them.
At first, this historical topics will take for its object of study those works
that were founding models and the literary genres that they created. Euclid's
Elements, for example, served as a model for Proclus's Elements of Theology
but also for Spinoza's Ethics. Plato's Timaeus, itself inspired by pre-Socratic
cosmic poems, served as a model for Lucretius' De rerum natura, and the
eighteenth century, in tum, was to dream of a new cosmic poem that would
exhibit the latest discoveries of science. Augustine's Confessions, as it was
misinterpreted, moreover, inspired an enormous literature up to Rousseau
and the romantics.
This topics could also be a topics of aphorisms: for example, of the maxims
about nature that dominated the scientific imagination until the nineteenth
century. This year [at the ColJege de France], we will study in this way the
aphorism of Heraclitus that is usually phrased as "Nature loves to hide
herself," although this is certainly not the original meaning of the three Greek
words so translated. We will examine the significance this formula takes on
throughout antiquity and later on, as a function of the evolution of the idea
of nature, the very interpretation proposed by Martin Heidegger.
Above all, this historical topics will be a topics about the themes of
meditations of which we spoke a few minutes ago, which have dominated and
still dominate our Western thought. Plato, for example, had defined philosophy
as an exercise for death, understood as the separation of the soul from
the body. For Epicurus this exercise for death takes on a new meaning; it
becomes the consciousness of the finitude of existence that gives an infinite
value to each instant: "Persuade yourself that every new day that dawns will
be your last one. And then you will receive each unhoped for hour with
gratitude." In the perspective of Stoicism, the exercise for death takes on a
different charac.'ter; it invites immediate conversion and makes inner freedom
possible: "Let death be before your eyes each day and you will not have any
base thoughts or excessive desires." A mosaic at the Roman National Museum
is inspired, perhaps ironically, by this meditation, as it depicts a skeleton with
a scythe accompanied by the inscription Gnothi seauton, "Know thyself." Be
that as it may, Christianity will make abundant use of this theme of meditation.
There it can be treated in a manner close to Stoicism, as in this monk's
reflection: "Since the beginning of our conversation, we have come closer to
death. Let us be vigilant while we still have the time." But it changes radically
when it is combined with the properly Christian theme of p11rt ici11ni-ion in
Christ's death. Leaving aside all of the rich Western litemry t r1ulit iun1 No well
illustrated by Mont11igne's chnpter "Thill to philrn111phi1c i11 to ll•11 1·11 111 die,"
Fonns of Life and Forms of Discourse 69
we can go straight to Heidegger in order to rediscover this fundamental
philosophical exercise in his definition of the authenticity of existence as a
lucid anticipation of death.
Linked to the meditation upon death, the theme of the value of the present
instant plays a fundamental role in all the philosophical schools. In short it is
a consciousness of inner freedom. It can be summarized in a formula of this
kind: you need only yourself in order immediately to find inner peace by
ceasing to worry about the past and the future. You can be happy right now,
or you will never be happy. Stoicism will insist on the effort needed to pay
attention to oneself, the joyous acceptance of the present moment imposed on
us by fate. The Epicurean will conceive of this liberation from cares about the
past and the future as a relaxation, a pure joy of existing: "While we are
speaking, jealous time has flown; seize today without placing your trust in
tomorrow." This is Horace's famous laetus in praesens, this "enjoyment of the
pure present," to use Andre Chastel's fine expression about Marsilio Fidno,
who had taken this very formula of Horace's for his motto. Here again the
history of this theme in Western thought is fascinating. I cannot resist the
pleasure of evoking the dialogue between Faust and Helena, the climax of part
two of Goethe's Faust: "Nun schaut der Geist nicht vorwarts, nicht zurilck, I
Die Gegenwart allein ist unser Gluck" ["And so the spirit looks neither ahead
nor behind. The present alone is our joy ... Do not think about your destiny.
Being here is a duty, even though it only be an instant"].
I have come to the end of this inaugural address, which means that I have
j ust completed what in antiquity was called an epideixis, a set speech. It is in
a direct line with those that professors in the time of Libanius, for example,
had to give in order to recruit an audience while at the same time trying to
demonstrate the incomparable worth of their speciality and to display their
eloquence. It would be interesting to investigate the historic paths by which
this ancient practice was transmitted to the first professors at the College de
France. In any case, at this very moment, we are in the process of fully living
a Greco-Roman tradition. Philo of Alexandria said of these sei: speeches that
the lecturer "brought into broad daylight the fruit of long efforts pursued in
private, as painters and sculptors seek, in realizing their works, the applause
of the public." And he opposed this behavior to the true philosophical
instruction in which the teacher adapts his speech to the state of his listeners
and brings them the cures they need in order to be healed.
The concern with individual destiny and spiritual progress, the intransigent
assertion of moral requirements, the call for meditation, the invitation to
seek this inner peace that all the schools, even those of the skeptics, propose
Rs the aim of philosophy, the feeling for the seriousness and grandeur
of existence this seems to me to be what has never been surpassed in
1mdcn1 philmmphy and whnt always remains alive. Perhaps some people will

consciousness we should have of human suffering and misery, and they will
think that the philosopher thereby shows himself to be irremediably foreign
to the world. I would answer simply by quoting this beautiful text by Georges
Friedmann, from 1 942, which offers a glimpse of the possibility of reconciling
the concern for justice and spiritual effort; it could have been written by a
Stoic of antiquity:
Take flight each day! At least for a moment, however brief, as long as
it is intense. Every day a "spiritual exercise," alone or in the company
of a man who also wishes to better himself .... Leave ordinary time
behind. Make an effort to rid yourself of your own passions .... Become
eternal by surpassing yourself. This inner effort is necessary, this
ambition, just. Many are those who are entirely absorbed in militant
politics, in the preparation for the social revolution. Rare, very rare, are
those who, in order to prepare for the revolution, wish to become
worthy of it.1

Philosophy, Exegesis, and Creative
Mistakes
Everyone is familiar with Whitehead's remark: "Western philosophy is
nothing but a series of footnotes to Plato's dialogues." This statement could
be interpreted in two ways: we could take it to mean that Plato's problematics
have made a definitive mark upon Western philosophy, and this would be
true. Alternatively, it could be taken to mean that, in a concrete sense,
Western philosophy has assumed the form of commentaries - be they on Plato
or on other philosophers - and that, more generally speaking, it has taken the
form of exegesis. This, too, is to a very large extent true. It is important to
realize that, for almost two thousand years - from the mid-fourth century BC
to the end of the sixteenth century AD - philosophy was conceived of, above
all, as the exegesis of a small number of texts deriving from "authorities,"
chief among whom were Plato and Aristotle. We are, moreover, j ustified in
asking ourselves if, even after the Cartesian revolution, philosophy does not
still bear traces of its lengthy past, and if, even today, at least to a certain
extent, it has not remained exegesis.
The long period of "exegetical" philosophy is linked to a sociological
phenomenon: the existence of philosophical schools, in which the thought,
life-style, and writings of a master were religiously preserved. This phenomenon
seems already to have existed among the Presocratics, but we are best
able to observe it from Plato on.
Plato had given his Academy an extremely solid material and juridical
organization. The leaders of the school succeeded one another 1 in a continuous
chain until Justinian's closure of the school of Athens in 529, and
throughout this entire period, scholarly activity was carried out according to
fixed, trnditionnl methods. The other great schools, whether Peripatetic,
Stoic, or Epicurean, were organized along similar lines. The writings of each
Kl'hool'K foumler KcrVl'U 1111 t he hnKiN for itK instruction , and it was determined
72 Method
in which order the student should read these writings, in order to acquire the
best possible education. We still have some of the writings in which Platonists
gave advice on the order in which Plato's dialogues were to be read. Thus,
we can tell that from the fourth century BC on, Aristotle's logical writings
were arranged in a definite scholastic order - the Organon - which would not
change until modem times.
Instruction consisted above all in commenting on Plato and Aristotle, using
previous commentaries and adding a new interpretation here and there. In
this regard, we have an interesting testimony from Porphyry about the lessons
of Plotinus:
During his classes, he used to have the commentaries read, perhaps of
Severus or of Cronius or of N umenius or Gaius or Atticus, or of
Peripatetics like Aspasius, Alexander, or whichever other came to hand.
Yet he never repeated anything from these commentaries word for
word, restricted himself to these readings alone. Rather, he himself used
to give a general explanation [theoria] of (Plato's or Aristotle's) text in
his own personal way, which was different from current opinion. In his
investigations, moreover, he brought to bear the spirit of Ammonius.2
The first commentator on Plato's Timaeus seems to have been Crantor
(ca. 330 BC), and Platonic commentators continued their activity until the
end of the Athenian school in the sixth century. From this point, the tradition
was continued, both in the Arab world and in the Latin West, up until the
Renaissance (Marsilio Ficino). As for Aristotle, he was first commented upon
by Andronicus of Rhodes (first century BC), who was the first in a series
extending through the end of the Renaissance, in the person of Zabardella. In
addition to commentaries slriclo sensu, the exegetical activity of the philosophical
schools took the form of dogmatic treatises, devoted to particular points
of exegesis, and manuals designed to serve as introductions to the study of
the masters. Moreover, the end of antiquity witnessed the appearance of other
authorities, in addition to Plato and Aristotle: the authority of Revelations.
For Christians and Jews, this meant primarily the Bible, and for pagan
philosophers, the Chaldaean Oracles. Both Judaism and Christianity sought to
present themselves to the Greek world as philosophies; they thus developed,
in the persons of Philo and Origen respectively, a biblical exegesis analogous
to the traditional pagan exegesis of Plato. For their part, such pagan
commentators on the Clzaldaean Oracles as Porphyry, Iamblichus, and Proclus
did their best to show that the teachings of the "gods" coincided with Plato's
doctrines. If we understand by "theology" the rational exegesis of n sacred
text, then we can say that during this period philosophy was trim11formed into
theology, and it was to stay that way throughoul l hc M idLl lc Al(cN. From 1 his

111k11I rnnt 11111111 ion of the

ancient exegetical tradition. M.-D. Chenu3 has defined the specific character
of Scholastics as "dialectics applied to the comprehension 9f a text: either a
continuous text, in which case the goal is the writing of a commentary, or of
a series of texts, which are selected to serve as bases and proofs for a given
speculative construction."4 For this scholar, Scholastics is "a rational form of
thought which is consciously and deliberately elaborated, taking as its
starting-point a text considered as authoritative." 5 If we accent these definitions,
we can assert that Scholastic thought did nothing other than adopt
thought-processes already traditionally used in the majority of ancient philosophical
schools. Conversely, we could also say that these schools were already
engaging in Scholastic thought. Throughout the Middle Ages, instruction
consisted essentially in textual commentary, whether of the Bible, Aristotle,
Boethius, or the Sentences of Peter Lombard.
These facts have important consequences for the general interpretation of
the history of philosophy, especially during its pre-Cartesian period. Insofar
as philosophy was considered exegesis, the search for truth, throughout this
period, was confounded with the search for the meaning of "authentic" texts;
that is, of those texts considered as authoritative. Truth was contained within
these text.�; it was the property of their authors, as it was also the property of
those groups who recognized the authority of these authors, and who were
consequently the "heirs" of this original truth.
Philosophical problems were expressed in exegetical terms. For example, we
find Plotinus writing the following in the course of his investigation of the
problem of evil: "We must try to find out in what sense Plato says that evils shall
not pass away, and that their existence is necessary." 6 Typically, the rest of
Plotinus' inquiry consists in a discussion of the terminology used by Plato in his
Theaelelus.7 The famous battle over universals, which divided the Middle Ages,
was based on the exegesis of a single phrase from Porphyry's lsagoge. It would
be possible to make a list of all the texts which, upon being discussed, formed
the basis of all ancient and medieval problematics. The list would not be long: it
might contain a few passages from Plato (especially the Ti111aeus), Aristotle,
Boethius, the first chapter of Genesis, and the prologue to the Gospel of John.
The fact that authentic texts raise questions is not due to any inherent
defect. On the contrary: their obscurity, it was thought, was only the result
of a technique used by a master, who wished to hint at a great many things
at once, and therefore enclosed the "truth" in his formulations. Any potential
m�aning, as long as it was coherent with what was considered to be the
master's doctrine, was consequently held to be true. Charles Thurot's remark8
nbout the commentators on the grammarian Priscianus is applicable to all the
philosopher cxegctcs:
In their explanations of a text, the glossators did not seek to understand
t hl' 11uthur111 1 huul(lu ; hut r111 hcr to tc11ch l he doctrine itself which they
74 Method
supposed to be contained in it. What they termed an "authentic" author
could neither be mistaken, nor contradict himself, nor develop his
arguments poorly, nor disagree with any other authentic author. The
most forced exegesis was used in order to accommodate the letter of the
text to what was considered the truth.9
It was believed that the truth had been "given" in the master's texts, and that
all that had to be done was to bring it to light and explicate it. Plotinus, for
example, writes: "These statements arc not new; they do not belong to the
present time, but were made long ago, although not explicitly, and what we
have said in this discussion has been an interpretation of them, relying on
Plato's own writings for evidence that these views arc ancient." 10 Here we
encounter another aspect of the conception of truth implied by "exegetical"
philosophy. Each philosophical or religious school or group believed itself to
be in possession of a traditional truth, communicated from the beginning by
the divinity to a few wise men. Each therefore laid claim to being the
legitimate depositary of the truth.
From this perspective, the conflict between pagans and Christians, from the
second century AD on, is highly instructive. As both pagans and Christians
recognized affinities between their respective doctrines, they accused each
other of theft. Some claimed Plato plagiarized Moses, while others affirmed
the contrary; the result was a series of chronological arguments destined to
prove which of the two was historically prior. For Clement of Alexandria, the
theft dated back even before the creation of humanity. It had been some
wicked angel who, having discovered some traces of the divine truth, revealed
philosophy to the wise of this world. 1 1
Pagans and Christians explained in the same way the differences which,
despite certain analogies, persisted between their doctrines. They were the
result of misunderstandings and mistranslations - in other words, bad exegesis
- of stolen texts. For Celsus, the Christian conception of humility was nothing
but a poor interpretation of a passage in Plato's Laws; 12 the idea of the
kingdom of God only a misreading of a passage in Plato's text on the king of
all things, ll and the notion of the resurrection only a misunderstanding of the
idea of transmigration. On the Christian side, Justin asserted that some of
Plato's statements showed that he had misunderstood the text of Moses.1�
In this intellectual atmosphere, error was the result of bad exegesis,
m istranslation, and faulty understanding. Nowadays, however, historians
seem to consider all exegetical thought as the result of mistakes or misunderstandings.
We can briefly enumerate the forms these alleged mistakes and
deformations are thought to assume: in the first place, the excgctes make
arbitrary systematizations. For instance, they take out of context passages
originally widely separated from each other, nml n n11l yze t hl'rn in 11 pUl'ely
formal way, in order to reduce t he texts to hl' cxpl11inl'll to 11 hoi l \' 1 11' rnhl'rl'nt
Philosophy, Exegesis, and Crtalivt Mistakes 75
doctrine. In this way, for instance, a four- or five-tiered hierarchy of being
was extracted from various dialogues of Plato.
Nor is this the most serious abuse. Whether consciously or not, systematization
amalgamates the most disparate notions, which had originated in
different or even contradictory doctrines. Thus we find the commentators on
Aristotle using Stoic and Platonic ideas in their exegesis of Aristotelian texts.
It is fairly frequent, especially in the case of translated texts, to find
commentators trying to explain notions which simply do not exist in the
original. In Psalm 1 1 3: 1 6, for example, we read: "The heaven is the heaven
of the Lord." Augustine, however, started out from the Greek translation of
the Bible, and understood: "The heaven of heavens is of [i.e. belongs to] the
Lord." Augustine is thus led to imagine a cosmological reality, which he
identifies with the intelligible world, which he then goes on to try and locate
with relation to the "heaven" mentioned in the first verse of Genesis. From
the point of view of the actual text of the Bible, this whole construction is
based on thin air.
Cases of misunderstanding arc not always this extreme. Nevertheless, it
frequently occurs that exegeses construct entire edifices of interpretation on
the basis of a banal or misunderstood phrase. The whole of Neoplatonic
exegesis of the Parmenides seems to be an example of such a phenomenon.
The modern historian may be somewhat disconcerted on coming across
such modes of thought, so far removed from his usual manner of reasoning.
He is, however, forced to admit one fact: very often, mistakes and misunderstandings
have brought about important evolutions in the history of philosophy.
In particular, they have caused new ideas to appear. The most
interesting example of this seems to me to be the appearance of the distinction
between "being" as an infinitive and "being" as a participle, 15 which, as I have
shown elsewhere, 16 was thought up by Porphyry in order to solve a problem
posed by a passage in Plato. In the Parmenides, 17 Plato had asked: "If the One
is, is it possible that it should not participate in being [ousia]?" For the
Neoplatonist Porphyry, the One in question here is the second One. If this
second One participates in ousia, he reasons, we must assume that ousia is
prior to the second One. Now, the only thing prior to the second One is the
first One, and this latter is not in any sense ousia. Thus, Porphyry concludes
that, in this passage, the word ousia designates the first One in an enigmatic,
symbolical way. The first One is not ousia in the sense of "substance"; rather,
it \s being (elre) in the sense of a pure, transcendent act, prior to being as a
substantial object (etanl). L 'etant, then, is the first substance and the first
determination of l 'etre.
The history of the notion of being is, moreover, marked by a whole series
of such crea tive mistakes. If we consider the series formed by ousia in Plato,
,,,,,,;,, in Ari11tot le, rm.fill in the Stoics, rmsit1 in the Neoplatonists, and subs1at11ia
ur m1•111111 in the church F11thcrs 11nd t he Scholastics, we sha ll find that the
76 Method
idea of ousia or essence is amongst the most confused and confusing of
notions. I have tried to show elsewhere18 that the distinction, established by
Boethius, between esse and quod est19 did not originally have the meaning that
the Middle Ages was later to attribute to it.
It is clear that historians of philosophy must use the greatest caution in
applying the idea of "system" for the comprehension of the philosophical
works of antiquity and the Middle Ages. It is not the case that every properly
philosophical endeavor is "systematic" in the Kantian or Hegelian sense. For
two thousand years, philosophical thought utilized a methodology which
condemned it to accept incoherences and far-fetched associations, precisely to
the extent that it wanted to be systematic. But to study the actual progress of
exegetical thought is to begin to realize that thought can function rationally
in many different ways, which are not necessarily the same as those of
mathematical logic or Hegelian dialectic.
Philosophers of the modem era, from the seventeenth to the beginning of the
nineteenth centuries, refused the argument from authority and abandoned the
exegetical mode of thinking. They began to consider that the truth was not a
ready-made given, but was rather the result of a process of elaboration, carried
out by a reason grounded in itself. After an initial period of optimism, however,
in which people believed it was possible for thought to postulate itself in an
absolute way, philosophy began to become more and more aware, from the
nineteenth century on, of its historical and especially linguistic conditioning.
This was a legitimate reaction, but it could be that it<t result has been that
philosophers have let themselves be hypnotized by philosophical discourse
taken in and for itself. In the last analysis, philosophical discourse now tends
to have as its object nothing but more philosophical discourse. In a sense,
contemporary philosophical discourse has once again become exegetical, and,
sad to say, it often interprets its texts with the same violence used by ancient
practitioners of allegory.

interrupted in the first century BC, the successors of Plato nevertheless always
considered themselves heirs of an unbroken spiritual tradition.

Spiritual Exercises
To take flight every day! At least for a moment, which may be brief, as
long as it is intense. A "spiritual exercise" every day - either alone, or
in the company of someone who also wishes to better himself. Spiritual
exercises. Step out of duration ... try to get rid of your own passions,
vanities, and the itch for talk about your own name, which sometimes
burns you like a chronic disease. A void backbiting. Get rid of pity and
hatred. Love all free human beings. Become eternal by transcending
yourself.
This work on yourself is necessary; this ambition justified. Lots of people
let themselves be wholly absorbed by militant politics and the preparation
for social revolution. Rare, much more rare, are they who, in order to
prepare for the revolution, are willing to make themselves worthy of it.
With the exception of the last few lines, doesn't this text look like a pastiche
of Marcus Aurelius? It is by Georges Friedmann, 1 and it is quite possible that,
when he wrote it, the author was not aware of the resemblance. Moreover, in
the rest of his book, in which he seeks a place "to re-source himself '',2 he
comes to the conclusion that there is no tradition - be it Jewish, Christian, or
Oriental - compatible with contemporary spiritual demands. Curiously,
however, he does not ask himself about the value of the philosophical tradition
of Greco-Roman antiquity, although the lines we have just quoted show to
just what extent ancient tradition continues - albeit unconsciously - to live
within him, as it does within each of us.
".Spiritual exercises. " The expression is a bit d isconcerting for the contemporary
reader. In the first place, it is no longer quite fashionable these days
to use the word "spiritual." It is nevertheless necessary to use this term, I
believe, because none of the other adjectives we could use - "psychic,"
"moral," "ethical," "intellectual," "of thought," "of the soul'' - covers all the
1111r>cct11 of the rcnlity we want to describe. Since, in these exercises, it is
1 h11uirh1 which, llK ii were, rnkcK itself nK it11 own subject-matter,·1 and seeks to
82 Spiritual Exercises
modify itself, it would be possible for us to speak in terms of "thought
exercises." Yet the word "thought" does not indicate clearly enough that
imagination and sensibility play a very important role in these exercises. For
the same reason, we cannot be satisfied with "intellectual exercises," although
such intellectual factors as definition, division, ratiocination, reading, investigation,
and rhetorical amplification play a large role in them. "Ethical
exercises" is a rather tempting expression, since, as we shall see, the exercises
in question contribute in a powerful way to the therapeutics of the passions,
and have to do with the conduct of life. Yet, here again, this would be too
limited a view of things. As we can glimpse through Friedmann's text, these
exercises in fact correspond to a transformation of our vision of the world,
and to a metamorphosis of our personality. The word "spiritual" is quite apt
to make us understand that these exercises are the result, not merely of
thought, but of the individual's entire psychism. Above all, the word
"spiritual" reveals the true dimensions of these exercises. By means of them,
the individual raises himself up to the life of the objective Spirit; that is to
say, he re-places himself within the perspective of the Whole ("Become
eternal by transcending yourself").
Here our reader may say, "All right, we'll accept the expression 'spiritual
exercises'. But are we talking about Ignatius of Loyola's Exercitia spiritualia?4
What relationship is there between lgnatian meditations and Friedmann's
program of "stepping out of duration ... becoming eternal by transcending
oneself?" Our reply, quite simply, is that Ignatius' Exercilia spiritualia arc
nothing but a Christian version of a Greco-Roman tradition, the extent of which
we hope to demonstrate in what follows. In the first place, both the idea and the
terminology of e�:erdtium spirituale arc attested in early Latin Christianity, well
before Ignatius of Loyola, and they correspond to the Greek Christian term
askesis.5 In tum, askesis - which must be understood not as asceticism, but as the
practice of spiritual exercises - already existed within the philosophical tradition
of antiquity.6 In the final analysis, it is to antiquity that we must return in order
to explain the origin and significance of this idea of spiritual exercises, which, as
Friedmann's example shows, is still alive in contemporary consciousness.
The goal of the present chapter is not merely to draw attention to the
existence of spiritual exercises in Greco-Latin antiquity, but above all to
delimit the scope and importance of the phenomenon, and to show the
consequences which it entails for the understanding not only of ancient
thought, but of philosophy itself.7

that philosophy, for them, was an "exercise!' 8 In their view, philosophy did
not consist in teaching an abstract theory9 - much less in the e,xegesis of texts10
- but rather in the art of living. 11 It is a concrete attitude and determinate lifestyle,
which engages the whole of existence. The philosophical act is not
situated merely on the cognitive level, but on that of the self and of being. It
is a progress which causes us to be more fully, and makes us better. 12 It is a
conversion13 which turns our entire life upside down, changing the life of the
person who goes through it. 14 It raises the individual from an inauthentic
condition of life, darkened by unconsciousness and harassed by worry, to an
authentic state of life, in which he attains self-consciousness, an exact vision
of the world, inner peace, and freedom.
In the view of all philosophical schools, mankind's principal cause of
suffering, disorder, and unconsciousness were the passions: that is, unregulated
desires and exaggerated fears. People are prevented from truly living, it
was taught, because they are dominated by worries. Philosophy thus appears,
in the first place, as a therapeutic of the passions15 (in the words of
Friedmann: "Try to get rid of your own passions"). Each school had its own
therapeutic method, 16 but all of them linked their therapeutics to a profound
transformation of the individual's mode of seeing and being. The object of
spiritual exercises is precisely to bring about this transformation.
To begin with, let us consider the example of the Stoics. For them, all
mankind's woes derive from the fact that he seeks to acquire or to keep
possessions that he may either lose or fail to obtain, and from the fact that he
tries to avoid misfortunes which are often inevitable. The task of philosophy,
then, is to educate people, so that they seek only the goods they are able to
obtain, and try to avoid only those evils which it is possible to avoid. In order
for something good to be always obtainable, or an evil always avoidable, they
must depend exclusively on man's freedom; but the only things which fulfill
these conditions are moral good and evil. They alone depend on us;
everything else does not depend on us. Here, "everything else," which does
not depend on us, refers to the necessary linkage of cause and effect, which
is not subject to our freedom. It must be indifferent to us: that is, we must
not introduce any differences into it, but accept it in its entirety, as willed by
fate. This is the domain of nature.
We have here a complete reversal of our usual way of looking at things. We
are to switch from our "human•• vision of reality, in which our values depend
on
,
our passions, to a "natural" vision of things, which replaces each event
within the perspective of universal nature.17
Such a transformation of vision is not easy, and it is precisely here that
spiritual exercises come in. Little by little, they make possible the indispensable
metamorphosis of our inner self.
No 11ystcmatic treatise codifying the instructions and techniques for
Npiritu11l cxcrciNcN h11K come down to us. '" However, allusions to one or the
84 Spiritual Exercises
other of such inner activities are very frequent in the writings of the Roman
and Hellenistic periods. It thus appears that these exercises were well known,
and that it was enough to allude to them, since they were a part of daily life
in the philosophical schools. They took their place within a traditional course
of oral instruction.
Thanks to Philo of Alexandria, however, we do possess two lists of spiritual
exercises. They do not completely overlap, but they do have the merit of
giving us a fairly complete panorama of Stoico-Platonic inspired philosophical
therapeutics. One of these lists19 enumerates the following elements: research
(zetesis), thorough investigation (skepsis), reading (anagnosis), listening (akroasis),
attention (prosoche), self-mastery (enkrateia), and indifference to indifferent
things. The other20 names successively: reading, meditations (meleta1),
therapies21 of the passions, remembrance of good things,22 self-mastery
(enkrateia), and the accomplishment of duties. With the help of these lists, we
shall be able to give a brief description of Stoic spiritual exercises. We shall
study the following groups in succession: first attention, then meditations
and "remembrances of good things," then the more intellectual exercises:
reading, listening, research, and investigation, and finally the more active
exercises: self-mastery, accomplishment of duties, and indifference to indifferent
things.
Attention (prosoche) is the fundamental Stoic spiritual attitude.23 It is a
continuous vigilance and presence of mind, self consciousness which never
sleeps, and a constant tension of the spirit.2• Thanks to this attitude, the
philosopher is fully aware of what he does at each instant, and he wills his
actions fully. Thanks to his spiritual vigilance, the Stoic always has "at hand"
(procheiron) the fundamental rule of life: that is, the distinction between what
depends on us and what does not. As in Epicureanism, so for Stoicism: it is
essential that the adepts be supplied with a fundamental principle which is
formulable in a few words, and extremely clear and simple, precisely so that it
may remain easily accessible to the mind, and be applicable with the sureness
and constancy of a reflex. "You must not separate yourself from these general
principles; don't sleep, eat, drink, or converse with other men without them." 25
It is this vigilance of the spirit which lets us apply the fundamental rule to each
of life's particular situations, and always to do what we do "appropriately." 26
We could also define this attitude as "concentration on the present moment": n
Everywhere and at all times, it is up to you to rejoice piously at what is
occurring at the present moment, to conduct yourself with justice towards the
people who are present here and now, and to apply rul� of discernment to your
present representations, so that nothing slips in that is not objective.211
Attention to the present moment is, in a sense, the key to Hpiritunl e"crci11cs.
Ir frees us from the p11ssionH, which 11rc 11l wnys CllUKcd hy the l>RNI or the
Spiritual Exercises 85
future29 - two areas which do not depend on us. By encouraging concentration
on the minuscule present moment, which, in its exiguity, is always bearable
and controllable,30 attention increases our vigilance. Finally, ' attention to the
present moment allows us to accede to cosmic consciousness, by making us
attentive to the infinite value of each instant,31 and causing us to accept each
moment of existence from the viewpoint of the universal law of the cosmos.
Attention ( prosoche) allows us to respond immediately to events, as if they
were questions asked of us all of a sudden. 32 In order for this to be possible,
we must always have the fundamental principles "at hand" ( procheiron).33 We
are to steep ourselves in the rule of life (kanon),34 by mentally applying it to
all life's possible different situations, just as we assimilate a grammatical or
mathematical rule through practice, by applying it to individual cases. In this
case, however, we are not dealing with mere knowledge, but with the
transformation of our personality.
We must also associate our imagination and affectivity with the training of
our thought. Here, we must bring into play all the psychagogic techniques
and rhetorical methods of amplification.35 We must formulate the rule of life
to ourselves in the most striking and concrete way. We must keep life's events
"before our eyes," 36 and see them in the light of the fundamental rule. This
is known as the exercise of memorization (mneme)31 and meditation (me/ete)38
on the rule of life.
The exercise of meditation39 allows us to be ready at the moment when an
unexpected - and perhaps dramatic - circumstance occurs. In the exercise
called praemeditatio malorum,40 we are to represent to ourselves poverty,
suffering, and death. We must confront life's difficulties face to face,
remembering that they are not evils, since they do not depend on us. This is
why we must engrave striking maxims in our memory,41 so that, when the
time comes, they can help us accept such events, which are, after all, part of
the course of nature; we will thus have these maxims and sentences "at
hand."42 What we need are persuasive formulae or arguments (epilogismoi),4l
which we can repeat to ourselves in difficult circumstances, so as to check
movements of fear, anger, or sadness.
First thing in the morning, we should go over in advance what we have to
do during the course of the day, and decide on the principles which will guide
and inspire our actions.44 In the evening, we should examine ourselves again,
so as to be aware of the faults we have committed or the progress we have
made . 45 We should also examine our dreams.46
As we can see, the exercise of meditation is an attempt to control inner
discourse, in an effort to render it coherent. The goal is to arrange it around
o simple, universal principle: the distinction between what does and does not
depend on us, or between freedom and nature. Whoever wishes to make

at a complete transformation of his representation of the world, his inner
climate, and his outer behavior. These methods testify to a deep knowledge
of the therapeutic powers of the world. s
i
The exercise of meditation and memorization requires nourishment. This
is where the more specifically intellectual exercises, as enumerated by Philo,
come in: reading, listening, research, and investigation. It is a relatively simple
matter to provide food for meditation: one could read the sayings of the poets
and philosophers, for instance, or the apoph1hegmata.s2 "Reading," however,
could also include the explanation of specifically philosophical texts, works
written by teachers in philosophical schools. Such texts could be read or heard
within the framework of the philosophical instruction given by a professor.s3
Fortified by such instruction, the disciple would be able to study with
precision the entire speculative edifice which sustained and justified the
fundamental rule, as well as all the physical and logical research of which this
rule was the summary.s4 "Research" and "investigation" were the result of
putting instruction into practice. For example, we are to get used to defining
objects and events from a physical point of view, that is, we must picture
them as they are when situated within the cosmic Whole.ss Alternatively, we
can divide or dissect events in order to recognize the elements into which
they can be reduced.56
Finally, we come to the practical exercises, intended to create habits. Some
of these are very much "interior," and very close to the thought exercises we
have just discussed. "Indifference to indifferent things," for example, was
nothing other than the application of the fundamental rule. s7 Other exercises,
such as self-mastery and fulfilling the duties of social life, entailed practical
forms of behavior. Here again, we encounter Friedmann's themes: "Try to get
rid of your own passions, vanities, and the itch for talk about your own name
... Avoid backbiting. Get rid of pity and hatred. Love all free human beings."
There are a large number of treatises relating to these exercises in Plutarch:
On Restraining Anger, On Peace of Mind, On Brotherly Love, On the Love of
Children, On Garruli{y, On the Love of Wealth, On False Shame, On Envy and
Haired. Seneca also composed works of the same genre: On Anger, On
Benefits, On Peace of Mind, On Leisure . In this kind of exercise, one very
simple principle is always recommended: begin practicing on easier things, so
as gradually to acquire a stable, solid habit. 58
For the Stoic, then, doing philosophy meant practicing how to "live": that
is, how to live freely and consciously. Consciously, in that we pass beyond the
limits of individuality, to recognize ourselves as a part of the reason-animated
cosmos. Freely, in that we give up desiring that which does not depend on us
and is beyond our control, so as to attach ourselves only to what depends on
us: actions which are just and in conformity with reason.
It is easy to understand that a philosophy like Stoicism, which re<1uircs

exercises. But it will perhaps come as a surprise to learn than Epicureanism,
usually considered the philosophy of pleasure, gives just as pr
,
ominent a place
as Stoicism to precise practices which are nothing other than spiritual
exercises. The reason for this is that, for Epicurus just as much as for the
Stoics, philosophy is a therapeutics: "We must concern ourselves with the
healing of our own lives." 59 In this context, healing consists in bringing one's
soul back from the worries of life to the simple joy of existing. People's
unhappiness, for the Epicureans, comes from the fact that they are afraid of
things which are not to be feared, and desire things which it is not necessary
to desire, and which are beyond their control. Consequently, their life is
consumed in worries over unjustified fears and unsatisfied desires. As a result,
they are deprived of the only genuine plea.i;ure there is: the pleasure of
existing. This is why Epicurean physics can liberate us from fear: it can show
us that the gods have no effect on the progress of the world and that death,
being complete dissolution, is not a part of life.60 Epicurean ethics: Epicurean,
as deliverance from desires can deliver us from our insatiable desires, by
distinguishing between desires which are both natural and necessary, desires
which are natural but not necessary, and desires which are neither natural nor
necessary. It is enough to satisfy the first category of desires, and give up the
last - and eventually the second as well - in order to ensure the absence of
worries,61 and to reveal the sheer joy of existing: "The cries of the flesh are:
'Not to be hungry', 'not to be thirsty', 'not to be cold'. For if one enjoys the
possession of this, and the hope of continuing to possess it, he might rival
even Zeus in happiness." 62 This is the source of the feeling of gratitude,
which one would hardly have expected, which illuminates what one might call
Epicurean piety towards all things: "Thanks be to blessed Nature, that she
has made what is necessary easy to obtain, and what is not easy unnecessary."
6J
Spiritual exercises are required for the healing of the soul. Like the Stoics,
the Epicureans advise us to meditate upon and assimilate, "day and night,"
brief aphorisms or summaries which will allow us to keep the fundamental
dogmas "at hand." 64 .For instance, there is the well-known tetrapharmakos, or
four-fold healing formula: "God presents no fears, death no worries. And
while good is readily attainable, evil is readily endurable." 65 The abundance
of collections of Epicurean aphorisms is a response to the demands of the
spiritual exercise of meditation.66 As with the Stoics, however, the study of
the dogmatic treatises of the school's great founders was also an exercise
intended to provide material for meditation,67 so as more thoroughly to
impregnate the soul with the fundamental intuitions of Epicureanism.
The study of physics is a particularly important spiritual exercise: "we
i;hould not think that any other end is served by knowledge of celestial
l'henomena ... t hnn freedom from disturbance and firm confidence, just as
in 1 hc other licldN of Nludy . " "" Cont emplation of the physical world and
88 Spiritual Exercises
imagination of the infinite are important elements of Epicurean physics. Both
can bring about a complete change in our way of looking at things. The closed
universe is infinitely dilated, and we derive from this spectacle a unique
spiritual pleasure:
the walls of the world open out, I see action going on throughout the
whole void, ... Thereupon from all these things a sort of divine delight
gets hold upon me and a shuddering, because nature thus by your power
(i.e. Epicurus') has been so manifestly laid open and unveiled in every
part.69
Meditation, however, be it simple or erudite, is not the only Epicurean
spiritual exercise. To cure the soul, it is not necessary, as the Stoics would
have it, to train it to stretch itself tight, but rather to train it to relax. Instead
of picturing misfortunes in advance, so as to be prepared to bear them, we
must rather, say the Epicureans, detach our thought from the vision of painful
things, and fix our eyes on pleasurable ones. We arc to relive memories of
past pleasures, and enjoy the pleasures of the present, recognizing how intense
and agreeable these present pleasures are.70 We have here a quite distinctive
spiritual exercise, different from the constant vigilance of the Stoic, with his
constant readiness to safeguard his moral liberty at each instant. Instead,
Epicureanism preaches the deliberate, continually renewed choice of relaxation
and serenity, combined with a profound gratitude71 toward nature and
life,72 which constantly offer us joy and pleasure, if only we know how to find
them.
By the same token, the spiritual exercise of trying to live in the present
moment is very different for Stoics and Epicureans. For the former, it means
mental tension and constant wakefulness of the moral conscience; for the
latter, it is, as we have seen, an invitation to relaxation and serenity. Worry,
which tears us in the direction of the future, hides from us the incomparable
value of the simple fact of existing: "We are born once, and cannot be born
twice, but for all time must be no more. But you, who are not master of
tomorrow, postpone your happiness: life is wasted in procrastination and each
one of us dies overwhelmed with cares." 7J This is the doctrine contained in
Horace's famous saying: carpe diem.
Life ebbs as I speak:
so seize each day, and grant the next no credit.74
For the Epicureans, in the last analysis, pleasure is a spiritual exercise. Not
pleasure in the form of mere sensual gratification, but the intellectual 1>le11surc
derived from contemplating nature, the thought of pleasurc11 past nnd prc11cnt,
and lastly the pleasure of fricnd11hip. In Epicurc1m conununit ic11, fritmd11hi1111
Spiritual Exercises 89
also had its spiritual exercises, carried out in a joyous, relaxed atmosphere.
These include the public confession of one's faults;76 m)itual correction,
carried out in a fraternal spirit; and examining one's conscience.n Above all,
friendship itself was, as it were, the spiritual exercise par excellence: "Each
person was to tend towards creating the atmosphere in which hearts could
flourish. The main goal was to be happy, and mutual affection and the
confidence with which they relied upon each other contributed more than
anything else to this happiness." 78
2 Learning to Dialogue
The practice of spiritual exercises is likely to be rooted in traditions going
back to immemorial timcs.79 It is, however, the figure of Socrates that causes
them to emerge into Western consciousness, for this figure was, and has
remained, the living cal l to awaken our moral consciousness.80 We ought not
to forget that this call sounded forth within a specific form: that of dialogue.
In the "Socratic" HI dialogue, the question truly at stake is not what is being
talked about, but who is doing the talking.
anyone who is close to Socrates and enters into conversation with him
is liable to be drawn into an argument, and whatever subject he may
start, he will be continually carried round and round by him, until at
last he finds that he has to give an account both of his present and past
life, and when he is once entangled, Socrates will not let him go until
he has completely and thoroughly sifted him ... And I think there is no
harm in being reminded of any wrong thing which we are, or have been,
doing; he who does not run away from criticism will be sure to take
more heed of his afterlife.82
In a "Socratic" dialogue, Socrates' interlocutor docs not learn anything, and
Socrates has no intention of teaching him anything. He repeats, moreover, to
all who are willing to listen, that the only thing he knows is that he docs not
know anything.HJ Y ct, l ike an indefatigable horsefly,IH Socrates harassed his
interlocutors with questions which put themselves into question, forcing them
to pay attention to and take care of themselves.85
My very good friend, you are an Athenian, and belong to a city which
is the greatest and most famous in the world for its wisdom and
Nlrcngth. Arc you not ashamed that you give your attention to acquiring

90 Spiritual Exercises
Socrates' mission consisted in inviting his contemporaries to examine their
conscience, and to take care for their inner progress:
I did not care for the things that most people care about - making
money, having a comfortable home, high military or civil rank, and all
the other activities, political appointments, secret societies, party organizations,
which go on in our city ... I set myself to do you - each one
of you, individually and in private - what I hold to be the greatest
possible service. I tried to persuade each one of you to concern himself
less with what lie has than with what he is, so as to render himself as
excellent and as rational as possible.87
In Plato's Symposium, Alcibiades describes the effect made on him by
dialogues with Socrates in the following terms: "this latter-day Marsyas, here,
has often left me in such a state of mind that I've felt I simply couldn't go
on living the way I did ... He makes me admit that while I'm spending my
time on politics, I am neglecting all the things that are crying for attention in
myself." 8
8
Thus, the Socratic dialogue turns out to be a kind of communal spiritual
exercise. In it, the interlocutors are invited89 to participate in such inner
spiritual exercises as examination of conscience and attention to oneself; in
other words, they are urged to comply with the famous dictum, "Know
thyself." Although it is difficult to be sure of the original meaning of this
formula, this much is clear: it invites us to establish a relationship of the self
to the self, which constitutes the foundation of every spiritual exercise. To
know oneself means, among other things, to know oneself qua non-sage: that
is, not as a sophos, but as a philo-sophos, someone on the way toward wisdom.
Alternatively, it can mean to know oneself in one's essential being; this entails
separating that which we are not from that which we are. Finally, it can mean
to know oneself in one's true moral state: that is, to examine one's conscience.90

If we can trust the portrait sketched by Plato and Aristophanes, Socrates,
master of dialogue with others, was also a master of dialogue with himself,
and, therefore, a master of the practice of spiritual exercises. He is portrayed
as capable of extraordinary mental concentration. He arrives late at Agathon's
banquet, for example, because "as we went along the road, Socrates directed
his intellect towards himself, and began to fall behind." 91 Alcibiades tells the
story of how, during the expedition against Poteidaia, Socrates remained
standing all day and all night, "lost in thought." 92 In his Cloutls, Aristophanes

Meditation - the practice of dialogue with oneself - seems to have held a
place of honor among Socrates' disciples. When Antisthenes was asked what
profit he had derived from philosophy, he replied: "The ability to converse
with myself." 94 The intimate connection between dialogue with others and
dialogue with oneself is profoundly significant. Only he who is capable of a
genuine encounter with the other is capable of an authentic encounter with
himself, and the converse is equally true. Dialogue can be genuine only within
the framework of presence to others and to oneself. From this perspective,
every spiritual exercise is a dialogue, insofar as it is an exercise of authentic
presence, to oneself and to others.95
The borderline between "Socratic" and "Platonic" dialogue is impossible
to delimit. Yet the Platonic dialogue is always "Socratic" in inspiration,
because it is an intellectual, and, in the last analysis, a
"spiritual" exercise. This characteristic of the Platonic dialogue needs to be
emphasized.
Platonic dialogues are model exercises. They are models, in that they are
not transcriptions of real dialogues, but literary compositions which present
an ideal dialogue. And they are exercises precisely insofar as they are
dialogues: we have already seen, apropos of Socrates, the dialectical character
of all spiritual exercises. A dialogue is an itinerary of the thought, whose route
is traced by the constantly maintained accord between questioner and
respondent. In opposing his method to that of eristics, Plato strongly
emphasizes this point:
When two friends, like you and I, feel like talking, we have to go about
it in a gentler and more dialectical way. "More dialectical," it seems to
me, means that we must not merely give true responses, but that we
must base our replies only on that which our interlocutor admits that
he himself knows.96
The dimension of the interlocutor is, as we can sec, of capital importance. It
is what prevents the dialogue from becoming a theoretical, dogmatic expose,
and forces it to be a concrete, practical exercise. For the point is not to set
fm:th a doctrine, but rather to guide the interlocutor towards a determinate
mental attitude. It is a combat, amicable but real.
The point is worth stressing, for the same thing happens in every spiritual
exercise: we must let ourselves be changed, in our point of view, attitudes,
11n<l con victions. This means that we must dialogue with ourselves, and hence
wr tnllHI du baulc with ourselves. This is why, from this perspective, the
mcthmlnlniry of t he Pliuonk di11lol(Ul' is of Much crucial interest:
92 Spiritual Exercises
Despite what may have been said, Platonic thought bears no resemblance
to a light-winged dove, who needs no effort to take off from earth
to soar away into the pure spaces of utopia ... at every moment, the
dove has to fight against the soul of the interlocutor, which is filled with
lead. Each degree of elevation must be fought for and won.97
To emerge victorious from this battle, it is not enough to disclose the truth.
It is not even enough to demonstrate it. What is needed is persuasion, and for
that one must use psychagogy, the art of seducing souls. Even at that, it is
not enough to use only rhetoric, which, as it were, tries to persuade from a
distance, by means of a continuous discourse. What is needed above all is
dialectic, which demands the explicit consent of the interlocutor at every
moment. Dialectic must skillfully choose a tortuous path - or rather, a series
of apparently divergent, but nevertheless convergent, paths98 - in order to
bring the interlocutor to discover the contradictions of his own position, or
to admit an unforeseen conclusion. All the circles, detours, endless divisions,
digressions, and subtleties which make the modern reader of Plato's Dialogues
so uncomfortable arc destined to make ancient readers and interlocutors travel
a specific path. Thanks to these detours, "with a great deal of effort, one rubs
names, definitions, visions and sensations against one another"; one
"spends a long time in the company of these questions"; one "lives with
them" 'l'I until the light blazes forth. Yet one keeps on practicing, since "for
reasonable people, the measure of listening to such discussions is the whole
of life." 100
What counts is not the solution of a particular problem, but the road
travelled to reach it; a road along which the interlocutor, the disciple, and the
reader form their thought, and make it more apt to discover the truth by
itself: IOI
Stranger: Suppose someone asked us this question about our class of
elementary school-children learning to read. "When a child is asked
what letters spell a word - it can be any word you please - are we to
regard this exercise as undertaken to discover the correct spelling of the
particular word the teacher assigned, or as designed rather to make the
child better able to deal with all words he may be asked to spell?"
Young Socrates: Surely we reply that the purpose is to teach him to
read them all.
Stranger: How docs this principle apply to our present search for the
statesman? Why did we set ourselves the problem? Is our chief purpose
to find the statesman, or have we the larger aim of becoming beucr
dialecticians, more able to tackle all questions?

Spiritual Exercises 93
As we see, the subject-matter of the dialogue counts less than the method
applied in it, and the solution of a problem has less value than the road
travelled in common in order to resolve it. The point is not to find the answer
to a problem before anyone else, but to practice, as effectively as possible, the
application of a method:
ease and speed in reaching the answer to the problem propounded are
most commendable, but the logos requires that this be only a secondary,
not a primary reason for commending an argument. What we must
value first and foremost, above all else, is the philosophical method
itself, and this consists in ability to divide according to forms. If,
therefore, either a lengthy logos or an unusually brief one leaves the
hearer more able to find the forms, it is this presentation of the logos
which must be diligently carried through. 103
As a dialectical exercise, the Platonic dialogue corresponds exactly to a
spiritual exercise. There are two reasons for this. In the first place, discreetly
but genuinely, the dialogue guides the interlocutor - and the reader - towards
conversion. Dialogue is only possible if the interlocutor has a real desire to
dialogue: that is, if he truly wants to discover the truth, desires the Good from
the depths of his soul, and agrees to submit to the rational demands of the
Logos. u>1 His act of faith must correspond to that of Socrates: "It is because
I am convinced of its truth that I am ready, with your help, to inquire into
the nature of virtue. " IO>
In fact, the dialectical effort is an ascent in common towards the truth and
towards the Good, "which every soul pursues."10t• Furthermore, in Plato's
view, every dialectical exercise, precisely because it is an exercise of pure
thought, subject to the demands of the Logos, turns the soul away from the
sensible world, and allows it to convert itself towards the Good. 107 It is the
spirit's itinerary towards the divine.
3 Learning to Die
There is a mysterious connection between language and death. This was
one of the favorite themes of the late Brice Parain, who wrote:
"l .. anguagc develops only upon the death of individuals. "H>R For the
Logos represents a demand for universal rationality, and presupposes a
world of immutable norms, which are opposed to the perpetual state of
becoming and changing appetites characteristic of individual, corporeal
lifo. In this opposition, he who remains faithful to the Logos risks losing his
life. This w1111 the c1111" with Socrates , who died for his faithfulness to the
I .Ol(flN.
94 Spiritual Exercises
Socrates' death was the radical event which founded Platonism. After
all, the essence of Platonism consists in the affirmation that the Good
is the ultimate cause of all beings. In the words of a fourth-century Neoplatonist:

If all beings are beings only by virtue of goodness, and if they participate
in the Good, then the first must necessarily be a good which transcends
being. Here is an eminent proof of this: souls of value despise being for
the sake of the Good, whenever they voluntarily place themselves in
danger, for their country, their loved ones, or for virtue.109
Socrates exposed himself to death for the sake of virtue. He preferred to die
rather than renounce the demands of his conscience, 1 10 thus preferring the
Good above being, and thought and conscience above the life of his body.
This is nothing other than the fundamental philosophical choice. If it is true
that philosophy subjugates the body's will to live to the higher demands of
thought, it can rightly be said that philosophy is the training and apprenticeship
for death. As Socrates puts it in the Phaedo: "it is a fact, Simmias, that
those who go about philosophizing correctly are in training for death, and that
to them of all men death is least alarming." 111
The death in question here is the spiritual separation of the soul and the
body:
separating the soul as much as possible from the body, and accustoming
it to gather itself together from every part of the body and concentrate
itself until it is completely independent, and to have its dwelling, so far
as it can, both now and in the future, alone and by itself, freed from the
shackles of the body .
1 12
Such is the Platonic spiritual exercise. But we must be wary of misinterpreting
it. In particular, we must not isolate it from the philosophical death of
Socrates, whose presence dominates the whole of the Phaedo. The separation
between soul and body under discussion here - whatever its prehistory - bears
absolutely no resemblance to any state of trance or catalepsy. In the latter, the
body loses consciousness, while the soul is in a supernatural visionary state. 1 13
All the arguments in the Phaedo, both preceding and following the passage
we have quoted above, show that the goal of this philosophical separation is
for the soul to liberate itself, shedding the passions linked to the corporeal
senses, so as to attain to the autonomy of thought. 1 14
We can perhaps get a better idea of this spiritual exercise if we understand
it as an attempt to liberate ourselves from a partial, pasi;ionnte point of view -
linked to the senses and the body - so as to rise tu 1hc univcrN11I, 11or11111tivc

the norm of the Good. Training for death is trammg to die to one's
individuality and passions, in order to look at things from t\le perspective of
universality and objectivity. ·
Such an exercise requires the concentration of thought upon itself, by
means of meditation and an inner dialogue. Plato alludes to this process in
the Republic, once again in the context of the tyranny of individual passions.
The tyranny of desire, he tells us, shows itself particularly clearly in dreams:
The savage part of the soul ... does not hesitate, in thought, to try to
have sex with its mother, or with anyone else, man, god, or animal. It
is ready to commit any bloody crime; there is no food it would not eat;
and, in a word, it does not stop short of any madness or shamclessness.
1 15
To liberate ourselves from this tyranny, we are to have recourse to a spiritual
exercise of the same type as that described in the Phaedo:
When, however, a man does not go to sleep before he has awakened his
rational faculty, and regaled it with excellent discourses and investigations,
concentrating himself on himself, having also appeased the
appetitive part ... and calmed the irascible part ... once he has calmed
these two parts of the soul, and stimulated the third, in which reason
resides ... it is then that the soul best attains to truth. 116
Here we shall ask the reader's indulgence to embark on a brief digression.
To present philosophy as "training for death" was a decision of paramount
importance. As Socrates' interlocutor in the Phaedo was quick to remark, such
a characterization seems somewhat laughable, and the common man would be
right in calling philosophers moribund mopers who, if they are put to death,
will have earned their punishment well. 1 17 For anyone who ta.kes philosophy
seriously, however, this Platonic dictum is profoundly true. It has had an
enormous influence on Western philosophy, and has been taken up even by
such adversaries of Platonism as Epicurus and Heidegger. Compared to this
formulation, the philosophical verbiage both of the past and of the present
seems empty indeed. In the words of La Rochefoucauld, "Neither the sun nor
death can be looked at directly." 1 18
,Indeed, the only ones even to auempl to do so are philosophers. Beneath
all their diverse conceptions of death, one common virtue recurs again and
again: lucidity. For Plato, he who has already tasted of the immortality of
thought cannot he frightened by the idea of being snatched away from
Nensible l ife. For the Epicurean, the thought of death is the same as the
conNcimumcHN of t he finite muurc of cxiHtence, and it is this which gives an
infinite v11luc lo c11t�h inNtnnt. l.•:nch of lifi:'N momcn111 surges forth laden with

incommensurable value: "Believe that each day that has dawned will be your
last; then you will receive each unexpected hour with gratitude." 1 19
In the apprenticeship of death, the Stoic discovers the apprenticeship of
freedom. Montaigne, in one of his best-known essays, That Philosophizing is
Learning how to Die, plagiarizes Seneca: "He who has learned how to die, has
un-learned how to serve." 120 The thought of death transforms the the tone
and level of inner life: "Keep death before your eyes every day ... and then
you will never have any abject thought nor any excessive desire." m This
philosophical theme, in turn, is connected with that of the infinite value of
the present moment, which we must live as if it were, simultaneously, both
the first moment and the last. 122
Philosophy is still "a training for dt.-ath" for a modern thinker such ao;
Heidegger. For him, the authenticity of existence consists in the lucid
anticipation of death, and it is up to each of us to choose between lucidity
and diversion. 123
For Plato, training for death is a spiritual exercise which consists in
changing one's point of view. We are to change from a vision of things
dominated by individual passions to a representation of the world governed
by the universality and objectivity of thought. This constitutes a conversion
(metastrophe) brought about with the totality of the soul. 124 From the
perspective of pure thought, things which are "human, all too human" seem
awfully puny. This is one of the fundamental themes of Platonic spiritual
exercises, and it is this which will allow us to maintain serenity in misfortunes:
The rational law declares that it is best to keep quiet as far as possible
in misfortune, and not to complain, because we cannot know what is
really good and evil in such things, and it does us no good for the future
to take them hard, and nothing in human life is worthy of great concern,
and our grieving is an obstacle to the very thing we need to come to our
aid as quickly as possible in such cases.
What do you mean?
To deliberate, I said, about what has happened to us, and, as in
dice-games, to re-establish our position according to whatever numbers
turn up, however reason indicates would be best, and ... always
accustom the soul to come as quickly as possible to cure the ailing part
and raise up what has fallen, making lamentations disappear by means
of its therapy. 12
5
One could say that this spiritual exercise is already Stoic, 1
26 since in it we can
see the utilization of maxims and principles intended to "accustom the soul,"
and liberate it from the passions. Among these maxims, the one affirming the
unimportance of human affairs plays an important role. Yet , in i111 turn, 1hi11
maxim is only the consequence of the movement dt•11crihcd in t he l'l1twln,
Spirilual E.wrcises 97
whereby the soul, moving from individuality to universality, rises to the level
of pure thought. /
The three key concepts of the insignificance of human affairs, contempt for
death, and the universal vision characteristic of pure thought are quite plainly
linked in the following passage:
there is this further point to be considered in distinguishing the
philosophical from the unphilosophical nature ... the soul must not
contain any hint of servility. For nothing can be more contrary than
such pettiness to the quality of a soul which must constantly strive to
embrace the universal totality of things divine and human ... But that
soul to which pertain grandeur of thought and the conlemplation of the
totality of time and of being, do you think that it can consider human
life to be a matter of great importance? Hence such a man will not
suppose death to be terrible. 127
Here, "training for death" is linked to the contemplation of the Whole and
elevation of thought, which rises from individual, passionate subjectivity to
the universal perspective. In other words, it attains to the exercise of pure
thought. In this passage, for the first time, this characteristic of the
philosopher receives the appellation it will maintain throughout ancient
tradition: greatness of soul. 128 Greatness of soul is the fruit of the universality
of thought. Thus, the whole of the philosopher's speculative and contemplative
effort becomes a spiritual exercise, insofar as he raises his thought up to
the perspective of the Whole, and liberates it from the illusions of individuality
(in the words of Friedmann: "Step out of duration ... become
eternal by transcending yourself").
From such a perspective, even physics becomes a spiritual exercise, which
is situated on three levels. In the first place, physics can be a contemplative
activity, which has its end in itself, providing joy and serenity to the soul, and
liberating it from day-to-day worries. This is the spirit of Aristotelian physics:
"nature, which fashioned creatures, gives amazing pleasure in their study to
all who can trace links of causation, and are naturally philosophers. "129 As we
have seen, it was in the contemplation of nature that the Epicurean Lucretius
found "a divine delight." 13° For the Stoic Epictetus, the meaning of our
existence resides in this contemplation: we have been placed on earth in order
to,contemplate divine creation, and we must not die before we have witnessed
its marvels and lived in harmony with nature.131
Clearly, the precise meaning of the contemplation of nature varies widely
from one philosophy to another. There is a great deal of difference between
A ristotelian physics, for example, and the feeling for nature as we find it in
Philo of Alex11ndrin nnd Plutnrch. It is nevertheless interesting to note with
wh11t t.•11th11NinN1t1 these t wo 11uthors 1tpe11k nbout their imap;inative physics:
98 Spiritual Exercises
Those who practice wisdom ... are excellent contemplators of nature
and everything she contains. They examine the earth, the sea, the sky,
the heavens, and all their inhabitants; they are joined in thought to the
sun, the moon, and all the other stars, both fixed and wandering, in their
courses; and although they are attached to the earth by their bodies, they
provide their souls with wings, so that they may walk on the ether and
contemplate the powers that live there, as is fitting for true citizens of the
world . . . and so, filled with excellence, accustomed to take no notice of
ills of the body or of exterior things ... it goes without saying that such
men, rejoicing in their virtues, make of their whole lives a festivat. •n
These last lines are an allusion to an aphorism of Diogenes the Cynic, which
is also quoted by Plutarch: "Does not a good man consider every day a
festival?" "And a very splendid one, to be sure," continues Plutarch,
if we are virtuous. For the world is the most sacred and divine of
temples, and the one most fitting for the gods. Man is introduced into
it by birth to be a spectator: not of artificial, immobile statues, but of
the perceptible images of intelligible essences ... such as the sun, the
moon, the stars, the rivers whose water always flows afresh, and the
earth, which sends forth food for plants and animals alike. A life which
is a perfect revelation, and an initiation into these mysteries, should be
filled with tranquillity and joy . 133
Physics as a spiritual exercise can also take on the form of an imaginative
"overflight,'' which causes human affairs to be regarded as of little importance.134
We encounter this theme in Marcus Aurelius:
Suppose you found yourself all of a sudden raised up to the heavens,
and that you were to look down upon h uman affairs in all their motley
diversity. You would hold them in contempt if you were to see, in the
same glance, how great is the number of beings of the ether and the air,
living round about you. 135
The same theme occurs in Seneca:
The soul has attained the culmination of happiness when, having
crushed underfoot all that is evil, it takes flight and penetrates the inner
recesses of nature. It is then, while wandering amongst the very stars,
that it l ikes to laugh at the costly pavements of the rich ... But the soul
cannot despise [all these riches] before it has been all around the world,
and casting a contemptuous glance at the nnrrow globe of the earth from
above, snys to itself: "So thiN i11 the pin-1min1 which 111 1 n11111 y n111 iun11
Spiritual Exercises
divide among themselves with fire and sword? How ridiculous are the
boundaries of men!"1l6
99
In this spiritual exercise of the vision of totality, and elevation of thought
to the level of universal thought, we can distinguish a third degree, in which
we come closer to the Platonic theme from which we started out. In the words
of Marcus Aurelius:
Don't limit yourself to breathing along with the air that surrounds you;
from now on, think along with the Thought which embraces all things.
For the intellective power is no less universally diffused, and does not
penetrate any the less into each being capable of receiving it, than the
air in the case of one capable of breathing it . .. you will make a large
room at once for yourself by embracing in your thought the whole
Universe, and grasping ever-continuing Time. 137
At this stage, it is as though we die to our individuality; in so doing, we
accede, on the one hand, to the interiority of our consciousness, and on the
other, to the universality of thought of the All.
You were already the All, but because something else besides the
All came to be added on to you, you have become less than the All, by
the very fact of this addition. For the addition did not come about
from being - what could be added to the All? - but rather from
not-being. When one becomes "someone" out of not-being, one is no
longer the All, until one leaves the not-being behind. Moreover, you
increase yourself when you reject everything other than the All, and
when you have rejected it, the All will be present to you ... The All
had no need to come in order to be present. If it is not present, the reason
is that it is you who have distanced yourself from it. "Distancing
yourself" does not mean leaving it to go someplace else - for it would
be there, too. Rather, it means turning away from the All, despite the
fact that it is there. 1Js
With Plotinus, we now return to Platonism. The Platonic tradition remained
faithful to Plato's spiritual exercises. We need only add that, in Neoplatonism,
th.e idea of spiritual progress plays a much more explicit role than in Plato's
writings. In Neoplatonism, the stages of spiritual progress corresponded to
different degrees of virtue. The hierarchy of these stages is described in many
Neoplatonic texts, 1 .111 serving in particular as the framework for Marinus' Life
1fl'mdus.1�11 Porphyry, editor of Plotinus' Enneads, systematically arranged his
m11ster'M work according to the stages of this spiritual progress. First, the soul
WllK puri fied hy i111 1(1'11clu11I dct nchmcnt from t he body; then came the
100 Spiritual Exercises
knowledge of, and subsequent passing beyond, the sensible world; finally, the
soul achieved conversion toward the Intellect and the One. HI
Spiritual exercises are a prerequisite for spiritual progress. In his treatise
On Abstinence from Animate Beings, Porphyry sums up the Platonic tradition
quite well. We must, he tells us, undertake two exercises (meletai): in the first
place, we must tum our thought away from all that is mortal and material.
Secondly, we must return toward the activity of the Intellect. m The first stage
of these Neoplatonic exercises includes aspects which are highly ascetic, in the
modem sense of the word: a vegetarian diet, among other things. In the same
context, Porphyry insists strongly on the importance of spiritual exercises.
The contemplation (theoria) which brings happiness, he tells us, does not
consist in the accumulation of discourse and abstract teachings, even if their
subject is true Being. Rather, we must make sure our studies are accompanied
by an effort to make these teachings become "nature and life" within us. 141
In the philosophy of Plotinus, spiritual exercises are of fundamental
importance. Perhaps the best example can be found in the way Plotinus
defines the essence of the soul and its immateriality. If we have doubts about
the immortality and immateriality of the soul, says Plotinus, this is because
we are accustomed to see it filled with irrational desires and violent sentiments
and passions.
If one wants to know the nature of a thing, one must examine it in its
pure state, since every addition to a thing is an obstacle to the knowledge
of that thing. When you examine it, then, remove from it everything
that is not itself; better still remove all your stains from yourself and
el·amine yourse/j; and you will have faith in your immortality. 144
If you do not yet see your own beauty, do as the sculptor does with a
statue which must become beautiful: he removes one part, scrapes
another, makes one area smooth, and cleans the other, until he causes
the beautiful face in the statue to appear. In the same way, you too must
remove everything that is superfluous, straighten that which is crooked,
and purify all that is dark until you make it brilliant. Never stop
sculpting your own statue, until the divine splendor of virtue shines in
you ... If you have become this ... and have nothing alien inside you
mixed with yourself ... when you see that you have become this ...
concentrate your gaze and see. For it is only an eye such as this that can
look on the great Beauty.HS
Here we can see how the the demonstration of the soul's immaterial ity has
been transformed into experience. Only he who liberates h imsel f 1md purifies
himself from the passions , which conceal the true reality of the 11oul, can
understand that the soul i1t immn1eriul nnd immortal. Hrm\ knowledge Is u

spiritual exercise. 146 We must first undergo moral purification, in order to
become capable of understanding.
When the object of our knowledge is no longer the soul, but the Intellect147
and above all the One, principle of all things, we must once again have
recourse to spiritual exercises. In the case of the One, Plotinus makes a clear
distinction between, on the one hand, "instruction," which speaks about its
object in an exterior way, and, on the other, the "path," which truly leads to
concrete knowledge of the Good: "We are instructed about it by analogies,
negations, and the knowledge of things which come from it ... we are led
towards it by purifications, virtues, inner settings in order, and ascents into
the intelligible world." 148 Plotinus' writings are full of passages describing
such spiritual exercises, the goal of which was not merely to know the Good,
but to become identical with it, in a complete annihilation of individuality. To
achieve this goal, he tells us, we must avoid thinking of any determinate
form,149 strip the soul of all particular shape,150 and set aside all things other
than the One. 1s1 It is then that, in a fleeting blaze of light, there takes place
the metamorphosis of the self:
Then the seer no longer sees his object, for in that instant he no longer
distinguishes himself from it; he no longer has the impression of two
separate things, but he has, in a sense, become anothe,.. He is no longer
himself, nor does he belong to himself, but he is one with the One, as
the centre of one circle coincides with the centre of another .

4 Leaming How to Read
In the preceding pages, we have tried to describe - albeit too briefly - the
richness and variety of the practice of spiritual exercises in antiquity. We have
seen that, at first glance, they appear to vary widely. Some, like Plutarch's
etl1ismoi, designed to curb curiosity, anger or gossip, were · only practices
intended to ensure good moral habits. Others, particularly the meditations of
the Platonic tradition, demanded a high degree of mental concentration.
Some, like the contemplation of nature as practiced in all philosophical
schools, turned the soul toward the cosmos, while still others - rare and
exceptional - led to a transfiguration of the personality, as in the experiences
o( Plotinus. We also saw that the emotional tone and notional content of these
exercises varied widely from one philosophical school to another: from the
mobilization of energy and consent to destiny of the Stoics, to the relaxation
and detachment of the Epicureans, to mental concentration and renunciation
of the 11cnNible world among the Platonists.
Bcne111h 1 hi11 apparent di\'crsity, however, there is a profound unity, both
in the mc11nli c1111>loycd 11nd in the cndli purNued . The means employed arc
102 Spiritual Exercises
the rhetorical and dialectical techniques of persuasion, the attempts at
mastering one's inner dialogue, and mental concentration. In all philosophical
schools, the goal pursued in these exercises is self-realization and improvement.
All schools agree that man, before his philosophical conversion, is in a
state of unhappy disquiet. Consumed by worries, torn by passions, he does
not live a genuine life, nor is he truly himself. All schools also agree that man
can be delivered from this state. He can accede to genuine life, improve
himself, transform himself, and attain a state of perfection. It is precisely
for this that spiritual exercises are intended. Their goal is a kind of selfformation,
or paideia, which is to teach us to live, not in conformity with
human prejudices and social conventions - for social life is itself a product of
the passions - but in conformity with the nature of man, which is none other
than reason. Each in its own way, all schools believed in the freedom of the
will, thanks to which man has the possibility to modify, improve, and realize
himself. Underlying this conviction is the parallelism between physical and
spiritual exercises: just as, by dint of repeated physical exercises, athletes give
new form and strength to their bodies, so the philosopher develops his
strength of soul, modifies his inner climate, transforms his vision of the world,
and, finally, his entire being. 153 The analogy seems all the more self-evident
in that the gymnasion, the place where physical exercises were practiced, was
the same place where philosophy lessons were given; in other words, it was
also the place for training in spiritual gymnastics. 154
The quest for self-realization, final goal of spiritual exercises, is well
symbolized by the Plotinian image of sculpting one's own statue.155 It is often
misunderstood, since people imagine that this expression corresponds to a
kind of moral aestheticism. On this interpretation, ·its meaning would be to
adopt a pose, to select an attitude, or to fabricate a personality for oneself. In
fact, it is nothing of the sort. For the ancients, sculpture was an art which
"took away," as opposed to painting, an art which "added on." The statue
pre-existed in the marble block, and it was enough to take away what was
superfluous in order to cause it to appear . 156
One conception was common to all the philosophical schools: people are
unhappy because they are the slave of their passions. In other words, they are
unhappy because they desire things they may not be able to obtain, since they
are exterior, alien, and superfluous to them. It follows that happiness consists
in independence, freedom, and autonomy. In other words, happiness is the
return to the essential: that which is truly "ourselves," and which depends on
us.
This is obviously true in Platonism, where we find the famous image of
Glaucos, the god who lives in the depths of the sea. Covered as he is with
mud, seaweed, seashells, and pebbles, Glaucos is unrecogniznblc, and the
same holds true for the soul: the body is a kind of thick, coarse crui;t , covcrinl(
and completely disfiguring it, 11nd t he !ioul's t rue nu turc would 11ppc11r only if

it rose up out of the sea, throwing off everything alien to it. 157 The spiritual
exercise of apprenticeship for death, which consists in separpting oneself from
the body, its passions, and its desires, purifies the soul from all these
superfluous additions. It is enough to practice this exercise in order for the
soul to return to its true nature, and devote itself exclusively to the exercise
of pure thought.
Much the same thing can be said for Stoicism. With the help of the
distinction between what does and does not depend on us; we can reject all
that is alien to us, and return to our true selves. In other words, we can
achieve moral freedom.
Finally, the same also holds true for Epicureanism. By ignoring unnatural
and unnecessary desires, we can return to our original n ucleus of freedom and
independence, which may be defined by the satisfaction of natural and
necessary desires.
Thus, all spiritual exercises are, fundamentally, a return to the self, in
which the self is liberated from the state of alienation into which it has been
plunged by worries, passions, and desires. The "self" liberated in this way is
no longer merely our egoistic, passionate individuality: it is our moral person,
open to universality and objectivity, and participating in universal nature or
thought.
With the help of these exercises, we should be able to attain to wisdom;
that is, to a state of complete liberation from the passions, utter lucidity,
knowledge of ourselves and of the world. In fact, for Plato, Aristotle, the
Epicureans, and the Stoics, such an ideal of human perfection serves to define
divine perfection, a state by definition inaccessible to man.158 With the possible
exception of the Epicurean school, 1 59 wisdom was conceived as an ideal after
which one strives without the hope of ever attaining it. Under normal
circumstances, the only state accessible to man is philo-sophia: the love of, or
progress toward, wisdom. For this reason, spiritual exercises must be taken
up again and again, in an ever-renewed effort.
The philosopher lives in an intermediate state. He is not a sage, but he is
not a non-sage, either.160 He is therefore constantly torn between the
non-philosophical and the philosophical life, between the domain of the
habitual and the everyday, on the one hand, and, on the other, the domain of
consciousness and lucidity. 161 To the same extent that the philosophical life is
equivalent to the practice of spiritual exercises, it is also a tearing away from
eyeryday life. It is a conversion,162 a total transformation of one's vision,
life-style, and behavior.
Among the Cynics, champions of askesis, this engagement amounted to a
total break with the profane world, analogous to the monastic calling in
Christianity. The rupture took the form of a way of living, and even of dress,
cnm11lctcly fnreil{n to that of the rest of mankind. This is why it was
111
1mc1 imcN Naid thin C :yniciNrn w11N not· n phi losophy in the proper sense of the
104 Spiritual Exercises
term, but a state of life (enslasis). 163 In fact, however, all philosophical schools
engaged their disciples upon a new way of life, albeit in a more moderate way.
The practice of spiritual exercises implied a complete reversal of received
ideas: one was to renounce the false values of wealth, honors, and pleasures,
and turn towards the true values of virtue, contemplation, a simple life-style,
and the simple happiness of existing. This radical opposition explains the
reaction of non-philosophers, which ranged from the mockery we find
expressed in the comic poets, to the outright hostility which went so far as to
cause the death of Socrates.
The individual was to be torn away from his habits and social prejudices,
his way of life totally changed, and his way of looking at the world radically
metamorphosed into a cosmic-"physical" perspective. We ought not to
underestimate the depth and amplitude of the shock that these changes could
cause, changes which might seem fantastic and senseless to healthy, everyday
common sense. It was impossible to maintain oneself at such heights
continuously; this was a conversion that needed always to be reconquered. It
was probably because of such difficulties that, as we learn in Damascius' Life
of lsidorus, the philosopher Sallustius used to declare that philosophy was
impossible for man.1"' He probably meant by this that philosophers were not
capable of remaining philosophers at every instant of their lives. Rather, even
though they kept the title of "philosophers," they would be sure to fall back
into the habits of everyday life. The Skeptics, for instance, refused outright
to live philosophically, deliberately choosing to "live like everybody else," 1
65
although not until after having made a philosophical detour so intense that it
is hard to believe that their "everyday life" was quite so "everyday" as the)
seem to have pretended.
Our claim has been, then, that philosophy in antiquity was a spiritual
exercise. As for philosophical theories: they were either placed explicitly in
the service of spiritual practice, as was the case in Stoicism and Epicureanism,
or else they were taken as the objects of intellectual exercises, that is, of a
practice of the contemplative life which, in the last analysis, was itself nothing
other than a spiritual exercise. It is impossible to understand the philosophical
theories of antiquity without taking into account this concrete perspective,
since this is what gives them their true meaning.
When we read the works of ancient philosophers, the perspective we have
described should cause us to give increased attention to the existential
attitudes underlying the dogmatic edifices we encounter. Whether we have to
do with dialogues as in the case of Plato, class notes as in the case of Aristotle,
treatises like those of Plotinus, or commentaries like those of Proclus, a
philosopher's works cannot be interpreted without taking into consideration
the concrete situation which gave birth to them. They arc the product11 of n
philosophical school, in the most concrete sense of the term, in which n nu1s1c:r
forms his disciples, trying to guide t hem to sc:l f:.t r1111sfimm11 ion 1uul
Spiritual Exercises 1 05
-realization. Thus, the written work is a reflection of pedagogical, psychagogic,
and methodological preoccupations.
Although every written work is a monologue, the philosophical work is
always implicitly a dialogue. The dimension of the possible interlocutor is
always present within it. This explains the incoherencies and contradictions
which modern historians discover with astonishment in the works of ancient
philosophers. 166 In philosophical works such as these, thought cannot be
expressed according to the pure, absolute necessity of a systematic order.
Rather, it must take into account the level of the interlocutor, and the
concrete tempo of the logos in which it is expressed. It is the economy proper
to a given written logos which conditions its thought content, and it is the
logos that constitutes a living system which, in the words of Plato, "ought to
have its own body ... it must not lack either head or feet: it must have a
middle and extremities so composed as to suit each other and the whole
work." 167
Each logos is a "system," but the totality of logfli written by an author does
nol constitute a system. This is obviously true in the case of Plato's dialogues,
but it is equally true in the case of the lectures of Aristotle. For Aristotle's
writings are indeed neither more nor less than lecture-notes; and the error of
many Aristotelian scholars has been that they have forgotten this fact, and
imagined instead that they were manuals or systematic treatises, intended to
propose a complete exposition of a systematic doctrine. Consequently, they
have been astonished at the inconsistencies, and even contradictions, they
discovered between one writing and another. As Diiring168 has convincingly
shown, Aristotle's various logoi correspond to the concrete situations created
by specific academic debates. Each lesson corresponds to different conditions
and a specific problematic. It has inner unity, but its notional content docs
not overlap precisely with that of any other lesson. Moreover, Aristotle had
no intention of setting forth a complete system of reality . 169 Rather, he wished
to train his students in the technique of using correct methods in logic, the
natural sciences, and ethics. During gives an excellent description of the
Aristotelian method:
the most characteristic feature in Aristotle is his incessant discussion of
problems. Almost every important assertion is an answer to a question
put in a certain way, and is valid only as an answer to this particular
, question. That which is really interesting in Aristotle is his framing of
the problems, not his answers. It is part of his method of inquiry to
approach a problem or a group of problems again and again from
dillcrcnt anglc.. 'S. His own words are a.U.17vapzq JI Tr0l1]C1aµEIJOl ["now,

of the soul ... in each case the answer is the consequence of the manner
in which he posits the problem. In short, it is possible to explain this
type of inconsistencies as natural results of the method he applies. 170
In the Aristotelian method of "different starting-points," we can recognize
the method Aristophanes attributed to Socrates, and we have seen to what
extent all antiquity remained faithful to this method. 171 For this reason,
During's description can in fact apply, mutatis mutandis, to almost all the
philosophers of antiquity. Such a method, consisting not in setting forth a
system, but in giving precise responses to precisely limited questions, is the
heritage - lasting throughout antiquity - of the dialectical method; that is to
say, of the dialectical exercise.
To return to Aristotle: there is a profound truth in the fact that he himself
used to call his courses metlwdoi. 172 On this point, moreover, the Aristotelian
spirit corresponds to the spirit of the Platonic Academy, which was, above all,
a school which formed its pupils for an eventual political role, and a research
institute where investigations were carried out in a spirit of free discussion. 173
It may be of interest to compare Aristotle's methodology with that of
Plotinus. We learn from Porphyry that Plotinus took the themes for his
writings from the problems which came up in the course of his teaching. m
Plotinus' various logoi, situated as they are within a highly specific problematic,
are responses to precise questions. They are adapted to the needs of his
disciples, and are an attempt to bring about in them a specific psychagogic
effect. We must not make the mistake of imagining that they are the
successive chapters of a vast, systematic exposition of Plotinus' thought. In
each of these logoi, we encounter the spiritual method particular to Plotinus,
but there is no lack of incoherence and contradictions on points of detail when
we compare the doctrinal content of the respective treatises. 175
When we first approach the Neoplatonic commentaries on Plato and
Aristotle, we have the impression that their form and content are dictated
exclusively by doctrinal and exegetical considerations. Upon closer examination,
however, we realize that, in ·each commentary, the exegetical method
and doctrinal content arc functions of the spiritual level of the audience to
which the commentary is addressed. The reason for this is that there existed
a cursus of philosophical instruction, based on spiritual progress. One did not
read the same texts to beginners, to those in progress, and to those already
having achieved perfection, and the concepts appearing in the commentaries
are also functions of the spiritual capacities of their addressees. Consequently,
doctrinal content can vary considerably from one commentary to another,
even when written by the same author. This docs not mean that the
commentator changed his doctrines, but that the needs of his disciples were
differcnt.176 In the literary genre of parene.fis, used for exhorting beginners, one
could, in order to bring about 11 specific effect in t he interlncutor'N Nnul, utilize
Spiritual Exercises 1 07
the arguments of a rival school. For example, a Stoic might say, "even if
pleasure is the good of the soul (as the Epicureans would ha1
ve it), nevertheless
we must purify ourselves of passion." m Marcus Aurelius exhorted himself in
the same manner. If, he writes, the world is a mere aggregate of atoms, as the
Epicureans would have it, then death is not to be feared.178
Moreover, we ought not to forget that many a philosophical demonstration
derives its evidential force not so much from abstract reasoning as from an
experience which is at the same time a spiritual exercise. We have seen that
this was the case for the Plotinian demonstration of the immortality of the
soul. Let the soul practice virtue, he said, and it will understand that it is
immortal.179 We find an analogous example in the Christian writer Augustine.
In his On the Trinity, Augustine presents a series of psychological images of
the Trinity which do not form a coherent system, and which have consequently
been the source of a great deal of trouble for his commentators. In
fact, however, Augustine is not trying to present a systematic theory of
trinitarian analogies. Rather, by making the soul turn inward upon itself, he
wants to make it experience the fact that it is an image of the Trinity. In his
words: "These trinities occur within us and are within us, when we recall,
look at, and wish for such things." 180 Ultimately, it is in the triple act of
remembering God, knowing God, and loving God that the soul discovers
itself to be the image of the Trinity.
From the preceding examples, we may get some idea of the change in
perspective that may occur in our reading and interpretation of the philosophical
works of antiquity when we consider them from the point of view of the
practice of spiritual exercises. Philosophy then appears in its original aspect:
not as a theoretical construct, but as a method for training people to live and
to look at the world in a new way. It is an attempt to transform mankind.
Contemporary historians of philosophy are today scarcely inclined to pay
attention to this aspect, although it is an essential one. The reason for this is
that, in conformity with a tradition inherited from the Middle Ages and from
the modern era, they consider philosophy to be a purely abstract-theoretical
activity. Let us briefly recall how this conception came into existence.
It seems to be the result of the absorption of philosophia by Christianity .
Since its inception, Christianity has presented itself as a philosophia, insofar
as it assimilated into itself the traditional practices of spiritual exercises. We
see this occurring in Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Augustine, and monastici:im.
1"1 With the advent of medieval Scholasticism, however, we find a clear
distinction being drawn between theologia and philosophia. Theology became
conscious of its autonomy qua supreme science, while philosophy was emptied
of its spiritual exercises which, from now on, were relegated to Christian
mysticism nnd ethics. Reduced to the rank of a "handmaid of theology,"
philmmphy'N role waN henceforth to furnish theology with conceptual - and
ht•ncc purely t hcoret ie.:nl mnterinl . When, in the modern age, philosophy
108 Spiritual Exercises
regained its autonomy, it still retained many features inherited from this
medieval conception. In particular, it maintained its purely theoretical
character, which even evolved in the direction of a more and more thorough
systematization. 182 Not until Nietzsche, Bergson, and existentialism does
philosophy consciously return to being a concrete attitude, a way of life and
of seeing the world. For their part, however, contemporary historians of
ancient thought have, as a general rule, remained prisoners of the old, purely
theoretical conception of philosophy. Contemporary structuralist tendencies
do not, moreover, incline them to correct this misconception, since spiritual
exercises introduce into consideration a subjective, mutable, and dynamic
component, which does not fit comfortably into the structuralists' models of
explanation.
We have now returned to the contemporary period and our initial point of
departure, the lines by G. Friedmann we quoted at the beginning of this
study. We have tried to reply to those who, like Friedmann, ask themselves
the question: how is it possible to practice spiritual exercises in the twentieth
century? We have tried to do so by recalling the existence of a highly rich and
varied Western tradition. There can be no question, of course, of mechanically
imitating stereotyped schemas. After all, did not Socrates and Plato urge
their disciples to find the solutions they needed by themselves? And yet, we
cannot afford to ignore such a valuable quantity of experience, accumulated
over millennia. To mention but one example, Stoicism and Epicureanism do
seem to correspond to two opposite but inseparable poles of our inner life:
tension and relaxation, duty and serenity, moral conscience and the joy of
existence. 1K3
Vauvenargues said, "A truly new and truly original book would be one
which made people love old truths."1"" It is my hope that I have been "truly
new and truly original" in this sense, since my goal has indeed been to make
people love a few old truths. Old truths: ... there are some truths whose
meaning will never be exhausted by the generations of man. It is not that they
are difficult; on the contrary, they are often extremely simple.m Often, they
even appear to be banal. Yet for their meaning to be understood, these truths
must be lived, and constantly re-experienced. Each generation must take up,
from scratch, the task of learning to read and to re-read these "old truths."
We spend our lives "reading," that is, carrying out exegeses, and sometimes
even exegeses of exegeses. Epictetus tells us what he thinks of such activities:
"Come and listen to me read my commentaries ... I will explain
Chrysippus to you like no one else can, and I'll provide a complete
analysis of his entire text ... If necessary, I can even add the views of
Antipater and Archedcmos" . . . So it's for this, is it, thnt young men

Spiritual Exercises 109
And yet we have forgotten how to read: how to pause, liberate ourselves from
our worries, return into ourselves, and leave aside our searc)J for subtlety and
originality, in order to meditate calmly, ruminate, and let the texts speak to
us. This, too, is a spiritual exercise, and one of the most difficult. As Goethe
said: "Ordinary people don't know how much time and effort it takes to learn
how to read. I've spent eighty years at it, and I still can't say that I've reached
my goal." IB7

1 977, shortly before his death, Friedmann was kind enough to write me to tell
me how much he had been "moved" by my reaction to his book. In the same
letter, he referred me to the final remarks he had presented at the close of the
Colloquium organdies by the CNRS [National Centre of Scientific Research],
3-5 May, 1977, to commemorate the tricentenary of the death of Spinoza.
There, apropos of a passage from Spinoza's Ethics, he spoke of the Stoicism of
the ancients. Cf. Georges Friedmann, "Le Sage et notre siecle," Revue de

18 Many Stoic treatises entitled On Exercises have been lost; cf. the list of titles in
Diogenes Laertius, 7, 166-7. A short treatise entitled On Exercise, by Musonius
Rufus, has been preserved (pp. 22-7 Hense). After a general introduction
concerning the need for exercises in philosophy, Rufus recommends physical
exercises: becoming used to foul weather, hunger, and thirst. These exercises
benefit the soul, giving it strength and temperance. He then recommends
exercises designed particularly for the soul, which, says Rufus, consist in steeping
oneself in the demonstrations and principles bearing on the distinction between
real and apparent goods and evils. With the help of these exercises, we will get
into the habit of not fearing what most people consider as evils: poverty,
suffering, and death. One chapter of Epictetus' Disco1mes is dedicated to askesis
(3, 1 2, 1-7). Cf. bc:low. The: treatise 011 Exerdse by the PseudoPlutarch, preserved
in Arabic (cf. J. Gildmeister and F. Bilcheler, "PseudoPlutarchos Peri askisefis,"

36 Marcus Aurelius, Medi1a1ior1s, 1, 58: "In every contingency, keep before .vour e.ves
those who, when the same thing befell them, were saddened, astonished,
resentful. Where are they now? Nowhere." Epictetus, Manual, ch. 21: "Keep
before .vour e.ves every day death and exile, and everything that seems terrible, but
most of all death; and then you will never have any abject thought, nor excessive
desire." On this exercise, see Rabbow, Seelenj'iihrU11g, p. 330.
37 Cf. the passage from Philo cited above. Hijmans, AJ:KEJ:IJ:, p. 69, calls attention
to the frequency of the expression "Remember!" in Epictetus. It recurs quite
often in Marcus Aurelius, for instance, Meditations, 2, 4; 8, 15; 29. Cf. Galen,
Galer1 On the Passions and E"ors of the So11/, l, 5, 25, p. 1 9, 8- 10 Marquardt:
"With the help of memory, keep 'at hand' the ugliness of those who succumb to
anger, and the beauty of those who master it."
38 It is only after much hesitation that I have translated mtlete by "meditation." In
fact, melett and iL'I Latin equivalent meditatifl designate "preparatory exercises,"
in particular those of rhetoricians. If 1 ha\•e finally resigned myself to adopting
the translation "meditation," it is because the exercise designated by mtltte
corresponds, in the last analysis, rather well to what we nowadays term
meditatio11: an effort to assimilate an idea, notion, or principle, and make
them come alive in the soul. We must not, however, lose sight of the term's ambiguity:
meditation is exercise, and exercise is meditation. For instance, the "premeditation"
of death is a "pre-exercise" of death; the (Oltidiana meditatio cited in
the following note could just as well be translated as "daily exercises."
39 See Rabbow, See/enfiihrung, pp. 23-1 50, 325-8; and Seneca, On Benefits, 1, 2, 1:
"These are the things that my friend Demetrius says the beginner in philosophy
must grasp with both hands, these arc the precepts that he must never let go.
Rather, he must cling fast to them and make them a part of himself, and by daily
meditation reach the point where thc.'lc salutary maxims occur to him of their
own accord." Cf. also Galen, Ga/e11 011 t/1e Passior1s anti E"nrs 1if tl1t Soul, l , 5,

that he is giving in to some shameful passion, or giving his consent to something
evil or unjust - or even committing it - and if, instead, the soul's faculties of

53 The term akroasis as used by Philo could designate, among other things, attending
a course in philosophy; cf. Epictetus, Discourses, 3, 23, 27; 38. Normally, the course
included the reading, with commentary, of a philosophical text (anagnosis}, often
done by the disciple and criticized by the master (cf. Epictetus, Discourses, l, 26,
l; Porphyry, Lij( of Plotinus, ch. 14). See also I. Bruns, De si:hola Epirlelc, Kiel
1897. This does not, of course, exclude the individual reading of philosophical
texts; cf. Epictetus, Discourses, 4, 4, 14-1 8 (where Epictetus reproaches his
disciples for reading texts without putting them into practice). After the reading
with commentary, a philosophy class would normally include a discussion
(diatribe) with the audience, as well as individual discussions (cf. I. Hadot, Se11eca,
p. 65). For the listener, this entire ensemble could be a spiritual exercise. With
regard to reading, we should add that exegesis, whether literal or allegorical, was
one of the most important spiritual exercises at the end of antiquity, among both
pagans and Christians.

aphorisms to epitomai (summaries of basic principles), and finally to full-scale

55 On the exercise of definition, sec below.
56 On this exercise, sec Rabbow, See/mfiihrung, pp. 42-9.
57 Philo's expression "indifference to indifferent things" corresponds exactly to the
spiritual exercises mentioned by Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 1 1 , 16: "Our
soul finds within itself the power to live a perfectly happy life, if we can
remain indi fferent towards indifferent things." This formula seems to be a
reminiscence of the definition of the goal of human life according to Aristo of
Chios (SVF, 1, §360, = Clement of Alexandria, Stromatfl, 2, 21, 1 29, 6, p. 183,
14-16 Stiihlin): "And why should I mention Aristo? He said the goal was
indifference, but he leaves 'the indifferent' as simply 'the indifferent.' " On this
theme, see below. We must bear in mind that here "indifference" does not mean
a lack of interest, but rather equal love for each of life's instants; that is, we are
not to make any "difference" between them.
58 See Rabbow, Su/enfiihr11ng, pp. 223-49; Ingcnkamp, Plutarclls Sd1iifien,

69 Lucretius, On tlie Nature of Things, 3, 1 6f, 28ff. This passage is quite remarkable.
On the one hand, it illustrates the fact that Epicurean physics was a true source
of pleasure for the sage: it allowed him to have a grandiose imaginative vision of
the formation and dissolution of the universe in the infinity of space. On the
other, it throws light on one of the most fundamental feelings of the human
experience: l1orror in the face of the enigma of nature. One thinks of Goethe's
formulation in Faust, Part 2, 6272ff: "The shudder is the best part of man.
However dearly the world makes him pay for it, he feels the Prodigious deep
inside, seized with astonishment." ("Das Schaudcrn ist der Menschheit bestes
Teil. Wie auch die Welt ihm das Gefilhl verteure, Ergriffen ftihlt er tief das

79 The prehistory of spiritual exercises is to be sought, first of all, in traditional rules
of life and popular exhortation (cf. I. Hadot, Seneca, pp. 1 0-22). Must we go back
further still, and look for it first of all in Pythagoreanism, and then, beyond
Pythagoras, in magico-religious/shamanistic traditions of respiratory techniques
and mnemonic exercises? This theory, defended by E.R. Dodds, The Greeks and
the lrratio11al (= Sather Classical Lectures 25), 3rd edn, Berkeley/London 1 963;
L. Gernet, Anthropo/ogie de la Grece antique, Paris 1 968, pp. 423-5; J.-P. Vernant,

is entirely plausible. However, I shall not go into the matter here, first of all
owing to my lack of competence in the field of the anthropology of prehistory
and of archaic Greece, and secondly, because it seems to me that the problems
inherent in the history of Pythagoreanism are extremely complex, so that it
presupposes a rigorous criticism of our sources (many of which are late, idyllic
projections, reflecting Stoic and Platonic concepts). Thirdly, the spiritual exercises
under discussion here are mental processes which have nothing in common
with cataleptic trances, but, on th� contrary, respond to a rigorous demand for
rational control, a demand which, as far as we are concerned, emerges with the
figure of Socrates.
80 The historical Socrates is a probably insoluble enigma. But the figure of
Socrates, as it is sketched by Plato, Xenophon, and Aristophanes, is a wellattested
historical fact. When, in what follows, I speak of "Socrates," I
shall be referring to this figure of Socrates. See below, ch. 5, "The Figure of
Socrates."
81 By using quotation marks, I wish to underline the fact that we arc not
dealing with authentically Socratic dialoi,'Ucs, but with literary composit ions
which imitate - more or less faithfully - the dinlogues of SocrnteH, or in which
the figure of Socrates plays a role . h is in this sense thnt Plotn111 JinlogueR 11rc
Socrntic.
Spiritual Exercises 1 1 7
82 Plato, Laches, 1 87e-1 88b.
83 Aristotle, Sophistical Refutations, 1 83b8: "Socrates used to ask _questions and not
to answer them - for he used to confess that he did not 1'now." Cf. Plato,
Apology, 2 ld5: "I do not think that I know what I do not know."
84 Plato, Apology, 30el-5: "If you put me to death, you will not easily find anyone
to take my place ... God has specially appointed me to this city, as though it
were a large thoroughbred horse which ... needs the stimulation of some
stinging fly."
85 On taking care of oneself, cf. Plato, Apology, 29d; 31 b; 36c.
86 Ibid, 29d5-e3. Cf. 30a6-bl: "For I spend my time going about trying to persuade
you, young and old, to make your first and chief concern not for your bodies nor
for your possessions, but for the highest welfare of your souls."
87 Plato, Apo/11gy, 36b4-c6.
88 Plato, Symposium, 2 1 5e6-2 1 6a5.
89 In this respect, Stoic exhortation remains Socratic. More than one of Epictetus'
Di1&ourses seems to imitate the Socratic style; cf., for instance, Discourses, I, 1 1 ,
1 -40. Epictetus praises the Socratic method ,t 2, 12, 5-1 6, but he empha.'lizes
that, in his day, it is no longer easy to practice it: "Nowadays, especially in Rome,
it is not at all a safe business" (2, 1 2, 1 7; 24). Epictetus pictures a philosopher
trying to have a Socratic dialogue with a consular personage, and ending up
receiving a fist in the face. If we can trust Diogenes Laertius, LiVts of the
Philosophers, 2, 21, a similar incident had happened to Socrates himself.
90 On the history of this theme, see Pierre Courcelle, Connais-toi toi-mime. De
So(rate ti saint Bernard, 3 vols, Paris 1 974--5.
91 Plato, Symposium, 174d.
92 Plato, ibid, 220c--d.
93 Aristophanes, Clouds, 700-6, · 76 1-3; cf. 740-5. As a matter of fact, the true
meaning of these verses is not entirely clear. They could be interpreted as an
allusion to an exercise of mental concentration; this is the view of G. Meautis,
l 'time hellb1ique, Paris 1 932, p. 1 83; A.-J. Festugiere, Contemplation ti vie
conttmplatit-e selon Platot1, 2nd edn, Paris 1950, pp. 67-73; W. Schmid, "Das
Sokratcsbild der Wolken," Phitologus 91 (1948), pp. 209-28; A.E. Taylor, Vaina
Socratica, Oxford 191 1, pp. 1 29-7 5. The terms phrontizein and ekphrontizein,
used in Aristophanes' description, became - perhaps under Aristophanes'
influence - technical terms for designating Socrates' habits. Cf. Plato, Symposium,
220c: Socrates stays standing, phrontizot1 ti; Xenophon, Symposium, 6, 6: Socrates
is nicknamed the plirontislts. But it is not certain that, in Aristophanes, this
phrontizein corresponds to an exercise of meditation directed towards oneself. In
the first place, the comparison with the may-beetle gives us to understand that
thought takes flight toward "elevated" things. In his Symposium, Xenophon tells
us it relates to the "meteora," in other words to celestial phenomena (cf. Plato,
Ap11logy, 1 8b). Secondly, in the Clouds, Strepsiades phrontizei about the means he
will use to settle a business affair, not about himself. It is more a question of the
mcrhmlolo1n· of research (cf. I. 742: 1lit1ide nod e.wm1ine). The most interesting

jump to another" (702-4), repeated at 743ff: "If an idea gets you into
any difficulty, let go of it, withdraw for a bit, then submit it to your judgement
again, shift it around and weigh it carefully." This means that, when one
arrives at an aporia, one must take up the question again, from a new point of
departure. This method is constantly applied in the Platonic dialogues, as has
been shown by Rene Schaerer, La Question platonidenne. Etudes sur /es rapports
de la penste et de /'expressions dans /es Dialogues (= Memoires de l'Universite
de Neuchatel 1 0), 2nd edn with postscript, Neuchatel 1 969, pp. 84-7; citing
Meno, 79e; Pltaedo, 1 05b; Theaetetus, 1 87a-b; Phi/ebus, 60a. As Schaerer
points out (p. 86), we have to do with a process "which forces the
mind indefatigably to tum around in circles, in search of the True." It is perhaps
this aspect of Socratic methodology which explains Aristophanes' allusions to
decours and circuits of thought. Be this as it may, this method is also discernible
in Aristotle, as we can sec by the examples collected by H. Bonitz, lnde.t·
aristotelicus, Berlin 1 870, repr. Graz 1 955, col. 1 1 1, 35ff: "Taking another point
of departure, we shall say." We find Plotinus using the same method, for instance
in Enm:ad, 5, 8, 4, 45; 5, 8, 1 3, 24; 6, 4, 1 6, 47. On Aristotle, cf. the remarks
of I. Di.iring, "Aristotle and the heritage from Plato," Eranos 62 ( 1964),
pp. 84-99.
94 Diogenes Lacrtius, lives of the Philosophers, 6, 6. Ancient man frequently spoke to
himself out loud. Some examples: Pyrrho in Diogenes Laertius 9, 64 (= Long and
Sedley, Hellenistic Philosophers, IA, vol. 1, p. 13; vol. 2, p. 3): "When once discovered
talking to himself, he was asked the reason, and said that he was training to be
virtuous." Philo of Athens, in Diogenes Laertius, lives of the P/1ilosophers, 9, 69: "Philo
... had a habit of very often talking to himself . . . that i.o; why Timon says of him:
'Philo ... he who, apart from mankind, used to speak and converse with himself, with
no concern for glory or disputcs.' " Qcanthcs, in Diogenes Laertius, lii:es of che
Philosop/1ers, 1, 171: [Cleanthcs] used often to scold himself out loud. Upon hearing
him, Ariston once asked him: 'Who are you scolding?' Cleanthes laughed and replied,
'Some old man who has grey hair but no brains.' " Horace, Satires, I, 4, 137: "Thus,
with lips shut tight, I debate with myself." ("Hacc ego mecum compressis agito
labris.") Epictetus, Discourses, 3, 1 4, 2: "Man - if you really an: a man - then walk by
yourself, talk to yourself, and don't hide yourself in the chorus." On meditating while
walking, cf. Horace, letter, 1, 4, 4-5: "strolling peacefully amid the healthful woods,

He struck himself on the chest and spoke to his heart and scolded it:
"Bear up, my heart. You have had worse to endure before this
on that day when the irresistible Cyclops ate up my strong companions ... "
So he spoke, addressing his own dear heart within him;
and the heart in great obedience endured and stood it
without complaint, but the man himself was twisting and turning.

This passage is quoted by Plato, Republic, 441b: "there Homer has clearly
represented that in us which has reflected about the better and the worse as
rebuking that which feels unreasoning anger as if it were a distinct and different
thing." Cf. Phaedo, 94d-e.
95 Thus, according to Porphyry, Life of Plotinus, 8, 19: "Plotinus was present at the
same time to himself and to others." [On this theme, sec Pierre Hadot, Plotin ou

dialogues, p. 3, citing Pl ato, Statesman, 285-6. Cf. ibid, pp. 1 62-3; Schaercr, La
Qpestion platonicienne, p. 216.
102 Plato, Statesman, 285c-d.
103 Ibid, 286d. In the words of Schaercr (La Question platonicienne, p. 87): "Definitions
arc worthless in and of themselves. Their entire value consists in the road
travelled to achieve them. Along the way, the interlocutor acquires more met11al
penetration (Sophist, 227a-b), more cotifidence ( Theaetttus, 1 87b), and more
skillfulness in all things (Statesman , 285dff). His soul is thereby purified, as he
rejects the opinions which formerly barred the way co enlightenment (Sophist,
230b-c). But whatever words one uses to designate this dialectical progress, it
always takes place in the soul of the interlocutor - and, by the same token, in the
soul of the intelligent reader."
104 Cf. Schaerer, La Question platonicienne, pp. 38-44; Goldschmidt Les dialogues, pp.
79-80, 292, and 341: "The Republic solves the problem of Justice and its
advantages. At the same time, and by the same token, it urges us on towards
Justice." On the cxhortatory character of the dialogues, see K. Gaiser, Protreptik

1 14 Cf. Plato, Phaedo, 84a: "The philosophical soul calms the sea of the passions,
following the course of reasoning and always being present within it, contemplating
and drawing nourishment from the true, the divine, and that which is not
subject to opinion." Cf. ibid, 6Se, 66c, 79c, 81b, 83b-d.

theme of gratitude.
1 20 Michel de Montaigne, Essays, bk I, ch. 20, vol. 1, p. 87 Villey/Saulnier = vol.
1, p. 111 Ives. Cf. Seneca, Leiter, 26, 8: "Meanwhile Epicurus will oblige me with
these words: 'Think on death,' or rather, if you prefer the phrase, on 'migration
to heaven.' The meaning is clear - that it is a wonderful thing to learn thoroughly
how to die ... 'think on death.' In saying this, he bids us think on freedom ...
He who has learned to die has un-leamed slavery. [.Qui mori didicit, servire
dedidicit.]" As we can see, the Stoic Seneca borrowed the maxim "Meditare
mortem" from Epicurus.
121 Epictetus, Manual, ch. 21. Cf. Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 2, 1 1: "Let your
every deed and word and thought be those of one who might depart from this

Heidegger, Sein und Zeit, §53, pp. 260ff. As R. Brague pointed out in his review
of the first edition of this work (Eludes phi/osophiques, 1982), Heidegger here "is
careful to distinguish Being-for-Death from the metlitatio mortis." It is perfectly
true that Heideggerian Being-for-Death only takes on its full meaning within the
perspective particular to Heidegger; it is nonetheless true: that we have here a
system which makes of the anticipation or forcstnlling of Lleath 11 prccomlillon of

not simply to think about death, but to carry out a training for dying which is, in
reality, a training for life.
1 24 Cf. Plato, Republic, 525c, 532b8, and especially 5 18c: "the true analogy for this
indwelling power in the soul and the organ whereby each of us learns is that of an
eye that could not be converted to the light from the darkness except by turning
the whole body. Even so this organ of knowledge must be turned around from the
world of becoming together with the entire soul ... until it is able to endure the
contemplation of that which is. Education is the art of turning this eye of the soul."
1 25 Plato, Republic, 604b-d.
1 26 Should we call this exercise already Stoic, or should we rather say that Stoic
exercises are still Platonic?

spectator of himself and his works, and not merely a spectator, but also an
interpreter ... Nature . . . did not end [i.e. in the case of mankind] until she
reached contemplation and understanding and a manner of life harmonious with
nature. Take heed, therefore, lest you die without ever having been spectators of
these things. You arc wi lling to travel to Olympia to look at the work of Pheidias,
and each of you regards it as a misfortune to die without seeing such sights; yet
when there is no need to travel at all, when you have such works near you and
under your noses, will you not yearn to look at these works and know them? Will
you consequently refuse to learn either who you are, or for what you have been
born, or what is the meaning of the spectacle to which you have been admitted?"

spiritual exercises.

the average man's: "He lived in fraternal piety with his sister, a midwife ... now
and then even taking things for sale to market, poultry or pigs for instance, and
with complete indifference he would clean the house. It is said that he was so
indifferent that he washed a piglet himself." (Diogenes Laertius, Lives of the
Philosophers, 9, 66.) All that mattered was one's inner attitude; therefore the sage
conformed to "life," i.e. to the opinions of non-philosophers. But he did so with
indifference, that is, wjth an inner freedom which preserved his serenity and
peace of mind. This is, incidentally, the same Pyrrho who, when frightened by
a dog, replied to his mocking onlookers: "It is difficult to strip oneselr completely
of being human." (Diogenes Lacrtius, Lives of the Philosophers, 9, 66, fr. JC Long

treated according to the principles of the various schools." On this theme,
cf. I. Hadot, Sene,a, pp. 3, 21, 44, 54, 83; 1969b, p. 351. We ought therefore not
to be surprised to find the Stoic Seneca utilizing Epicurean aphorisms to exhort
his disciple Lucilius; cf. I. Hadot, Seneca, p. 83. A concrete example of this
parenetic eclecticism may be found in the manuscript Vati,anus Graeros 1950.
According to Festugiere, La rrotlation, vol. 2, p. 90, n. 2: "It is interesting to

Marcus Aurelius (f. 341fT), then the Manual of Epictetus (f. 392•), and finally,
after a page of rhetorical pieces (f. 401 ), the collectfon of Epicurean aphorisms
entitled Gnomologium Vaticanum (f. 401•fT.). This whole ensemble, including the
selections from Epicurus, is the work of a Stoic, who has gathered together for
his personal use a number of fundamental texts on moral doctrine - a kind of
'book of devotion', as it were. Now, the first item on the list is the Socrates of
the Memorabilia."

best witnesses for the ancient tradition of spiritual exercises. He emphasizes the

psychagogy (ibid, I, 2, 20, 1 ), and the need for exercises and a hunt after the
truth (ibid, I, 2, 21, 1: "the truth reveals itself full of sweetness when one has
searched for it and obtained it at the cost of great efforts.")

Ancient Spiritual Exercises
and "Christian Philosophy"
It was the great merit of Paul Rabbow to have shown, in his Seelmfiihrung, 1
in what sense the methods of meditation set forth and practiced in Ignatius
of Loyola's Exercilia spirilua/ia2 were deeply rooted in the spiritual
exercises of ancient philosophy. Rabbow begins his book by discussing the
various techniques by means of which rhetoricians throughout antiquity
sought to persuade their audiences. These included, for example, oratorical
amplification and lifelike, stirring descriptions of events.3 Above all, Rabbow
gives a remarkable analysis of the exercises practiced by the Stoics and
Epicureans, emphasizing the point that they were spirilual exercises of
the same kind as we find in Ignatius of Loyola. On both these points,
Rabbow's book opened the way to new areas of research. It is possible,
however, that even the author himself did not foresee all the consequences of
his discovery.
In the first place, Rabbow seems to me to have linked the phenomenon of
spiritual exercises too closely to what he terms the "inward orientation"
(lnnenwendung)• which, he claims, took place in the Greek mentality in the
third century BC, and which manifested itself in the development of the Stoic
and Epicurean schools. As a matter of fact, however, this phenomenon was
much more widespread. We can already detect its outlines in the Socratic/Platonic
dialogues, and it continues right up until the end of antiquity.
The reason for this is that it is linked to the very essence of ancient
philosophy. It is philosophy itself that the ancients thought of as a spiritual
exercise.
If Rabbow tends to limit the extent of spiritual exercises to the Hellenistic/Roman
period, the reason is perhaps that he restricts himself to considering
their ethical aspect alone. Moreover, he considers ethics only in
philosophies like Stoicism and Epicurcanism, which uppcnr to 1u:cord 1irc-
Ancient Spiritual Exercises 1 27
dominance to ethical questions in their instruction. In fact, Rabbow goes so
far as to define spiritual exercises as moral exercises:
By "moral exercise," we mean a procedure or determinate act, intended
to influence oneself, carried out with the express goal of achieving a
determinate moral effect. It always looks beyond itself, in as much as it
repeats itself, or at least is linked together with other acts to form a
methodical ensemble.5
With the advent of Christianity, Rabbow continues, these moral exercises
were transformed into spiritual exercises:
Spiritual exercises, then, which resemble moral exercises like a twin,
both in essence and structure, were raised to their classical rigor and
perfection in the Exercitia spiritua/ia of Ignatius of Loyola. Spiritual
exercises thus belong properly to the religious sphere, since their goal is
to fortify, maintain, and renew life "in the Spirit," the vita spiritualis. 6
Christian spiritual exercises did indeed take on a new meaning by virtue of
the specific character of Christian spirituality, inspired as it is by the death of
Christ and the Trinitarian life of the divine Persons. But to speak, apropos of
the philosophical exercises of antiquity, of simple "moral exercises" is to
misunderstand their importance and significance. As we showed above, these
exercises have as their goal the transformation of our vision of the world, and
the metamorphosis of our being. They therefore have not merely a moral, but
also an existential value. We are not just dealing here with a code of good
moral conduct, but with a way of being, in the strongest sense of the term. In
the last analysis, then, the term "spiritual exercises" is the best one, because
it leaves no doubt that we are dealing with exercises which engage the totality
of the spirit. 7
Secondly, one gets the impression from reading Rab bow that Ignatius of
Loyola rediscovered spiritual exercises thanks to the sixteenth-century
renaissance of rhetorical studies.8 In fact, however, rhetoric for the ancients
was only one of many ingredients of exercises which were first and foremost
philosophical in the strict sense of the term. Moreover, ever since the first
centuries of the church's existence, Christian spirituality has been the heir of
anc;.ient philosophy and its spiritual practices. There was thus nothing to
prevent Ignatius from finding the methodology for his Exercitia within the
Christian tradition itself. In the following pages, we hope to show, with
the help of a few quotations, in what way ancient spiritual exercises
were preserved and transmitted by an entire current of ancient
Christian thouicht: that current, namely, which defined Christianity itself as

128 Spiritual Exercises
Before we begin our study, we must be more specific about the notion of
spiritual exercises. "Exercise" corresponds to the Greek terms askesis or
melete. Let us be clear at the outset about the limits of the present inquiry:
we shall not be discussing "asceticism" in the modem sense of the word, as
it is defined, for instance, by Heussi: "Complete abstinence or restriction in
the use of food, drink, sleep, dress, and property, and especially continence
in sexual matters." 9 Here, we must carefully distinguish between two
different phenomena. On the one hand, there is the Christian - and
subsequently modem - use of the word "asceticism", as we have just seen it
defined. On the other, there is use of the word askesis in ancient philosophy.
For ancient philosophers, the word askesis designated exclusively the spiritual
exercises we have discussed above: 10 inner activities of the thought and the
will. Whether or not sexual or alimentary practices analogous to those of
Christian asceticism existed among certain ancient philosophers - the Cynics,
for example, or the Neoplatonists - is a wholly different question. Such
practices have nothing to do with philosophical thought-exercises. This
question has been competently dealt with by many authors,1 1 who have shown
both the analogies and the differences between asceticism (in the modern
sense of the word) in ancient philosophy and in Christianity. What we
propose to examine here is rather the way in which as/mis, in the philosophical
sense of the term, was received into Christianity.
In order to understand the phenomenon under consideration, it is essential
to recall that there was a widespread Christian tradition which portrayed
Christianity as a philosop�y. This assimilation began with those Christian
writers of the second century who are usually referred to as the Apologists, and
in particular with Justin. The Apologists considered Christianity a philosophy,
and to mark its opposition to Greek philosophy, they spoke of Christianity as
"our philosophy" or as "Barbarian philosophy." 12 They did not, however,
consider Christianity to be just one philosophy among others; they thought of
it as the philosophy. They believed that that which had been scattered and
dispersed throughout Greek philosophy had been synthesi7.ed and systematized
in Christian philosophy. Each Greek philosopher, they wrote, had possessed
only a portion of the Logos, 13 whereas the Christians were in possession of the
logos itself, incarnated in Jesus Christ. If to do philosophy was to live in
accordance with the law of reason, then the Christians were philosophers, since
they lived in conformity with the law of the divine Logos.1•
Clement of Alexandria dwells at length on this theme. He establishes a close
link between philosophy and paideia, by which he means the education of
mankind. Already within Greek philosophy, the Logos, or divine pedagogue,
had been at work educating humanity, but Christianity itself, as the complete
revelation of the logos, was the true philosophy15 which "teaches us to
conduct ourselves so that we may resemble God, and to nccepl the divine plan
[oikonomial as the guiding principle of all our cduc111 ion.11 16
Ancient Spiritual Exercises 129
The identification of Christianity with true philosophy inspired many
aspects of the teaching of Origen, and it remained influentiaL throughout the
Origenist tradition, especially among the Cappadocian Fathers: Basil of
Caesarea, Gregory Nazianzen, and Gregory of Nyssa. It is also in evidence in
John Chrysostom. 17 All these authors speak of "our philosophy"; of the
"complete philosophy"; or of "the philosophy according to Christ. "
We may well ask ourselves if such an identification was legitimate, and
wonder whether it did not contribute to a large extent to the notorious
"Hellenization" of Christianity, about which so much has been written. I will
not go into this complex problem here, but shall limit myself to pointing out
that in portraying Christianity as a philosophy, this tradition was the heir -
almost certainly consciously so - of a tendency already at work in the Jewish
tradition, particularly in Philo of Alexandria. 18 Philo portrayed Judaism as a
patrios phi/osophia: the traditional philosophy of the Jewish people. The same
terminology was used by Flavius Josephus. 19
When, a few centuries later, monasticism came to represent the culmination
of Christian perfection, it, too, could be portrayed as a philosophia. From the
fourth century on, this is exactly how it was in fact described, by church
Fathers such as Gregory Nazianzen,20 Gregory of Nyssa, and John Chrysostom,21
and especially by Evagrius Ponticus.22 This viewpoint was still current
in the fifth century, for instance in Theodoret of Cyrrhus.13
Here again, it was Philo of Alexandria who had shown the way. He had
given the name "philosophers" to the Therapeutae, who, according to his
description,24 lived in solitude, meditating on the law and devoting themselves
to contemplation. Jean Leclercq25 has shown that, under the influence of
Greek tradition, the monastic life continued to be designated by the term
phi/osophia throughout the Middle Ages. Thus, a Cistercian monastic text tells
us that Bernard of Clairvaux used to initiate his disciples "into the disciplines
of celestial philosophy. " 26 Finally, John of Salisbury maintained that it was
the monks who "philosophized" in the most correct and authentic way.27
The importance of this assimilation between Christianity and philosophy
cannot be over-emphasized. Let us be clear on one point, however: there can
be no question of denying the incomparable originality of Christianity. We
shall return to this point later; in particular, we shall emphasize the
specifically Christian character of this "philosophy," as well as the care
Christians have taken to connect it with the biblical/ evangelical tradition.
Moreover, the tendency to assimilation was confined within strict historical
limits, and always linked more or less closely to the tradition of the Apologists
and of Origen. This tendency did, however, exist; its importance was
considerable, and its result was the introduction of philosophical spiritual
exercises into Christianity.
A long with its 11hsorption of spiritual exercises, Christi�
nity acquired a
KJll'Ci lic 11tyk· of' life, spiritu11l 1lt tit udc, nnd 1.on11lity, which h11d been absent
1 30 Spiritual Exercises
from primitive Christianity. This fact is highly significant: it shows that if
Christianity was able to be assimilated to a philosophy, the reason was that
philosophy itself was already, above all else, a way of being and a style of life.
As Jean Leclercq points out: "In the monastic Middle Ages, just as much as
in Antiquity, philosophia did not designate a theory or a means of knowledge,
but a lived, experienced wisdom, and a way of living according to reason." za
We remarked above29 that the fundamental attitude of the Stoic philosopher
was prosoche: attention to oneself and vigilance at every instant. For the Stoics,
the person who is "awake" is always perfectly conscious not only of what he
does, but of what he is. In other words, he is aware of his place in the universe
and of his relationship to God. His self-consciousness is, first and foremost,
a moral consciousness.
A person endowed with such consciousness seeks to purify and rectify his
intentions at every instant. He is constantly on the lookout for signs within
himself of any motive for action other than the will to do good. Such
self-consciousness is not, however, merely a moral conscience; it is also cosmic
consciousness. The "attentive" person lives constantly in the presence of God
and is constantly remembering God, joyfully consenting to the will of
universal reason, and he sees all things with the eyes of God himself.
Such is the philosophical attitude par excellence. It is also the attitude of the
Christian philosopher. We encounter this attitude already in Clement of
Alexandria, in a passage which foreshadows the spirit which was later to reign
in philosophically-inspired monasticism: "It is necessary that divine law
inspire fear, so that the philosopher may acquire and conserve peace of mind
[ amerimtiia ], by dint of prudence [ eulabeia] and attention to himself [prosoche],
and that he may remain exempt from sins and falls in all things." JO For
Clement, the divine law is simultaneously the universal reason of the
philosophers, and the divine word of the Christians. It inspires fear, not in
the sense of a passion - which, as such, would be condemned by the Stoics -
but rather in the sense of a certain circumspection in thought and action.
Such attention to oneself brings about amerimnia or peace of mind, one of the
most sought-after goals in monasticism.
Attention to oneself is the subject of a very important sermon by Basil of
Caesarea.31 Basil bases his sermon on the Greek version of a passage from
Deuteronomy: "Give heed to yourself, lest there be a hidden word in your
heart." 32 On this basis, Basil develops an entire theory of prosoche, strongly
influenced by ·the Stoic and Platonic traditions. We shall return to this point
later. For the moment, let us simply note that Basil's reason for commenting
on this particular passage of Deuteronomy is that, for him, it evokes a technical
term of ancient philosophy. For Basil, attention to oneself consists in
awakening the rational principles of thought and action which God has placed
in our souls.33 We arc to watch over 011rselves - that is, over our 11piri1 and our
soul - nnd nol over th111 which i11 mm (our body) or 1 hn1 whkh iN rllmul 11/11mt
Ancient Spiritual Exercises 131
us (our possessions).3'1 Thus, prosoche consists in paying attention to the
beauty of our souls, by constantly renewing the examination 06 our conscience
and our knowledge of ourselves.35 By so doing, we can correct the judgments
we bring upon ourselves. If we think we are rich and noble, we are to recall
that we are made of earth, and ask ourselves where are the famous men who
have preceded us now. If, on the contrary, we are poor and in disgrace, we
are to take cognizance of the riches and splendors which the cosmos offers us:
our body, the earth, the sky, and the stars, and we shall then be reminded of
our divine vocation.36 It is not hard to recognize the philosophical character
of these themes.
Prosoche or attention17 to oneself, the philosopher's fundamental attitude,
became the fundamental attitude of the monk. We can observe this phenomenon
in Athanasius' Life of Antony, written in AD 357. When describing the
saint's conversion to the monastic life, Athanasius simply says: "He began to
pay attention to himself."38 Antony himself, we read later, is supposed to have
said to his disciples on his deathbed: "Live as though you were dying every
day, paying heed to yourselves fprosechontes heautois] and remembering what
you heard from my preaching." 39
In the sixth century, Dorotheus of Gaza remarked: "We are so negligent
that we do not know why we have gone out of the world ... That is why we
are not making progress ... The reason for it is that there is no prosocke in
our hearts." "° As we have seen;• attention and vigilance presuppose continuous
concentration on the present moment, which must be lived as if it were,
simultaneously, the first and last moment of life. Athanasius tells us that
Antony used to make no attempt to remember the time he had already spent
at his exercises, but rather made a brand new effort every day, as if starting
afresh from zero.42 In other words, he lived the present moment as if it were
his first, but also his last. We also saw that Antony told his disciples to "Live
as though you were dying every day." 43 Athanasius reports another of
Antony's sayings: "If we live as if we were going to die each day, we will not
commit sin."-H We arc to wake up thinking it possible that we may not make
it until the evening, and go to sleep thinking that we shall not wake up.45
Epictetus had spoken along similar lines: "Let death be before your eyes every
day, and you will never have any abject thought nor excessive desire." 46
In the same vein, Marcus Aurelius wrote: "Let your every deed and word
and thought be those of one who might depart from this life this very
moment." 47 Dorotheus of Gaza also established a close link between prosocke
and the imminence of death: "Let us pay heed to ourselves, brothers, and be
vigilant while we still have time ... Look! Since the time we sat down at this
conference we have used up two or three hours of our time and got that much
nearer to death. Y ct though we see that we are losing time, we are not
afraidl"48 And again: "Let us pay heed to ourselves and be vigilant, brothers.
Who will l(ivc UK hack the present time if we w111nc it?" 4'1
132 Spiritual Exercises
Attention to the present is simultaneously control of one's thoughts,
acceptance of the divine will, and the purification of one's intentions with
regard to others. We have an excellent summary of this constant attention to
the present in a well-known Meditation of Marcus Aurelius:
Everywhere and at all times, it is up to you to rejoice piously at what is
occurring at the present moment, to conduct yourself with justice towards
the people who are present here and now, and to apply rules of
discernment [emphilotekhnein] to your present representations [phantasia1]
, so that nothing slips in that is not objcctive.50
We encounter the same continuous vigilance over both thought and
intentions in monastic spirituality, where it is transformed into the "watch of
the heart," si also known as nepsis 52 or vigilance. We are not dealing here with
a mere exercise of the moral conscience. Rather, prosoche relocates man within
his genuine being: that is, his relationship to God. It is thus equivalent to the
continuous exercise of the presence of God. In the words of Plotinus' disciple
Porphyry: "Let God be present as overseer and guardian of every action, deed
and word!" s3 Here we have one of the fundamental themes of philosophical
prosoche: presence both to God and to oneself.
"Have your joy and your rest in one thing only: in progressing from
one action done for the sake of others to another such act, always accompanied
by the remembrance of God." 5� This Meditation of Marcus Aurelius
has to do, once again, with the theme of exercises involving the presence of
God. At the same time, it introduces to us an expression which was later
to play an important role in monastic spirituality. The "remembrance of
God" is a perpetual reference to God at each instant of life. Basil of
Cacsarca links it explicitly with the "watch of the heart": "We must keep
watch over our heart with all vigilance ... to avoid ever losing the
thought of God." ss Diadochus of Photicc often evokes this theme. For him,
the remembrance of God is entirely equivalent to prosocl1e: "Only they know
their failures who never let their intellects be distracted from the remembrance
of God." 56 "Since then [i.e. since its fall], it is only with difficulty that
the human intellect can remember God and His commandments."57 We are
to
close off all the intellect's avenues of escape, by means of the remembrance
of God.58
What distinguishes a man who is virtue's friend is that he constantly
consumes everything that is earthly in his heart by means of
the remembrance of God, so that, bit by bit, the evi l in it is dispersed
by the fire of the 1·cmembrnncc of the Uood , nn<l hi11 11oul

returns in perfection to its natural brilliance; nay, even with increased
splendor.59
Clearly, remembrance of God is, in some sense, the very essence of prosoche.
It is the most radical method for ensuring one's presence to God and to
oneself.6Cl Vague intentions, however, are not sufficient for true attention to
one's self. We noted that Diadochus of Photice speaks of the "remembrance
of God and of His commandments." In ancient philosophy as well, prosoche
required meditating on and memorizing rules of life (kanones), those principles
which were to be applied in each particular circumstance, at each
moment in life. It was essential to have the principles of life, the fundamental
"dogmas," constantly "at hand."
We encounter this same theme once again in the monastic tradition. Here,
however, philosophical dogmas are replaced by the Commandments as an
evangelical rule of life, and the words of Christ, enunciating the principles of
Christian life. Yet the rule of life could be inspired not only by the evangelical
commandments, but also by the words of the "ancients;" in other words, of
the first monks. We have only to recall Antony, on his deathbed, recommending
that his disciples remember his exhortations.61 Evagrius Ponticus declares:
" It is a very nece&-sary thing ... to examine carefully the ways of the monks
who have traveled, in an earlier age, straight along the road and to direct
oneself along the same paths." 62
Both the evangelical commandments and the words of the ancients were
presented in the form of short sentences, which - just as in the philosophical
tradition - could be easily memorized and meditated upon. The numerous
collections of Apophlhegmata and of Kephalaia we find in monastic literature
are a response to this need for memorization and meditation. Apophthegmata63
were the famous sayings which the ancients - that is to say, the Desert
Fathers - pronounced in specific circumstances. This literary genre was
already in existence in the philosophical tradition, and we find numerous
examples of it in the works of Diogenes Laertius. As for Ke_phalaia,64 these
are collections of relatively short sentences, usually grouped into "centuries."
This, too, was a literary genre much in vogue in traditional philosophical
literature; some examples are Marcus Aurelius' Meditations and Porphyry's
Sentences. Both these literary genres are responses to the requirements of
meditation.
Like philosophical meditation, Christian meditation flourished by using
all available means of rhetoric and oratorical amplification, and by mobilizing
all possible resources of the imagination. Thus, for example, Evagrius
Ponticus used to invite his disciples to imagine their own death, the
decomposition of their bodies, the terrors and sufferings of their souls in Hell,
ilnd eternal fire; then, by way of contrast, they were to picture the happiness
of 1hc ju111 .M
134 Spiritual Exercises
Meditation must, in any case, be constant. Dorotheus of Gaza insists
strongly on this point:
Meditate constantly on this advice in your hearts, Brothers. Study the
words of the holy Elders.66
If we remember the sayings of the holy Elders, brothers, and meditate
on them constantly, it will be difficult for us to sin.67
If you wish to possess these sayings at the opportune moment, meditate
on them constantly.68
In the spiritual life, there is a kind of conspiracy between, on the one
hand, normative sayings, which are memorized and meditated upon, and, on
the other, the events which provide the occasion for putting them into
practice. Dorotheus of Gaza promised his monks that, if they constantly
meditated on the "works of the holy Elders," they would "be able to profit
from everything that happens to you, and to make progress by the help of
God." 69 Dorotheus no doubt meant that after such meditation, his
monks would be able to recognize the will of God in all events,
thanks to the words of the Fathers, which were likewise inspired by the will
of God.
Vigilance and self-attention clearly presuppose the practice of examining
one's conscience. We have already seen, in the case of Basil of Caesarea,711 the
close link between prosoche and the examination of conscience. It seems that
the practice of the examination of the conscience occurs for the first rime,
within the Christian tradition, in Origen 's Commentary on the Song of Songs. 71
In the course of his interpretation of verse l: 81 "Unless thou know thyself,
0 fair one among women," 72 Ori gen explains that the soul must examine its
feelings and actions. Does it have the good as a goal? Does it seek after the
various virtues? Is it making progress? For instance, has it completely
suppressed the passions of anger, sadness, fear, and love of glory? What is its
manner of giving and receiving, or of judging the truth?
This series of questions, devoid as it is of any exclusively Christian feature,
takes its place in the philosophical tradition of the examination of conscience,
as it had been recommended by the Pythagoreans, the Epicureans, the Stoics
- especially Seneca and Epictetus - and many other philosophers, such as
Plutarch and Galen.7l We find the practice recommended again by John
Chrysostom,7� and especially by Dorotheus of Gaza:
We ought not only to examine ourselves every day but also every season,
every month, and every week, and ask ourselves: "What stage nm I at
now with regards to the pm1sion by which I waN overcome luNt week ?"
Ancienl Spiritual Exercises 135
Similarly every year: "Last year I was overcome by such and such a
passion; how about now?"
The Fathers have told us how useful it is for each of us to purify
himself in tum, by examining, every evening, how we have spent the
day, and every morning, how we have spent the night .... Truly,
however, we who sin so much and are so forgetful, really need to
examine ourselves every six hours also, so that we may know how we
have spent these hours and in what way we have sinned.75
In this regard there is an interesting detail in Athanasius' Life of Antony.
According to his biographer, Antony used to recommend to his disciples that
they take written notes of the actions and movements of their souls. It is
possible that written examinations of conscience were already part of the
philosophical tradition;76 they would have been useful, if not necessary, in
order to ensure that the investigation was as precise as possible. For Antony,
however, the important aspect was the therapeutic value of writing: "Let each
one of us note and record our actions and the stirrings of our souls as though
we were going to give an account of them to each other."77 Surely, he
continues, we would not dare to commit sins in public, in full view of others:
"Let this record replace the eyes of our fellow ascetics." According to Antony,
the act of writing gives us the impression of being in public, in front of an
audience. We can also discern the therapeutic value of writing in a passage in
which Dorotheus of Gaza reports that he felt "help and relier• 78 by the mere
fact of having written to his spiritual director.
Another interesting psychological point: Plato and Zeno had remarked that
the quality of our dreams allows us to judge the spiritual state of our soul.79
We find this observation repeated by Evagrius Ponticus80 and Diadochus of
Photice.81
Finally, prosoche implies self-mastery. That is, it implies the triumph of
reason over the passions, since it is the passions that cause the distraction,
dispersion, and dissipation of the soul. Monastic literature insists tirelessly on
the misdeeds of the passions, which were often personified in demoniacal
form.
Many recollections of ancient philosophy were preserved in monastic
exercises of self-mastery. For instance, we find Dorotheus of Gaza, like
Epictetus, advising his disciples to begin by training themselves in little
th,ings, so as to create a habit,82 before moving on to greater things. Similarly,
he advises them to diminish the number of their sins bit by bit, in order to
defeat a passion.u We find Evagrius Ponticus proposing that one passion
ought to be combated by means of another - fornication, for instance, by the
concern for one's good reputation - as long as it remains impossible to combat
the passion directly by the virtue which is opposed to it. This was the method
already KUl(Ke11tcJ by Cicero in hiK 1i11rn/a11 Disp"tations.84
136 Spiritual Exercises
We said above that Christianity's acceptance of spiritual exercises had
introduced into it a certain spiritual attitude and style of life which it had
previously lacked. As an example, let us consider the concept of exercises as
a whole. In the very process of performing repetitious actions and undergoing
a training in order to modify and transform ourselves, there is a certain
reflectivity and distance which is very different from evangelical spontaneity.
Attention to oneself - the essence of prosoche - gives rises to a whole series of
techniques of introspection. It engenders an extraordinary finesse in the
examination of conscience and spiritual discernment. Most significantly, the
ideal sought after in these exercises, and the goals proposed for the spiritual
life, became tinged with a strong Stoico-Platonic coloration; that is to say,
since by the end of antiquity Neoplatonism had integrated Stoic ethics within
itself, that they were deeply infused with Neoplatonism. This is the case, for
instance, in Dorotheus of Gaza, who describes spiritual perfection in completely
Stoic terms: it is the transformation of the will so that it becomes
identified with the Divine Will:
He who has no will of his own always does what he wishes. For since
he has no will of his own, everything that happens satisfies him. He
finds himself doing as he wills all the time, for he does not want things
to be as he wills them, but he wills that they be just as they arc.85
The most recent editors of Dorotheus compare this text with a passage from
the Manual of Epictetus: "Do not seek to have everything that happens
happen as you wish, but wish for everything to happen as it actually does
happen, and your life will be serene." Rb
Spiritual perfection is also depicted as apalheia - the complete absence of
passions - a Stoic concept taken up by Ncoplatonism. For Dorotheus of Gaza,
apatheia is the end-result of the annihilation of one's own will: "From this
cutting off of self-will a man procures for himself detachment [aprospatheia],
and from detachment he comes, with the help of God, to perfect apatheia." R7
We may note in passing that the means Dorotheus recommends for cutting
off self-will are wholly identical to the exercises of self-mastery of the
philosophical tradition. In order to cure curiosity, for instance, Plutarch
advised people not to read funeral epitaphs, not to snoop on their neighbors,
and to turn their backs on street scenes.RR Similarly, Dorotheus advises us not
to look in the direction where we want to look; not to ask the cook what he's
preparing for dinner; and not to join in a conversation we find already
underway.89 This is what Dorotheus means by "cutting off self-will."
It is with Evagrius, however, that we can see most clearly just how closely
Christian apatheia can be linked to philosophical concepts. In Evagrius'
Praktikos, we find the following definition: "The K inicdom of Heaven is
apalheia of the soul along with true knowlcd1o1c of c1d111 in1o1 1 hi n1i111. '""1 When
Ancient Spiritual Exercises 1 37
we turn to comment on a formula such as this, we find how great is the
distance separating such speculations from the evangelical spir)t. As we know,
the evangelical message consisted in the announcement of an eschatological
event called "the Kingdom of Heaven" or "the Kingdom of God." Evagrius
begins by differentiating between the two expressions, and interpreting them
in a highly personal way. Enlarging upon the Origenist tradition,91 he
considers that the two expressions designate two inner states of the soul. More
precisely, they designate two stages of spiritual progress:
The Kingdom of Heaven is apatheia of the soul along with true
knowledge of existing things.
The Kingdom of God is knowledge of the Holy Trinity co-extensive
with the capacity of the intelligence and giving it a surpassing incorruptibility
.92
Two levels of knowledge are distinguished here: the knowledge of beings and
the knowledge of God. We then realize that this distinction corresponds
exactly to a division of the parts of philosophy which was well known to
Origen, and is attested in Platonism at least since the time of Plutarch.93 In
chis division, three separate stages or levels of spiritual progress are distinguished,
which correspond to the three parts of philosophy: ethics - or
"practics,'' as Evagrius calls it - physics, and theology. Ethics corresponds to
initial purification, physics to definitive detachment from the sensible world
and contemplation of the order of nature; finally, theology corresponds to
contemplation of the principle of all things. According to the Evagrian
schema, however, ethics corresponds to praktike, physics to "the Kingdom of
Heaven," which includes the true knowledge of beings, and theology corresponds
to "the Kingdom of God," which is the knowledge of the Trinity. In
Neoplatonic systematization, these degrees also correspond to degrees of
virtue. According to Porphyry,94 the soul begins by utilizing the political
virtues to dominate the passions via the state of metriopatheia. It then rises to
the level of the kathartic virtues. These virtues begin to detach the soul from
the body, but do not yet do so completely; this is only the beginning of
apatheia. Not until the level of the theoretical virtues does the soul attain to
full apatheia and perfect separation from the body. It is at this level that the
soul is able to contemplate the forms within the divine intellect, which are the
moqels for the phenomenal world.95 This level, characterized by apatheia
and the contemplation of existents, corresponds to Evagrius' "Kingdom
of Heaven." According to Evagrius, the soul now contemplates the
multiplicity of physeis ("natures"; hence the denomination "physical"): on the
one hand, the intelligible forms, and on the other the logoi of sensible
bcings.''6 The final stage, noetic in nature, is the contemplation of God
llim11c:lf. Thu11, Ev11griu11 !IUm11 up his thought in these terms: "Christianity is
1 38 Spiritual Exercises
the doctrine of Christ our Savior. It is composed of praktike, of physics, and
of theology." 97
Apatheia plays an essential role, not only in theoretical constructions such
as Evagrian metaphysics, but also in monastic spirituality. There, its value is
closely linked to that of peace of mind and absence of worry: amerimnia98 or
tranqui/litas.99 Dorotheus of Gaza100 does not hesitate to declare that peace of
mind is so important that one must, if necessary, drop what one has
undertaken if one's peace of mind is endangered. Peace of mind - tranquillitas
animi - had, moreover, always been a central value within the philosophical
tradition.101
For Porphyry, as we have seen, apatlreia was a result of the soul's
detachment from the body. Here we touch once again upon the philosophical
exercise par excellence. As we saw above, Plato had declared: "those who go
about philosophizing correctly are in training for death." 102 As late as the
seventh century, we still find the echo of this saying in Maximus Confessor:
"In conformity with the philosophy of Christ, let us make of our life a
training for death." ioJ
Yet Maximus himself is only the inheritor of a rich tradition, which
repeatedly identified Christian philosophy with training for death. We encounter
this theme already in Clement of Alexandria, 1114 who understood such
training in a thoroughly Platonic sense, as the attempt spiritually to separate
the soul from the body. For Clement, perfect knowledge, or gnosis, is a kind
of death. It separates the soul from the body, and promotes the soul to a life
entirely devoted to the good, allowing it to devote itself to the contemplation
of genuine realities with a purified mind. Again, the same motif recurs in
Gregory Nazianzen: "Make of this life, as Plato said, a training for death, while
- to speak in his terms - separating the soul from the body as far as
possible." 105 "This," he tells us, "is the practice of philosophy." Evagrius, for
his part, expresses himself in terms strikingly similar to Porphyry's:
To separate the body from the soul is the privilege only of Him who
has joined them together. But to separate the soul from the body lies as
well in the power of the person who pursues virtue. For our Fathers
gave to the training for death and to the flight from the body a special
name: anachoresis [i.e. the monastic life ]. 106
It is easy to see that the Platonic concept of the flight from the body, which
exercised such an attraction upon the young Augustine, was an element added 0'1
to Christianity, and not essential to it. Nevertheless, this concept determined the
orientation of the whole of Christian spirituality in a quite specific direction.
So far, we have noted the permanent survival of certain philosophical spiritual
exercises in Christianity and mono11tici11m, nnd we hnvc tried to make
Ancient Spiritual Exercises 1 39
comprehensible the particular tonality that their reception introduced into
Christianity. We must not, however, exaggerate the i"'l>ortance of this
phenomenon. In the first place, as we have said, it manifested itself only in a
rather restricted circle: among Christian writers who had received a philosophical
education. Even in their case, however, the final synthesis is essentially
Christian.
To be sure, our authors strove to Christianize their borrowings as much as
possible; but this is perhaps the least important aspect of the matter. They
believed they recognized spiritual exercises, which they had learned through
philosophy, in specific scriptural passages. Thus, we saw Basil of Caesarea
making a connection between prosoche and a text from Deuteronomy . 107 Then,
in Athanasius' Life of Antony, and throughout monastic literature, prosoche
was transformed into the "watch of the heart," under the influence of
Proverbs, 4:23: "Above all else, guard your heart." 1118 Examination of one's
conscience was often justified by the Second Letter to the Corinthians, 13:5:
"Examine yourselves . . . and test yourselves." 109 Finally, the meditation on
death was recommended on the basis of First Corinthians, 1 5: 31: "I die every
day." uo
Nevertheless, it would be a mistake to believe that these references were
enough, all by themselves, to Christianize spiritual exercises. The reason why
Christian authors paid attention to these particular biblical passages was that
they were already familiar, from other sources, with the spiritual exercises of
prosoche, meditation on death, and examination of the conscience. By themselves,
the texts from scripture could never have supplied a method for
practicing these exercises. Often, in fact, a given scriptural passage has only
a distant connection with a particular spiritual exercise.
More important is the overall spirit in which Christian and monastic
spiritual exercises were practiced. They always presupposed the assistance of
God's grace, and they made of humility the most important of virtues. In the
words of Dorotheus of Gaza: "The closer one comes to God, the more one
sees oneself as a sinner." 1 1
1 Such humility makes us consider ourselves
inferior to others. It leads us to maintain the greatest reserve in both conduct
and speech, and to adopt certain significant bodily positions, for instance
prostration before other monks.
Two .other fundamental virtues were penitence and obedience. Penitence,
inspired by the fear and love of God, could take the form of extremely severe
self-mortification. The remembrance of death was intended not only to make
people realize the urgency of conversion, but also to develop the fear of God.
In turn, it is linked to meditation on the Last Judgment, and thereby to the
virtue of penitence. The same holds true of the examination of conscience.
Obedience - the renunciation of one's own will, in complete submission to
the orders of o superior - completely transformed the philosophical practice
of s1>irilual direclion. We can Nee 10 juHI what extremes such obedience could
140 Spiritual Exercises
be taken in Dorotheus' Life of Dositheus. 112 The director of conscience had an
absolute power of decision over his disciple's possessions, eating habits, and
entire way of life.
In the final analysis, all these virtues were transfigured by the transcendent
dimension of the love of God and of Christ. Thus, to train for death, or to
separate the soul from the body, was at the same time to participate in the
death of Christ. To renounce one's will was to adhere to divine love.
Generally speaking, we can say that monasticism in Egypt and Syriam was
born and developed in a Christian milieu, spontaneously and without the
intervention of a philosophical model. The first monks were not cultivated
men, but Christians who wanted to attain to Christian perfection by the
heroic practice of the evangelical prescriptions, and the imitation of the Life
of Christ. It was, therefore, natural that they should seek their techniques of
perfection in the Old and the New Testament. Under Alexandrian influence,
however - the distant influence of Philo, and the more immediate influence
of Origen and Clement of Alexandria, magnificently orchestrated by the
Cappadocians - certain philosophical spiritual techniques were introduced
into Christian spirituality. The result of this was that the Christian ideal was
described, and, in part, practiced, by borrowing models and vocabulary from
the Greek philosophical tradition. Thanks to its literary and philosophical
qualities, this tendency became dominant, and it was through its agency that
the heritage of ancient spiritual exercises was transmitted to Christian
spirituality: first to that of the Middle Ages, and subsequently to that of
modern times.

Figures

The Figure of Socrates
Since the dawn of Greek thought, the sage has functioned as a living, concrete
model. Aristotle testifies to this in a passage from his Protrepticus: "What more
accurate standard or measure of good things do we have than the Sage?" 1
There were several reasons for the fact that my research on the sage as a model
gradually became fixed upon Socrates. In the first place, I found in him a
figure who had exercised a widespread influence of the greatest importance on
the entire Western tradition. Secondly, and most importantly, the figure of
Socrates - as sketched by Plato, at any rate - had, it seemed to me, one unique
advantage. It is the portrait of a mediator between the transcendent ideal of
wisdom and concrete human reality. It is a paradox of highly Socratic irony
that Socrates was not a sage, but a "philo-sopher": that is, a lover of wisdom.
To speak about Socrates is, of course, to expose oneself to all sorts of
historical difficulties. The accounts we have of him by Plato and by
Xenophon have transformed, idealized, and deformed the historical Socrates.2
I shall not attempt here to uncover or reconstruct the historical Socrates.
Instead, what I shall try to set forth is the figure of Socrates, as it has
influenced our Western tradition. Since this is a phenomenon of immense
proportions, however, I shall restrict myself to two of its aspects: the figure
of Socrates as depicted in Plato's Symposium, and as it was perceived by those
two great Socratics, Kierkegaard3 and Nietzsche. 4
1 Silenus
Socrates thus functions as a mediator between ideal norms and human reality.
The concepts of "mediation" and "intermediate" call to mind the ideas of
equilibrium and the Golden Mean. We should therefore expect to see in
Socrates a harmonious figure, combining divine and human characteristics in
llcl icutc nu1mccN.
148 Figures
Nothing could be further from the truth. The figure of Socrates is
ambiguous, troubling, and strangely disconcerting. The first surprise in store
for us is his physical ugliness, which is well attested by the testimony of Plato,
Xenophon, and Aristophanes.5 "It is significant," wrote Nietzsche, "that
Socrates was the first great Hellene to be ugly." 6 "Everything in him is
exaggerated, bujfo, a caricature." 7 Nietzsche goes on to evoke his "crab-like
eyes, puffed-up lips, and hanging belly," 8 and he takes pleasure in telling the
story of how the physiognomist Zopyrus once told Socrates he was a monster,
keeping hidden within himself the worst vices and appetites. Socrates, says
Nietzsche, simply replied: "How well you know me!"9 If Socrates really did
resemble a Silenus, as he is depicted in Plato's Symposium,10 such suspicions
were quite understandable. In popular imagination, Sileni and satyrs were
hybrid demons, half-animal, half-men, who made up the escort of Dionysos.
These impudent, ribald buffoons also constituted the chorus of satyr-plays, a
literary genre of which Euripides' Cyclops is one of the few remaining
examples.
The Sileni were purely natural beings. They stood for the negation of
culture and civilization, for grotesque buffoonery, and for the license of the
instincts. 11
To use Kierkegaard's expression, Socrates was a cobold. 12 To be sure, Plato
gives us to understand that Socrates' resemblance to Silenus was only an
appearance, beneath which something else was hidden. Alcibiades, in his
famous speech in praise of Socrates at the end of the Symposium, 1 .i compares
Socrates to the little statues of Sileni that could be found in sculptors' shops,
which concealed little figurines of the gods inside themselves. Similarly,
Socrates' exterior appearance - ugly, buffoon-like, impudent, almost monstrous
- was only a mask and a facade.
Here we are led to another paradox: Socrates was not only ugly, but a
dissimulator as well. Nietzsche writes: "Everything in him is concealed,
ulterior, subterranean." 14 Socrates masks himself, and at the same time is used
as a mask by others.
Socrates masks himself: here we encounter that famous Socratic irony, the
meaning of which we shall have to clarify later on. Socrates pretends to be
ignorant and impudent. "He spends his whole life," says Alcibiades, "playing
the part of a simpleton and a child." i; "The nouns and verbs which form the
outer envelope of his words arc like the hide of an impudent satyr. "11' His
ignorant appearance and amorous attentions "are what he has wrapped around
himself, like a carved Silenus." 17
Socrates pulled off his enterprise of dissimulation so well that he succeeded
in definitively masking himself from history. He wrote nothing, engaging only
in dialogue. All the testimonies we possess about him hide him from us more
than they reveal him, precisely because Socrates hns nlwnyN been UNed 11s n
mask by those who have spoken nhoul him.
The Figure of Socrates 149
Because he was himself masked, Socrates became the prosopon, or mask, of
personalities who felt the need to take shelter behind hinl. It was from him
that they got the idea both to mask themselves, and to u�e Socratic irony as
a mask. We have here a phenomenon extremely rich in its literary, pedagogical,
and psychological implications.
The original nucleus of this phenomenon was the irony of Socrates himself.
Socrates, the eternal interrogator, used skillful questions to bring his interlocutors
to admit their ignorance. By so doing, he disturbed them so much
that they were eventually led to question their entire lives. After Socrates'
death, the memory of his Socratic conversations inspired a new literary genre,
the logoi sokratikoi, which imitated the conversations Socrates had had with a
wide variety of interlocutors. In these logoi sokratikoi, Socrates became a
prosopon - an interlocutor or character - and hence, if we recall the meaning
of prosopon in the ancient theater, a mask. Especially in the subtle, refined
form given it by Plato, the Socratic dialogue was intended to provoke in its
readers an effect analogous to that produced by the living discourse of
Socrates himself. Thus, the reader of these dialogues finds himself in the same
situation as Socrates' interlocutors: he does not know w�ere Socrates'
questions are going to lead him. Socrates' elusive, unsettling prosopon/mask
sows disquiet in the soul of the reader, leading it to a heightening of
consciousness which may go as far as far as a philosophical conversion. As
Konrad Gaiser has convincingly shown,'8 the reader himself is invited to take
refuge behind the mask of Socrates. In almost all Plato's Socratic dialogues,
there comes a moment of crisis, when the interlocutors are overcome by
discouragement. They no longer have confidence in the possibility of
continuing the discussion, and it seems as though the dialogue is about to be
broken off. This is where Socrates intervenes: he takes the others' doubt,
uneasiness, and discouragement upon himself. He assumes all the risks of the
dialectical adventure, and carries out a complete switching of roles. If the
enterprise fails, it will henceforth be his responsibility. In this way, he shows
his interlocutors a projection of their own selves. They can now transfer their
personal uneasiness onto Socrates, and regain confidence in dialectical
research and in the logos itself.
In his dialogues, Plato too uses Socrates as a mask, or, in Nietzsche's
terminology, as a "semiotics." 19 As Paul Friedlander2° has pointed out,
whereas the "ego" had long since made its appearance in Greek literature -
,Hesiod, Xenophanes, Parmenides, Empedocles, the Sophists, and even Xenophon
do not hesitate to speak in the first person - Plato completely effaces
himself behind Socrates in his dialogues, and systematically avoids the use of
the first person singular . We arc deal ing here with an cxlrcmcly subtle
relatinnNhip, whose significance is extremely h1ml lo M"f11Np. Arc we to

for members of the Academy, and his written dialogues, in which he utilized
the mask of Socrates to exhort his readers to philosophy? Alternatively,
should we conclude that Plato uses the figure of Socrates to set forth his
doctrines with a certain degree of distance and irony? In any case, this initial
situation has indelibly influenced Western consciousness. Whenever thinkers
have been aware of - and frightened by - the radical renewal of which they
were the bearers, they too have used a mask to confront their contemporaries.
They have usually chosen to use the ironic mask of Socrates.
When, in the nineteenth century, j.G. Hamann praised Socrates in his
Socratic Memorabilia, he did so, to use his own term, to mimike. 22 In other
words, Hamann himself took up the mask of Socrates - the rationalist par
excellence in the eyes of the eighteenth ccntury21 - in order to make people
see, behind the mask, a figure prophetic of Christ.
What, for Hamann, was only a temporary expedient became a fundamental,
existential attitude for Kierkegaard. Kierkegaard's penchant for masks is most
evident in his use of pseudonyms. As is well known, most of Kierkegaard's
works were first published under a variety of pseudonyms: Victor Eremita,
Johannes Oimacus, etc. W c are not dealing here with an editorial caprice.
Rather, for Kierkegaard, all these pseudonyms correspond to different levels
- the "aesthetic," "ethical," and "religious" - at which the author was
supposed to be situated. Kierkegaard speaks successively of Christianity as an
aesthete, then as a moralist, in order to force his contemporaries into the
awareness that they are not true Christians. "He hid himself beneath the mask
of an artist and half-believing moralist to speak about what he believed most
deeply." 24
Kierkegaard was perfectly aware of the Socratic character of his method:
From the point of view of my whole activity as an author, integrally
conceived, the aesthetic work is a deception, and herein is to be found
the deeper significance of the use of pseudonyms. A deception, however,
is a rather ugly thing. To this I would make answer: One must not let
oneself be deceived by the word "deception." One can deceive a person
for the truth's sake, and (to recall old Socrates) one can deceive a person
into the truth. Indeed, it is only by this means, i.e. by deceiving him,
that it is possible to bring into the truth one who is in an illusion.25
Kierkegaard's goal was to make the reader aware of his mistakes, not by
directly refuting them, but by setting them forth in such a way that their
absurdity would become clearly apparent. This is as Socratic as can be. At the
same time, Kierkegaard used pseudonymy to give voice to all the different
characters within him. In the process, he objectified his various selves,
without recognizing himself in any of them, just ns Socrates, by means of hiN
skillful questions, objectified the self of hii; intc1·locutor11 wit hout recol(nizinl(

himself in any of them. Thus we find Kierkegaard writing: "Because of my
melancholy, it was years before I was able to say 'thou' to �yself. Between
my melancholy and my 'thou,' there was a whole world of fantasy. I exhausted
it, in part, in my pseudonyms." 26 Yet Kierkegaard was not content to mask
himself behind pseudonyms. His real mask was Socratic irony itself; it was
Socrates himself: "0 Socrates! Yours and mine are the same adventure! I am
alone. My only analogy is Socrates. My task is a Socratic task." 27
Kierkegaard termed this Socratic method his "method of indirect communication."
28 We encounter it once again in Nietzsche, for whom it is the
method of the great educator: "An educator never says what he himself
thinks, but always only what he thinks of a thing in relation to the
requirements of those he educates. He must not be detected in this dissimulation."
29 This method is justified by the educator's transcendent mission:
"Every profound spirit needs a mask; better yet, around every profound spirit
a mask is continually growing, thanks to the constantly false - that is to say,
superficial - interpretation of his every word, step, and manifestation of
life."JO The mask of the Socratic Silenus served as the model for Nietzsche's
theory of the mask. As he wrote in the unpublished writings of the last period
of his life:
I believe that this was the magic of Socrates: he had one soul, and
another one in behind it, and behind it still another one. It was in the
first one that Xenophon lay down to sleep; in the second, Plato; and in
the third one Plato again, but this time Plato with his own second soul.
Plato himself is a man with many a hidden cave behind and facades out
front.31
As for Kierkegaard, so for Nietzsche: masks were a pedagogical necessity,
but also a psychological need. Nietzsche himself could be included in his
category of "men who want only to be seen shining through others. And
there's a lot of wisdom in this." 32 In his Ecce Homo,-13 Nietzsche himself
admits that he used his masters Schopenhauer and Wagner as masks in
writing his Untimely Meditations, just as Plato had used Socrates as a
"semiotics." There is indeed a relationship comparable to that between Plato
and Socrates here: Nietzsche was speaking of an ideal Wagner and an ideal
Schopenhauer, who were really nothing other than Nietzsche himself. As
Bertram34 has convincingly shown, one of Nietzsche's masks was certainly
Socrates himself; Socrates, whom he pursued with the same amorous hatred
that Nietzsche feels for Nietzsche; that same Socrates who, he tells us, "is so
close to me, that I am almost always fighting with him." 35 The side of
SocmteH Nietzsche hates is identical with the Nietzsche who dissolves myths,
rcplndng the l(od11 by the knowledge of good and evil; the Nietzsche who

1 52 Figures
Socrates which Nietzsche loves, and of which he is jealous, is what he himself
would like to be: the seducer, the educator, and the guide of souls. We shall
have occasion to return to this amorous hatred.
The Socratic mask is the mask of irony. If we examine the texts - by Plato,36
Aristotle,37 or Theophrastus38 - in which the word eironeia appears, we can
conclude that irony is a psychological attitude in which the individual uses
self-deprecation in an attempt to appear inferior to what he really is. In the
art and usage of discourse, it takes the form of pretending to concede that
one's interlocutor is right, and to adopt the point of view of one's adversary.
The rhetorical figure of eironeia, then, consists in using words or speeches
which the audience would rather have expected to hear coming from the
mouth of one's adversary.39 This is certainly the form assumed by Socratic
irony. In the words of Cicero: "By disparaging himself, Socrates used to
concede more than was necessary to the adversaries he wanted to refute.
Thus, thinking one thing and saying another, he enjoyed using the kind of
dissimulation which the Greeks call 'irony'." 40 Socratic irony is thus a feigned
self-deprecation, which consists primarily in passing oneself off as someone
completely ordinary and superficial. As Alcibiades puts it in his praise of
Socrates:
His speech is for all the world like those Sileni that open up down the
middle. When you listen to it for the first time, you just can't help
finding it absolutely ridiculous. He talks about pack asses and blacksmiths
and shoemakers and tanners, and he always seems to be repeating
the same thing, so that anyone who wasn't used to his style and wasn't
very quick on the uptake would naturally take it for the most utter
nonsense.41
Not only was Socrates guilty of banality in the subjects he discussed, but
his interlocutors were banal, as well. He sought out and found his audience
in the marketplace, the gymnasia, artists' workshops, and shops. He was a
street person. In the words of Nietzsche: "Mediocrity is the most appropriate
mask the superior spirit can wear." 42 Socrates talked and debated, but he
refused to be considered a master. "When people came to sec him," remarks
Epictetus, "and asked him to introduce them to other philosophers, he
complied readily, and willingly accepted to pass unnoticed himself. " 43
Here we touch the heart of Socratic irony: if Socrates refused to teach or
be considered a master, it was because he had nothing to say or to
communicate, for the excellent reason that, as he frequently proclaimed, he
did not know anything. Since he had nothing to say, and no thesis to defend,
all Socrates could do was to ask questions, even thoul(h he himself refused to
answer them. In the first book of the Repu/Jlir, ThrR11ymRcllllt1 cries out : "Y c
gods! Herc we have the well-known rirm1ri11 of Sorn11l•111 "till I k nrw ii und
The Figure of Socrates 1 53
predicted that when it came to replying you would refuse and dissemble and
do anything rather than answer any question that anyo\le asked you." 44
Aristotle described the situation even more clearly: "Socrates used to ask
questions and not answer them - for he used to confess that he did not
know." 45
Obviously, we cannot know exactly how Socrates' discussions with the
Athenians took place. Plato's dialogues - even the most "Socratic" - are only
a doubly weak imitation of them. In the first place, they are not spoken, but
written, and, as Hegel remarked, "in printed dialogue, answers are altogether
under the author's control; but to say that in actual life people are found to
answer as they arc here made to do, is quite another thing."46 Moreover,
beneath the surface charm of literary fiction, we can recognize in Plato's
dialogues the trace of the scholastic exercises of the Platonic Academy.
Aristotle codified the rules of these dialectical jousts in his Topics.41 There were
well-defined roles for both questioner and respondent in these argumentation
exercises, and the rules of this intellectual fencing were rigorously defined.
It is not our task here to try to disentangle what may be properly "Socratic"
in the conversations reported by Plato; rather, we arc concerned to uncover
the significance of Socratic irony as it was known to tradition, and the
movements of consciousness to which it corresponds.
Otto Apelt48 has given a good description of the mechanism of Socratic
irony: Spa/tung und Verdoppelung.49 Socrates splits himself into two, so that
there are two Socrates: the Socrates who knows in advance how the discussion
is going to end, and the Socrates who travels the entire dialectical path along
with his interlocutor. Socrates' interlocutors do not know where he is leading
them, and therein lies the irony. As he travels the path along with his
interlocutors, Socrates constantly demands total agreement from them. He
takes his partner's position as his starting point, and gradually makes him
admit all the consequences of his position. This a priori agreement is founded
on the rational demands of the Logos,50 or reasonable discourse. By constantly
demanding assent, Socrates leads his interlocutor to recognize that his initial
position was contradictory, and he thereby objectifies their common undertaking.
As a rule, Socrates chooses an activity familiar to his interlocutor as
the subject of discussion, and tries to define, together with him, the practical
knowledge required to carry out this activity. For example, a general must
know how to fight bravely, and a soothsayer must behave piously towards the
go<Js. At the end of the road, however, the general turns out to have no idea
of what courage really is, and the soothsayer docsn 't know what piety is. It is
t hen that the interlocutor rcali7..cs that he doesn't really know the reasons
for hiH actions. Suddenly, his whole value-system seems to him without
foundat ion. Up unt il then, he had, to a certain extent, identified with the
v11luc..'-NYNtcm which hnd dictated to him his way of thinking and speaking.
l lt·m�cfort h, tu� i11 op1m11cd to it.
1 54 Figures
Thus, the interlocutor, too, is cut in two: there is the interlocutor as he was
before his conversation with Socrates, and there is the interlocutor who, in the
course of their constant mutual accord, has identified himself with Socrates,
and who henceforth will never be the same again.
The absolutely essential point in this ironical method is the path which
Socrates and his interlocutor travel together. Socrates pretends he wants to
learn something from his interlocutor, and this constitutes his ironic selfdeprecation.
In fact, however, even while Socrates appears ro identify himself
with the interlocutor, and enter completely into his· discourse, in the last
analysis it is the interlocutor who unconsciously enters into Socrates' discourse
and identifies himself with him. Let us not forget: to identify oneself
with Socrates is to identify oneself with aporia and doubt, for Socrates doesn't
know anything; all he knows is that he knows nothing. Therefore, at the end
of the discussion, the interlocutor has not learned anything; in fact, he no
longer even knows anything. And yet, throughout the duration of the
discussion, he has experienced what true activity of the mind is. Better yet,
he has been Socrates himself. And Socrates is interrogation, questioning, and
stepping back to take a look at oneself; in a word, he is consciousness.
Such is the profound meaning of Socratic maieutics. In a famous passage
of the Theaetetus,51 Socrates tells how he practices the same trade as did his
mother, who was a midwife, attending corporeal births. Socrates himself, he
claims, is a midwife of the mind, and it is to the birth of minds that he
attends. Socrates himself does not engender anything, since he knows
nothing; he merely helps others to engender themselves. As Kierkegaard was
well aware, Socratic maieutics stands the master-disciple relationship on its
head:
to be a teacher does not mean simply to affirm that such a thing is so,
or to deliver a lecture, & etc. No, to be a teacher in the right sense is to
be a learner. Instruction begins when you, the teacher, learn from the
learner, put yourself in his place so that you may understand what he
understands and in the way he understands it. 52
The disciple is the opportunity for the master to understand himself, as
the master is the opportunity for the disciple to understand himself.
When he dies, the master has no claim on the disciple's soul, no more
than the disciple has on that of the master ... The best way to
understand Socrates is precisely to understand that we do not owe him
anything. That is what Socrates preferred, and it is good that he was
able to prefer this. 53
Here we touch upon one of the possible rncnningN of Socratcfi' cnigmatk
declaration: "I only know one t hing: th111 iM, 1 h111 I llun'I know 11ny1 him(. " 1•
The Figure of Socrates 1 55
This statement could be interpreted as meaning that Socrates did not possess
any transmissible knowledge, and was unable to cause ideas to pass from his
mind into that of others. As Socrates is made to say in Plato's Symposium, "My
dear Agathon . . . I only wish that wisdom were the kind of thing that flowed
... from the vessel that was full to the one that was empty." 55
In Xenophon's Memoirs of Socrates, Hippias tells Socrates that, instead of
always asking questions about justice, he would do better simply to say, once
and for all, whar justice is. Socrates replies: "If I don't reveal my views on
justice in words, I do so by my conduct." 56 To be sure, Socrates was a
passionate lover of words and dialogue. With just as much passion, however,
he sought to demonstrate to us the limits of language. What he wanted to
show us is that we can never understand justice if we do not live it. Justice,
like every authentic reality, is indefinable, and this is what Socrates sought to
make his interlocutor understand, in order to urge him to "live" justice. The
questioning of discourse leads to the questioning of the individual, who must
decide whether or not he will resolve to live according to his conscience and
to reason. In the words of one of Socrates' interlocutors: "Anyone who enters
into conversation with Socrates is liable to be drawn into an argument, and
whatever subject he may start, he will be continually carried round and round
by him, until at last he finds that he has to give an account both of his present
and past life." 57 The individual thus finds himself called into question in the
most fundamental bases of his action, and he becomes aware of the living
problem he himself represents for himself. All values are consequently turned
upside down, as is the importance previously accorded them. As Socrates says
in Plato's Apology:
I care nothing for what most people care about: money-making,
administration of property, generalships, success in public debates,
magistracies, coalitions, and political factions . . . I did not choose that
path, but rather the one by which I could do the greatest good to each
of you in particular: by trying to persuade each of you to concern
himself less about what he has that about what he is, so that he may
make himself as good and as reasonable as possible. 58
The Socratic enterprise is existential in that it appeals to the individual.
This is why Nietzsche and Kierkegaard, each in his own way, tried to repeat
it .. In the following text by Nietzsche, where he describes the "Schopenhauerian
man," isolated in the midst of his contemporaries, it is hard not to think
of Socrates' constant appeal to "take care of yourself," 59 and his continual
calling into question of the individual:
hiN fellow men , , . 11trut about in a hundred masquerades, as youths, old
men, liu herN, cit iienN, 1nic11t 11, oflki11IN, merchants, mindful solely of
1 56 Figures
their comedy and not at all of themselves. To the question: "To what
end do you live?" they would all quickly reply with pride: "To become
a good citizen, or scholar, or statesmanl" 60
the objective of all human arrangements is through distracting one's
thoughts to cease to be aware of life.61
Haste is universal because everyone is in flight from himself.62
Already in Plato's Symposium, Alcibiades had said: "Socrates makes me admit
to myself that, even though I myself am deficient in so many regards, I
continue to take no care for myself, but occupy myself with the business of
the Athenians." 113 This passage allows us to glimpse the political consequences
of such a reversal of values and upending of the guiding norms of life.
Concern for one's individual destiny cannot help but lead to conflict with
the state. 64 This is the deepest meaning of the trial and death of Socrates.
Socratic irony becomes especially dramatic when, thanks to the evidence of
Plato's Apology of Socrates, we sec it being used at the expense of the
philosopher's accusers, and, in a sense, bringing about his condemnation to
death.M
Here we have an instance of the "seriousness of existence" of which
Kierkegaard speaks."" For Kierkegaard, Socrates' merit was that he was an
exis1i11g thinker, not a speculative philosopher who has forgotten what it
means to exist. Kierkegaard's fundamental category of existence is the
individual, or the unique, isolated in the solitude of his existential responsibility.
For Kierkegaard, Socrates was its discoverer.1'7
Here we come upon one of the most profound reasons for Socratic irony:
direct language is not adequate for communicating the experience of existing,
the authentic consciousness of being, the seriousness of life as we live it, or
the solitude of decision making. To speak is to be doubly condemned to
banality. In the first place, there can be no direct communication of existential
experience, and in this sense, every speech-act is "banal." Secondly, however,
it is this same banality which, in the form of irony, can make indirect
communication possible.611 In the words of Nietzsche: "I believe I sense that
Socrates was profound; his irony was above all the necessity to pass himself
off as superficial, in order to be able to associate with people at all." 69 For the
existential thinker, banality and superficiality are a vital necessity. The
existentialist must remain in contact with mankind, even if the latter is at a
level of less-than-adequate consciousness. At the same time, however, we have
here to do with a pedagogical artifice. The circuitous detours of irony, and
the shock of aporit1, can cause the reader to attnin 10 the seriousness of
existential consciousness, especially if, 1ts we sh11ll 11cc l111c1", 1·hc power of l•:ros
is thrown in for icood measure.
The Figure o/Socrates 1 57
Socrates had no system to teach. Throughout, his philosophy was a
spiritual exercise, an invitation to a new way of life, active reflection, and
living consciousness.
Perhaps the Socratic formula: "I know that I know nothing" ought to be
given a deeper meaning. We are thus brought back to our starting point:
Socrates knows that he is not a sage.70 As an individual, his conscience was
aroused and spurred on by this feeling of imperfection and incompleteness.
In this regard, Kierkegaard can help us to understand the significance of
the figure of Socrates. Kierkegaard asserts that he knows only one thing: that
he is not a Christian. He was intimately convinced of this fact, because to be
a Christian is to have a genuine personal and existential relationship with
Christ; it is to intcriorize Christ in a decision emanating from the depths of
the self. Since such interiorization is so very difficult, it is virtually impossible
for anyone truly to be a Christian. The only true Christian was Christ. At any
rate, the least we can say is that the best Christian is he who is aware of not
being a Christian, insofar as he recognizes that he is not a Christian.71
Like every existential consciousness, Kierkegaard's was divided. It existed
only in its consciousness of not truly existing. Kierkegaardian consciousness
is identical to Socratic consciousness:
0 Socrates, you had the accursed advantage of making it painfully
obvious, by means of your ignorance, that others were even less wise
than you. They didn't even know that they were ignorant. Your
adventure was the same as mine. People become exasperated with me
when they sec that I can show that others are even less Christian than
I; I who respect Christianity so much that I see and admit that I am not
a Christian!72
Socratic consciousness is also torn and divided: not by the figure of Christ,
but by the transcendent norm of the figure of the sage.
justice, as we have seen, cannot be defined. It must be lived. All the human
discourse in the world could never suffice to express the depth of one person's
resolution to be just. All human decisions arc, howc�er, fragile and precarious.
When a person chooses to be just in the context of a particular act, he has the
inkling of an existence which could be just in the full sense of the term. Such
a fully just existence is that of the sage, who is not sop/10s, but philo-sophos: not
a wise man, but one who desires wisdom, precisely because he lacks it. Paul
Friedlander puts it well: "Socratic irony, at its center, expresses the tension
between ignorance - that is, the impossibility ultimately to put into words
'what justice is' - and the direct experience of the unknown, the existence of
the just man, whom justice raises to the level of the divine." 73

being wise. An immense desire arises from such an awareness of privation,
and this is why, for Western consciousness, Socrates the philosopher takes on
the features of Eros, the eternal vagabond in search of true beauty.
2 Eros
It could be said that Socrates was the first individual in the history of Western
thought. Werner Jaeger,. was right to point out that Plato and Xenophon, in
their Socratic writings, strive to make the reader sense Socrates' originality
and uniqueness as they sketch his literary portrait. This need of theirs was
certainly the result of the extraordinary experience of having known an
incomparable personality, and, as Kierkegaard pointed out, 75 it is the true
explanation of the terms atopos, atopia, and atopotatos, which recur so often
in the Platonic corpus76 to describe Socrates' character. In the Theaetetus, for
instance, Socrates declares: "They say I am atopotatos, and all I create is
aporia." 77 Etymologically, atopos means "out of place," hence strange, extravagant,
absurd, unclassifiable, and disconcerting. In the Symposium, Alcibiades
insists on this point in his speech in praise of Socrates. Normally, he
says, there are classes of men, ideal types to which individuals correspond.
For example, there is the type of the "great general, noble and courageous,"
represented in Homeric antiquity by Achilles, and among contemporary
figures by the Spartan leader Brasidas. Then there is the type of the "clever
and eloquent statesman," represented in antiquity by Nestor the Greek and
Antenor the Trojan, and by Pericles among contemporaries. Socrates, however,
docs not fit into any category. He cannot be compared to any man,
concludes Alcibiades; only to Sileni or satyrs.78
Socrates was indeed an individual: that individual so dear to Kierkegaard
that he would have liked to have as an epitaph: "He was That Individual."79
And yet, although Socrates was unlike anyone else, we shall now see him
take on the mythic characteristics of Eros;80 an Eros, that is, conceived as a
projection of the figure of Socrates.
In Socrates, erotic irony is intimately connected to dialectical irony, and it
leads to reversals of situation quite analogous to those caused by the latter.
Let us be quite clear: the love in question here is homosexual love, precisely
because it is educative love. In the Greece of Socrates' day, masculine love
was a vestige and remainder of archaic warrior edU<."lltion, in which the young
nobleman was trained in the aristocratic virtues, within the framework
of virile friendship, and under the direction of an older man. The
master-disciple relationship was conceived during the period of the Sophists,
on the model of this archaic relationship, and ii waN frequently spoken of in
erotic terms. We must not, of course, for1tct tlw rolt• t'l11 ycd hy rhetoric nnd
lilcrnry fiction in thiK wny of' 11pcnkin1<."1
The Figure of Socrates 1 59
Socrates' erotic irony consisted in pretending to be in love until, thanks to
the reversal brought about by irony, the object of his amoreus attentions fell
in love himself. Such is the story Alcibiades tells in his speech in praise of
Socrates. Alcibiades, believing in the sincerity of the numerous declarations
of love Socrates had made to him, invited Socrates home one night in order
to seduce him. He slipped into bed with him, and wrapped his arms around
nim. Much to Alcibiades' surprise, however, Socrates remained in complete
control of himself, and did not let himself be seduced at all. "Since that time,''
declares Alcibiades,
I am the one who has been reduced to slavery, and I'm in the state of a
man bitten by a viper.82
I've been bitten in the heart, or the mind, or whatever you like to call
it, by Socrates' philosophy ... the moment I hear him speak I am ·
smitten with a kind of sacred rage, worse than any Corybant, and my
heart jumps into my mouth and the tears start into my eyes ... I'm not
the only one, either; there's Charmides, and Euthydemus, and ever so
many more. He's made fools of them all, just as if he were the beloved,
not the lover.83
It is hard to imagine a better commentary on this passage than the following
one, by Kierkegaard:
one might possibly call him a seducer, for he deceived the youth and
awakened longings which he never satisfied ... He deceived them all in
the same way as he deceived Alcibiades who ... observes that instead of
the lover, Socrates became the beloved ... he attracted the youth to
him, hut when they looked up to him, when they sought repose in him,
when forgetting all else they sought a safe abode in his lov�, when they
themselves ceased to exist and lived only in being loved by him - then
he was gone, then the enchantment was over, then they felt the deep
pangs of unrequited love, felt that they had been deceived and that it
was not Socrates who loved them but they who loved Socrates.8•
Socrates' erotic irony consisted in pretending to be in love. In dialectic
irony, Socrates pretended, as he asked his questions, that his real desire was
that his interlocutor communicate to him his knowledge or wisdom. In fact,
however, this game of questions and answers resulted in the interlocutor
realizing that he was incapable of curing Socrates' ignorance, for he in fact
had neither wisdom nor knowledge to give to Socrates. What the interlocutor
renlly desired, 1 hen, wns to enrol in Socrates' school: the school of the
conHcim111m·NN 111' 11111 -knowinl(.
1 60 Figures
In erotic irony, Socrates used amorous declarations to pretend that he
wanted his ostensible lover to hand over to him not his knowledge, but his
physical beauty. This situation is understandable: Socrates was not attractive,
whereas the young man was. In this case, however, the beloved - or
supposedly beloved - discovered through Socrates' attitude that he was
incapable of satisfying Socrates' love, because there was no true beauty within
him. Upon discovering his shortcomings, the beloved would then fall in love
with Socrates. It was not beauty with which the beloved fell in love - Socrates
did not have any - rather, he fell in love with the love which, according to
Socrates' definition in the Symposium,85 is desire for the beauty which all of
us lack. To be in love with Socrates, then, was to be in love with love.
This is precisely the meaning of the Symposium.86 The whole dialogue is
constructed so as to make the reader guess the identity between the figures of
Socrates and Eros. Plato depicts the guests taking turns, going from left to
right, giving speeches in praise of Eros. In succession, we hear Phaedrus and
Pausanias, then Eryximachus the doctor, Aristophanes the comic poet, and
finally the tragic poet Ariston. When Socrates' turn comes, he does not give
a straightforward speech in praise of love, for that would be contrary to his
method. Instead, he reports the conversation he had once had with Diotima,
a priestess from Mantinea, who told him the myth of the birth of Eros.
Theoretically, the dialogue would have ended here, were it not for Alcibiades'
sudden intrusion into the banquet room. Crowned with violets and ivy leaves
and rather drunk, Alcibiades submits to the rules of the banquet, but instead
of praising Eros, he gives a speech in praise of Socrates.
The identity between Socrates and Eros is underlined in several ways: not
only does the speech in praise of Socrates take its place in the series of
speeches already given in praise of Eros, but, in addition, there are many
significant features in common between the portrait of Eros, as sketched by
Diotima, and the portrait of Socrates given by Alcibiades.
On the day of Aphrodite's birth, recounts Diotima, the gods had a banquet.
Penia - that is, "Poverty" or "Privation" - came begging at the end of the
meal. There she espied Poros - "Means," "Expedient," or "Wealth" - drunk
on nectar and asleep in Zeus' garden. As a way out of her destitution, Penia
decided to have a child by Poros, so she lay with him while he slept, and
conceived Eros.
This account of the genealogy of Eros allows Diotima to give a description
of him so subtle that it can be interpreted on a variety of levels. In the first
place, following the exact words of the myth, we can recognize in Eros the
features of both his mother and his father. From his father's side, he gets his
clever, inventive mind (in Greek euporit1). From his mother, he inherits the
condition of a poverty-stricken beggar: t1p11rit1. Behind this dest.Tiption, we can
distinguish a quite pnrticulnr conccp1ion of love. W here111; 1he other guests had
described Eros in an idt.'l1li:1.ctl wily, Sm· 1·11 tl'll l'l'l'ounlN hiN l'nnverHll t inn with
The Figure of Socrates 161
Diotima in order to introduce some realism into the vision of love. Contrary
to what the other guests assume, says Socrates, it is not the case that love is
beautiful. If it were, it would no longer be love, for Eros is essentially desire,
and the only thing that can be desired is that which one does not have. Eros,
then, cannot be beautiful: as the son of Penia, he lacks beauty, but as the son
of Poros, he knows how to remedy his lack. Agathon has confused love with
its object, the beloved.
For Socrates, love is a lover. It is therefore not, as most people think, a god,
but only a daimon; a being intermediate between the human and the divine.
This is why there is something comic about Diotima's description of Eros.
In it, we can perceive the beggarly existence to which love can condemn us.
This is the familiar theme of "Militat omnis amans": 37 in which the lover
stands guard on his beloved's doorstep, or spends the night sleeping on the
ground. Eros is both beggar and soldier, but also inventor, sorcerer, magician,
and clever talker, for love makes him ingenious. For him, life is an
uninterrupted suite of discouragement and hope, need and satisfaction, which
succeed one another in accordance with the successes and defeats of his love.
This is Eros in his monstrous aspect - good-for-nothing, shameless,
obstinate, loud-mouthed and savage - whose misdeeds are depicted with such
relish in Greek poetry, right down to the Byzantine period.88
And yet, with astonishing skill, Plato makes the features of Socrates "the
philosopher" appear beneath the figure of Eros the hunter. Agathon may
think Eros is delicate and lovely, but Diotima asserts he is, in reality, always
poor, rough, dirty, and barefoot. In his speech in praise of Socrate.'>,
Alcibiades likewise portrays Socrates as barefoot, covered only by a coarse
coat which barely protects him from the winter cold.89 From the context of
the dialogue, we learn that Socrates has, exceptionally, taken a bath before
coming to the symposium.'111 The comic poets, too, had a good laugh at the
expense of Socrates' bare feet and old cloak.91
The figure of Socrates as Eros the beggar was subsequently taken up by the
Cynic philosophers, in particular Diogenes. Diogenes, who seems to have
designated himself as a "furious Socrates," used to go wandering with only
his cloak and knapsack, bereft of hearth and home:92 As Friedlander points
out,93 barefooted Eros also calls to mind primitive man, as he is depicted by
Plato in the Protagoras (32 l c5) and the Statesman (272a5).
We arc thus brought back to the figure of that purely natural being, Silenus,
with his primitive strength, more primal than culture and civilization. The fact
that this element enters into the complex portrait of Socrates/Eros is not a matter
of indifference. Rather, it corresponds perfectly to the reversal of values brought
about by Socratic L'Onsciousness. For the person concerned about his soul, what
is essential is not 10 be found in appearance, dress, or comfort, but in freedom.
And yet, I >iolimn Hl rcs.o;es that Eros has inherited some features from his
fnlhcr: "lw Kl'IN 1 1·111ll1 for noble 1muls, for he is bold, headstrong, and full of
162 Figures
endurance. He's a dangerous hunter, always plotting some trick; he lusts
after cleverness,"' is full of resources, and is always thinking up some scheme;
he's a terrible sorcerer, magician, and sophist." 95 We could very well be
listening to Strepsiades in Aristophanes' Clouds, describing what he wants
to become after his Socratic education: "audacious, glib, daring and headstrong
... never at a loss for words, a real fox." 96 In his speech praising
Socrates, Alcibiades had called him an impudent Silenus,97 and
Agathon had bestowed upon Socrates the epithet of hybristes.98 For
Alcibiades, Socrates is a magician99 and a smooth talker, skilled in attracting
pretty boys. 100
Eros' toughness appears once again in the portrait which Alcibiades
sketches of Socrates on campaign with the army. He could, Alcibiades says,
put up with cold, hunger, and fear, and hold his wine as easily as he endured
long bouts of meditation.
1
61 During the retreat from Delion, Alcibiades tells
us, Socrates walked as calmly as if he were in the streets of Athens, where
Aristophanes describes him as "holding his head high . . . rolling his eyes,
barefoot, looking solemn." 102 As we can see, this portrait of Socrates/Eros is
not very flattering; we are clearly smack in the midst of Platonic - if not
Socratic - irony. Nevertheless, this image is not without its profound
psychological truth.
Eros, Diotima tells us, is a daimon: that is, a being intermediate between
gods and men. Once more, we are forced to consider the problem of
intermediary states, and we realize once more just how uncomfortable such a
situation is. Eros the daimon, as Diotima describes him to us, is undefinable
and unclassifiable: he too, like Socrates, is alopos. He is neither god nor man,
fair nor ugly, wise nor foolish, good nor evil. 103 Yet he still embodies desire,
for, like Socrates, he is aware that he is neither handsome nor wise. This is
why he is a philo-sopher - a lover of wisdom. In other words, he desires to
attain to the level of being of divine perfection. Thus, according to Diotima's
description, Eros is the desire for his own perfection, which is to say, for his
true self. He suffers from being deprived of the plenitude of being, and he
strives to attain it. When other men fall in love with Socrates/Eros - that is,
when they fall in love with love, such as Socrates reveals it to them - what
they love in Socrates is his love for, and aspiration toward, beauty and the
perfection of being. In Socrates, they find the path toward their own
perfection.
Eros, like Socrates, is merely a call and a possibility; he is neither wisdom
nor beauty itself. To be sure, if one opens up the little Sileni mentioned by
Alcibiades, they turn out to be full of statues of gods. 104 The Sileni, however,
are not themselves the statues. They only open up so that one can get at them.
The etymological meaning of Poros, Erm;' father, is "means of access" or
"way out." Socrat·es is only n SilenuK, opcninic up onto something beyond
himsel f.
The Figure of Socrates 1 63
The philosopher, too, is nothing other than this: a summons to existence.
As Socrates puts it ironically to the handsome Alcibiades: "If you love me, it
must be because you have seen in me a beauty which bears no resemblance
to your own physical beauty ... But consider the matter more carefully, lest
you make a mistake both about me and about me and about my real
nothingness.,, 105 Here Socrates gives Alcibiades a warning. In loving Socrates,
he is really only loving Eros: not Aphrodite's son, but the son of Poros and
Penia. The cause of his love is that he senses that Socrates can open up to
him a path toward an extraordinary beauty, transcending all earthly beauties.
Socrates• virtues - those statues of the gods hidden within the ironical Silenus
- which Alcibiades admires so much, 106 are only a reflection and a foretaste of
that perfect wisdom which Socrates desires, and which Alcibiades desires
through Socrates.
In Socratic Eros, we find the same basic structure as in Socratic irony: a
divided consciousness, passionately aware that it is not what it ought to be. It
is from this feeling of separation and lack that love is born.
One of Plato's greatest merits will always be that he was able, via the myth
of Socrates/Eros, to introduce into the philosophical life the dimension of
love - that is, of desire and the irrational. He accomplished this in several
ways: in the first place, in the experience of dialogue itself, in which two
interlocutors experience a passionate will to clarify a problem together. Qµite
apart from the dialectical movement of the logos, the path traveled together
by Socrates and his partner, and their common will to come to an agreement,
arc already a kind of love. There is a great deal more philosophy in spiritual
exercises like Socrates' dialogues than in the construction of a philosophical
system. The task of dialogue consists essentially in pointing out the limits of
language, and its inability to communicate moral and existential experience.
Yet the dialogue itself, qua event and spiritual activity, already constitutes a
moral and existential experience, for Socratic philosophy is not the solitary
elaboration of a system, but the awakening of consciousness, and accession
to a level of being which can only be reached in a person-to-person
relationship.
Just like ironical Socrates, Eros teaches nothing, for he is ignorant. He does
not make people more wise; he makes them other. He, too, is maieutic: he
helps souls to engender themselves.
It is touching to trace the influence of Socratic Eros throughout history.
107 In third-century Alexandria, for instance, the Christian
writer Gregory Thaumaturgus praised his master Origen in the following
terms:
And thus, like some spark lighting upon our inmost soul, love was
kimlled and burNI into flame within us - a love at once for the Logos . . .
ond for 1hiN m1111, ilN friend 11nd advocate . .. sometimes he would
1 64 Figures
approach us in the genuine Socratic fashion, and trip us up by his
argumentation whenever he saw us getting restive under him, like so
many unbroken horses.108
As Bertram has shown in some splendid pages, 109 we encounter the tradition
of Socratic Eros and the educative daimon in Nietzsche. According to
Bertram, three sayings sum up perfectly this erotic dimension of pedagogy.
One is by Nietzsche himself: "The deepest insights spring from love alone." 1 10
Another is by Goethe: "We learn only from those we love." 1
11 Finally, there
is Holderlin's dictum: "Mortal man gives his best when he loves." 112 These
three maxims go to show that it is only through reciprocal love that we can
accede to genuine consciousness.
Using Goethe's terminology, we could characterize this dimension of love,
desire, and the irrational as the "demonic." Plato had encountered this
dimension in the person of Socrates himself. As is well known, Socrates'
daimon was a kind of inspiration which sometimes. came over him in a
completely irrational way, as a negative sign telling him not to do such and
such a thing. It was, in a sense, his real "character," or true self. Moreover,
this irrational element in Socratic consciousness is probably not without
relation to Socratic irony. It is possible that Socrates' reason for asserting that
he did not know anything was that, when it came time for action, he trusted
in his own daimon, as he also trusted in the daimon of his interlocutors. In any
case, as James Hillman pointed out in 1966, if Plato was able to bestow upon
Socrates the figure of the great daimon Eros, it was probably because, in
Socrates, he had encountered a demonic man.' 13
How can we describe this dimension of the demonic? No one could be a
better guide for us in this matter than Goethe, who was fascinated and
troubled by the mystery of the "demonic" all throughout his life. His first
encounter with the demonic had probably been Socrates' daimon, as depicted
in Hamann's Socratic Memorabilia.114 Socrates fascinated Goethe to such an
extent that we find the following extraordinary exclamation in his letter to
Herder of 1772: "If only I could be Alcibiades for one day and one night, and
then die!" 115 For Goethe, the demonic had all the ambiguous and ambivalent
features of Socratic Eros. It is, as he writes in Book 20 of Poetry and Truth, 1 1 6
a force which is neither divine nor human, neither diabolical nor angelic,
which simultaneously unites and separates all beings. Just as in the case of
Eros in the Symposium, it can only be defined by simultaneous and contradictory
negations. Yet it is a force which gives its holders an incredible power
over beings and things. The demonic represents a kind of natural magic
within the dimension of the irrational and inexplicable. This irrational
element is the motor force indispensable for 1111 cre11tion; it is the blind,
inexorable dynamic which we cannot cscllpl', but muNt r1Hhcr lc11rn how to
u11e. In hi11 llm•111·11•, Goet hl' writc!i 1111 follm\'N 11ho11 t t ill' "'""'"" of individunlN:
The Figure of Socrates
So must you be; you cannot escape yourself .
. . . no time nor power may destroy
Form marked with a seal, which develops as it lives. 1 17
1 65
In Goethe, the creatures who most faithfully represent this demonic element
take on the features of Eros in the Symposium. As Raabe has demonstrated,
this is particularly true in the case of Mignon. 1
1
8 Mignon, like Eros, is
indigent, but she aspires to purity and beauty. Although her clothing is poor
and coarse, her musical gifts reveal her inner riches. Like Eros, she sleeps on
the bare ground, or on Wilhelm Meister's doorstep. Finally, like Eros, she is
the projection and incarnation of Wilhelm Meister's nostalgia for a higher
form of life.
Another demonic figure in Goethe is Ottilia, heroine of the Elective Affinities.
She is depicted as a natural force, powerful, strange, and fascinating. Her
profound relationship to Eros is more discreetly indicated than in the case of
Mignon, but it is no less real. Mention should also be made of the
hermaphroditic figure of Homunculus, whose relationship to Eros is emphasized
so clearly in Act II of the Second Fausl .
1 19
As an ambiguous, ambivalent, indecisive element, the demonic is neither
good nor evil. Only mankind's moral decision can give it its definitive value.
And yet, this irrational, inexplicable element is inseparable from existence.
The encounter with the demonic, and the dangerous game with Eros, cannot
be avoided.
3 Dionysos
We shall now return to Nietzsche's odd, amorous hatred for Socrates. To be
sure, Bertram has already stated the essential on this point, 120 but perhaps
Nietzsche's complex attitude can be better understood by considering some
of the less frequently noticed elements which go to make up 'the Socrates of
the Symposium.
Nietzsche was quite familiar with the strange seductive powers of Socrates,
whom he termed "This mocking and enamored monster and pied piper of
Athens, who made the most overweening youths tremble and sob." 12
1 Nietzsche
tries to define the mechanism of this seduction: "I have made understandable
how it was that Socrates could repel: it is therefore all the more
necessary to explain his fascination." 122 Nietzsche then goes on to propose
several explanations: Socrates flattered the Greeks' taste for combat with his
dialectics; he was a great erotic; he understood his historical role of counteracting
instinctive decadence by means of rationality. The truth is that none of
these expl11nntion11 iN particularly fascinating. Nietzsche does, however, suggest
11 more 1m1fouml t•11uNe: the 11eduction Socrates exercised on all posterity came
1 66 Figures
from his attitude in the face of death. More specifically, it came from the
semi-voluntary nature of his death. As early as his first work, The Birth of
Tragedy, Nietzsche summed up the last pages of the Phaedo and the
Symposium in a grandiose image:
that he was sentenced to death, not exile, Socrates himself seems to have
brought about with perfect awareness and without any natural awe of
death. He went to his death with the calm with which, according to
Plato's description, he leaves the Symposium at dawn, the last of the
revelers, to begin a new day, while on the benches and on the ground
his drowsy table companions remain behind to dream of Socrates, the
true Eroticist. The dying Socrates becomes the new ideal, never seen
before, of noble Greek youths. m
Nietzsche sensed and foresaw, in the concluding scene of Plato's Symposium,
a symbol of Socrates' death. Taken by itself, Plato's description of the
scene was as simple as could be:
Only Agathon, Aristophanes and Socrates were still awake, and they
were passing a huge bowl from left to right, and drinking from it.
Socrates was holding a discussion with them ... he was gradually
forcing them to admit that one and the same author ought to be able to
compose both comic and tragic poetry ... Aristophanes was the first to
fall asleep, and then, when the sun had already risen, Agathon. Socrates
... then got up and left. He headed for the Lyceum, and, after splashing
himself with water, he spent the rest of the day just like he would have
any other.m
The ambiguous symbolism latent in this sober passage has not been lost on
modern poets. C.F. Meyer, for instance, gave the following picture of the
figure of the dying Socrates, in that dawn when only the philosopher is still
awake:
While Socrates' friends drank with him
And their heads sank down on their pillows
A young man came in - I remember it well
Along with two lithe flute-players.
We drained our cups to the dregs,
And our lips, tired from so much talk, fell silent
A song hovered above the withered garlands . , ,
Silence! The Nlccpy flutes of dcnth nre Nmmdinl(l 11'
The Figure of Socrates 167
By contrast, what Holderlin saw in this episode was Socrates the lover of life:
Yet each of us has his measure.
For hard to bear
Is misfortune, but harder still good fortune.
Yet one wise man was able
From noon to midnight, and on
Till morning lit up the sky
To keep wide awake at the banquet.126
Herein lies the enigma Socrates posed for Nietzsche. How could someone
who loved life as much as Socrates loved it seem, by his will to die, to hate
existence? For Nietzsche was quite familiar with the Socrates who loved life;
indeed, he loved him:
If all goes well, the time will come when one will take up the
Memorabiliam of Socrates rather than the Bible as a guide to morals and
reason, and when Montaigne and Horace will be employed as forerunners
and signposts to an understanding of Socrates, that simplest and most
imperishable of intercessors. The pathways of the most various philosophical
modes of life lead back to him ... Socrates excels the founder of
Christianity in possessing a joyful kind of seriousness and that wisdom full
of roguishness that constitutes the finest state of the human soul.128
We can see Socrates' "wisdom full of roguishness" in Xenophon's depiction of
Socrates dancing; 129 in the jesting, ironical Socrates of the Platonic dialogues;
and in the figure of the life-loving philosopher in Holderlin's poem "Socrates
and Alkibiades":
"Holy Socrates, why do you always
Pay court to this young man?
Do you know nothing greater?
Why do your eyes gaze lovingly· on him
As on a god?"
"He who has thought most deeply
Loves that which is the most alive.
He who has seen the world
Can understand lofty Youth.
And often, in the end,
The wise bow down before the fair."1.10
In N icl.1.Hchc'N CHHay Srh1Jpenl1auer cu Educator, the figure of Schopenhauer is
mcriccd with l hiN fiicurc of Socrntcs-as-lovcr-of-lifc. In the following
168 Figures
extraordinary passage, Nietzsche has recourse to Holderlin's verses in order
to describe the sage's gaiety:
Nothing better or happier can befall a man than to be in the proximity
of one of those victorious ones, who, precisely because they have thought
most deeply, must love what is most living and, as sages, incline in the end to
the beautiful . . . They are active and truly alive ... which is why, in their
proximity, we feel human and natural for once, and feel like exclaiming
with Goethe: "How glorious and precious is a living thing! how well
adapted to the conditions it lives in, how true, how existent!" 1

1
In The Birth of Tragedy,132 Nietzsche thought he could foresee the coming
of a musical Socrates. Socrates the musician, he thought, would answer the
call which, in Socrates' dreams, had invited the philosopher to devote himself
to music; he would thereby reconcile the ironic lucidity of rational consciousness
with demonic enthusiasm. Such a figure, says Nietzsche in his unpublished
writings, would be a true example of "tragic man." N ietzsche projected
his own dream of a reconciliation between Apollo and Dionysos into this
image of Socrates as musician.
In the dying Socrates, Nietzsche saw yet another reflection of his own
drama. Socrates wa111ed to die - this is what was so shocking to Nietzsche -
and at the moment of his death his spoke these enigmatic words: "0 Crito,
we owe a rooster to Asclepius." 133 It was as if he had been cured from some
illness, and owed a debt to the god of healing.
This ridiculous and terrible "last word" means, for those who have ears:
"0 Crito, life is a disease." Is it possible that a man like him ... should
have been a pessimist? He had merely kept a cheerful mien while
concealing all his life long his ultimate judgment, his inmost feeling.
Socrates, Socrates suffered life! And then he still revenged himself- with
this veiled, gruesome, pious, and blasphemous saying ... I wish he had
remained taciturn also at the last moment of his life; in that case he
might have belonged to a still higher order of spirits. 134
As Bertram has shown so well, Nietzsche here gives us the clue to his own secret,
intimate doubt, and to the drama of his entire existence. Nietzsche would have
liked to be the bard of the joy of life and existence; yet, in the final analysis,
wasn't he, too, afraid that life might be nothing but a disease? By letting what he
thought of terrestrial existence be known, Socrates gave his secret away. Yet
Nietzsche wanJed to belong to that "higher order of spirits": those, that is, who
<:an keep quiet about this terrifying secret. In Bertram'
s words: "Wm; his extreme,
Dionysiac pac.·m to life, and to li te nlonc, only the kind of Nilcnn.·, bcncnth which
n grl'llt educator for life did no1 believe in lilc?" I I\
The Figure of Socrates 1 69
In the Twilight of the Idols, we find one final reversal in Nietzsche's
reinterpretation of Socrates' last words. Here, the sick�ess from which
Socrates is to be cured is not life itself, but the kind of life Socrates led:
" 'Socrates is no physician,' he said softly to himself; 'here death alone is the
physician. Socrates himself has merely been sick for a long time.' " 136 On this
interpretation, Socratic lucidity and Socratic morality correspond to a sickness
gnawing away at life. Yet, here again, might not Socrates' illness be the same
as that of Nietzsche himself? This myth-dissolving lucidity, this pitiless
consciousness; are they not those of Nietzsche himself? Nietzsche's amorous
hatred for Socrates was, in the last analysis, identical with the amorous hatred
Nietzsche felt for himself. Perhaps the ambiguity of the figure of Socrates in
Nietzsche was rooted in the ambiguity of the central figure of Nietzschean
mythology: Dionysos, god of death and of life.
For reasons which, in the last analysis, remain rather mysterious for us,
Plato in his Symposium surrounded Socrates with a whole cluster of Dionysiac
symbols. 137 In fact, the entire dialogue could have been entitled The Judgment
of Dionysos, since Agathon tells Socrates that, when it comes to finding out
who is wiser, he or Socrates, they will leave the question up to Dionysos. In
other words, whoever drinks the most will win this contest of sophia - wisdom
and knowledge - placed as it is under the sign of the god of wine. m When
Alcibiades later bursts into the banquet room, he is crowned with violets and
ivy leaves, just like Dionysos.139 As soon as he comes in, Alcibiades places a
crown of headbands around Socrates' head, as it was the custom to do for the
victor in poetry contests. 140 We recall that Dionysos was the god both of
tragedy and of comedy. In the course of his speech in praise of Socrates,
Alcibiades composes what Socrates later terms "a drama of satyrs and
Sileni,'' 14
1 since these are the beings to which he compares Socrates. Again,
we recall that satyrs and Sileni formed the accompanying entourage of
Dionysos, and that the centre of satyric drama was, originally, the passion
of Dionysos. In the final scene of the Symposium, we find Socrates alone with
the tragic poet Agathon and the comic poet Aristophanes, gradually convincing
them that one and the same man should be able to be both a tragic
and a comic poet. 142 Agathon, in his praise of Eros, ·had said that love was the
greatest of poets. 143 Thus, Socrates, who excels in the field of Eros, also
excels in that of Dionysos. After all, he has no rival when it comes to holding
his wine,144 and if, as a result of the "Judgment of Dionysos," he wins the
wisdom contest, it is because he is the only one still awake at the end of the
banquet. 145 Can we discern yet another Dionysiac characteristic in his
prolonged ecstasies and transports, which are mentioned twice in the dialogue?141,

Thus, we find in Plato's Symposium what seems to be a conscious and
dclihcrntc ensemble of nllusions to the Dionysiac nature of the figure of
SocnllcN. Thi11 l'l1Nl'lllhk culminates in the final scene of the dialogue, in
170 Figures
which Socrates emerges victorious from the judgment of Dionysos, as the best
drinker and the best poet.
We should not be surprised if, paradoxically, secretly, and perhaps
unconsciously, the figure of Socrates comes, for Nietzsche, to coincide with
the figure of Dionysos.
At the end of Beyond Good and Evil, Nietzsche dedicates to Dionysos an
extraordinary panegyric of the "genius of the heart," which he repeats, as
evidence of his skill in psychological mastery, in the Ecce Homo,'41 although
this time he makes a point of refusing to say whom he is addressing. In this
hymn, it is as though we hear an echo of the Veni Sancte Spiritus,H8 that old
medieval encomium of the Holy Ghost (of which Hamann149 considered
Socrates' daimon to be a prefiguration): "Flecte quod est rigidum, fove quod
est frigidum, rege quod est devium." 15° For Nietzsche, the genius of the heart
has the same marvelously delicate power of softening, warming, and straightening.
In his portrait of the spiritual guide with demonic powers, Nietzsche
intended to describe the action of Socrates. But as Bertram has suggested,151
wasn't he also thinking - consciously or unconsciously - of Socrates?
We will conclude with Nietzsche's encomium, since it sums up admirably
all the themes of our discussion:
The genius of the heart, as that great concealed one possesses it, the
tempter god and born pied piper of consciences, whose voice knows how
to descend into the netherworld of every soul; who docs not say a word or
cast a glance in which there lies no secret goal of seduction ... the genius
of the heart who silences all that is loud and self-satisfied, teaching it to
listen; who smooths rough souls and lets them taste a new desire - to lie
still as a mirror, that the deep sky may mirror itself in them ... the genius
of the heart from whose touch everyone walks away richer, not having
received grace and surprised, not as blessed and oppressed by alien goods,
but richer in himself, newer to himself than before, broken open and
sounded out by a thawing wind; more uncertain, perhaps; tenderer, more
fragile, more broken, but full of hopes that as yet have no name.152

Aphrodisias, On Fate, p. 171, 11 Bruns. According to Zopyrus, Socrates was
stupid and slow because he lacked a hollow space between his collar-bones. We
can perhaps detect an echo of this notion in Carus' description of the "Boeotian
type"; cf. C.G. Carus, Symbolik der mensch/ichen Gestalt, 1 858, repr. Hildesheim/Damstadt

There first a little space I rest,
Then wake so glad, to scenes so kind
In earthly robes no longer drest,
This band, this girdle left behind.
And those calm shining sons of mom,
They ask not who is maid or boy;
No robes, no garments there are worn,
Our body pure from sin's alloy.

Marcus Aurelius
1 The Meditations as a Spiritual Exercise
The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius - a better translation of the Greek
title would be Exhortalions lo Himself - were first published in the West by
the Zurich humanist Andreas Gesner, in 1 558-9. Since their first appearance,
the Meditations have continued to fascinate readers. Not all of these
readers, however - and this includes many historians as well - have
always understood what Marcus Aurelius intended to accomplish by writing
this book. The seventeenth-century English editors and translators
Meric Casaubon and Thomas Gataker still had an intimate sense for ancient
realities, and were well aware of the nature of the work with which they were
dealing. The Meditations, they realized, were a collection of hypomnemata
(commentaria in Latin): notes written on a daily basis for the author's personal
use.
Many authors allude to the existence of this literary genre in antiquity.
Since they were not intended for publication, however, such writings were
destined to disappear. We owe the preservation of Marcus' Meditations to
some happy set of circumstances, quite possibly to the piety of one of the
members of the emperor's immediate entourage.
Most historians, however, have anachronistically projected the literary
prejudices of their own epoch back upon the Meditations. In the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries, when systematic treatises were considered the
perfect form of philosophical production, it was generally thought that the
Meditations should be brought into relation with the composition of some
such treatise. Scholars consequently imagined that the Meditations were the
extracts or disjecta membra of such a hypothetical opus, or perhaps a series of
notes written with a view to its publication.
In the nineteenth century, characterized as it was by romanticism, it was
widely rccogni:r.ed that the Meditations were a collection of hypomnemata or
per1mnul notc11. Frrquently, however, as in Renan's great study Marcm
1 80 Figures
Aurelius or the End of the Ancient World, 1 it was maintained that Marcus had
written "a personal diary of his inner states."
In the twentieth century, the age of psychology, psychoanalysis, and
suspicion, the very fact of having written this personal diary has been
interpreted as the symptom of a psychological malaise. It has become a clichC
to speak of the "pessimism" of Marcus Aurelius. E.R. Dodds,2 for example,
insisted on the perpetual self-criticism which Marcus carried out upon
himself, and related this tendency to a dream of Marcus ' , which is preserved
for us by Dio Cassius.3 On the night of his adoption, says Dio, the emperor
dreamed that his shoulders were made of ivory. According to Dodds,� this
suggests that Marcus suffered from an acute identity crisis.
In a collaborative study, H. van Effentcrre and the psychosomatist R. Dailly
undertook to diagnose the pathological aspects - both psychic and physiological
- of what they termed "the case of Marcus Aurelius."; Basing
themselves on the testimony of Dio Cassius,6 they supposed that Marcus
suffered from a gastric ulcer, and that the emperor's personality corresponded
to the psychological correlates of this illness:
The ulcer-sufferer is someone closed in on himself, worried, and uneasy
. .. a kind of hypertrophy of the self renders him unable to see his fellow
men ... in the last analysis, it is himself that he is looking for in others
. . . He is conscientious to the point of punctiliousness, and is more
interested in the technical perfection of administration than in human
relationships, although the former should be only the sum total of the
latter. If he is a thinking man, the ulcer-sufferer will be inclined to
search for justifications, to fabricate superior personalities, and to adopt
Stoic or Pharisaic attitudes.7
For these authors, Marcus' Meditalions arc a response to his need for
"self-persuasion" and "justification in his own eyes." H
The acme of this kind of interpretation is no doubt the article by Thomas
W. Africa, entitled "The opium addiction of Marcus Aurelius." 9 Basing
himself on passages in Galen and Dio Cassius, the author tries to detect a
genuine addiction to opium on the part of Marcus Aurelius, and he believes
he can discover its symptoms in the Meditations. In fact, however, the texts
he cites do not constitute conclusive proof of Marcus' drug addiction. As for
the texts from the Meditations themselves cited as symptoms of intoxication,
Africa's interpretation of them is pure nonsense.
Dio Cassius does not mention opium at all ; he only mentions that, during
the Danubian campaign, Marcus did not eat at night, and during the day
consumed only a bit of theriac to ease his chest and stomach. ID Galen docs
indeed mention opium, 11 but in such a way t hnt it is impossible to ded uce
from his words a genuine addict ion to opium. I le merel y 11nys thnt, during
Marcus Aurelius 181
the Danubian campaign, Marcus took a little bit of theriac every day - "in
the quantity of an Egyptian bean" - for reasons of security. This was a
frequent custom among Roman emperors, since theriac was considered an
excellent antidote against poisons. Because theriac contained poppy-juice -
that is, opium - Marcus experienced chronic fatigue during the day when he
took it. He therefore had the poppy-juice removed from the mixture, but then
began to suffer from insomnia. He again returned to taking theriac with
poppy-juice, but this time the thcriac was aged and much less strong. After
the death of Marcus' official doctor Demetrius, Galen himself was charged
with the composition of the emperor's theriac, and Marcus was entirely
satisfied with his services. Galen explained to him that his theriac was the
best, precisely because it was composed according to traditional proportions.
Marcus' problems with fatigue and insomnia were, as we can sec, merely
temporary. Marcus never sought out opium for its own sake, but for its
medicinal effects, and thanks to Galen he seems to have found the proper
balance in his dosage.
In the last note to his article, Africa himself admits that, even if one
consumed as much thcriac as Marcus did, the quantity of opium it contained
was, in all probability, insufficient to produce an opium addiction. But, he
adds, we must suppose that the prescribed doses were not always respected,
because we must find some way of explaining the strangeness of the emperor's
Meditations and the bizarre nature of the visions he describes.
Here the weakness of Africa's reasoning leaps to the eyes. We are not at all
certain, he argues, that Marcus Aurelius was an opium addict, but we have
to presume that he was, since we have somehow to explain the strangeness of
the Medittttions. This is a double sophism: first, even if Marcus' visions in the
Meditations are bizarre, nothing obliges us to explain them by means of
opium; after all, Dailly and van Effenterre were content to explain them by a
gastric ulcer!
Africa thinks he can detect analogies between the Meditations and Thomas
De Quincey's Confessions of an English Opium-eater. But is such a comparison
really possible?
We shall let Africa speak for himself: 12
Marcus' vision of time as a raging river carrying all before it into the
abyss of the future was no school doctrine of life viewed from the Porch
but an attempt to express the extended perspectives of time and space
which opium had opened up to him. Temporal and spatial dimensions
were accelerated until Europe was but a speck and the present a point
and men insects crawling on a clod. History was no longer a reference
hut an actual pageant of the past and Marcus shared the exacerbated
scns;UionN of his follow-add ict, De Quincey: "The sense of space, and
in the eml t ill' sense of time, were both powerfully affected. Buildings,
1 82 Figures
landscapes, etc., were exhibited in proportions so vast as the bodily eye is
not fitted to receive. Space swelled and was amplified to the extent of
unutterable and self-repeating infinity. This disturbed me very much less
than the vast expansion of time. Sometimes I seemed to have lived for
seventy or a hundred years in one night; nay, sometimes had feelings
representative of a duration far beyond the limits of human experience." 13
The passages from Marcus Aurelius to which Africa refers are the following:
Eternity is a kind of river of events, and a violent torrent; no sooner has
each thing been seen, than it has been carried away; another is being
carried along, and it too will be swept away. 14
Think often of the speed with which all that is and comes to be passes
away and vanishes; for Being is like a river in perpetual flux, its activities
are in constant transformation, and its causes in myriad varieties.
Scarcely anything is stable, even that which is close at hand. Dwell, too,
on the infinite gulf of the past and the future, in which all things vanish
away.15
Pace Mr Africa, this theme is abundantly attested in Stoicism. Talce, for
example, the following passages from Seneca:
Place before your mind's eye the vast spread of time's abyss and
embrace the universe; and then compare what we call human life with
infinity . . . rn
Everything falls into the same abyss ... time passes infinitely quickly ...
Our existence is a point; nay, even less; but nature, by dividing this
puny thing, has given it the appearance of a longer duration. 17
This image is a venerable one; we find it in the following fine verses of
Leonidas of Tarentum: "0 man, infinite was the time before you came to the
dawn, and infinite will be the time awaiting you in Hades. What portion of
life remains for you, but that of a point, or if there is anything tinier than a
point?" 1
8 To be sure, Marcus' river is none other than the Stoic river of
being, which "flows without ceasing," 19 but in the last analysis, it is also the
river of Heraclitus, who, Plato tells us, compared all beings to a river's flow.20
It is also, moreover, the river of the Platonists as mentioned by Plutarch: "All
things simultaneously come to be and perish: actions, words, and feelings -
for Time like a river carries everything away." 2
1 The same river is mentioned
by Ovid: "Time itself flows on in constant mot ion, just like a river ... wave
is pushed on by wavc." 21
Marcus Aurelius 1 83
When, in the passage quoted above, Seneca uses the expression propone -
"place before your mind's eye'', that is, "represent to yourself the abyss of
time" - he makes it clear that he is talking about an exercise of the
imagination which the Stoic must practice. It is an instance of the same kind
of exercise when, in his Meditations, Marcus Aurelius tries to embrace the
dimensions of the universe in his imagination, and to look at things from on
high, 2l in order to reduce them to their true value.
Think of the whole of being, in which you participate to only a tiny
degree; think of the whole of eternity, of which a brief, tiny portion has
been assigned to you; think about fate, of which you are such an
insignificant part. 24
If you were to find yourself suddenly raised up into the air, and
observed from on high the busy hodgepodge of human affairs, you
would despise them, as you saw at the same time how vast is the domain
of the beings inhabiting the air and the ether.25
You have the power to strip off many superfluous things that are
obstacles to you, and that depend entirely upon your value-judgements;
you will open up for yourself a vast space by embracing the whole
universe in your thoughts, by considering unending eternity, and by
reflecting on the rapid changes of each particular thing; think of how
short is the span between birth and dissolution, and how vast the chasm
of time before your birth, and how the span after your dissolution will
likewise be infinite.26
The rational soul ... travels through the whole universe and the void
that surrounds it ... it reaches out into the boundless extent of infinity,
and it examines and contemplates the periodic rebirth of all things. 27
Asia and Europe arc little corners of the world; every sea is a droplet in
the world; each present instant of time is a point in eternity; everything
is puny, unstable, and vanishing.28
How puny a portion of infmite, gaping eternity has been assigned to each
man; it vanishes with all speed into the Unending. How puny a portion
of the substance of the All; how puny a portion of the soul of the All. Of
the whole of the earth, how puny is the lump you are crawling on!29
The difference between these texts and the passage quoted above from De
Qµincey lcnpN to t he eye. For the latter, the distortion of time and space is,
n11 it wc1·c, impoNcd upon him from outside; the addict is the passive victim
1 84 Figures
of his impressions. For Marcus, by contrast, the consideration of the infinity
of time and space is an active process; this is made quite clear by his repeated
admonitions to "represent to himself" and "think of" the totality of things.
We have to do here with a traditional spiritual exercise which utilizes the
faculties of the imagination. De Quincey speaks of a distortion of the instant,
which takes on monstrous proportions. Marcus, by contrast, speaks of an
effort to imagine the infinite and the all, in order that all instants and places
may be seen reduced to infinitesimal proportions. In Marcus' case, this
voluntary exercise of the imagination presupposes a belief in the classical Stoic
cosmological scheme: the universe is situated within an infinite void, and its
duration is comprised within an infinite time, in which periodic rebirths of
the cosmos are infinitely repeated. Marcus' exercise is intended to provide
him with a vision of human affairs capable of replacing them within the
perspective of universal nature.
Such a procedure is the very essence of philosophy. We find it repeated -
in identical form, beneath superficial differences of vocabulary - in all the
philosophical schools of antiquity.30 Plato, for instance, defines the philosophical
nature by its ability to contemplate the totality of time and being, and
consequently to hold human affairs in contempt.31 We encounter this same
theme32 among Platonists like Philo of Alexandria·13 and Maximus of Tyre;34
in Neopythagoreanism35 among the Stoics,36 and even among the Epicureans,
as we have seen in the passage from Metrodorus quoted above. 37
In Cicero's Dream of Scipio, the grandson of Scipio Africanus contemplates
the earth from on top of the Milky Way. The earth appears so small to him
that the Roman empire seems imperceptible, the inhabited world resembles a
tiny island in the midst of the ocean, and life itself seems less substantial than
a point.38 This theme was kept alive throughout Western tradition. One thinks
of Pascal's "two infinities": "Let the earth seem like a point ... compared to
the vast orbit described by this star ... " 39
Marcus Aurelius' notes to himself give us very little information about his
personal experiences. To be sure, in some chapters of the Meditations we can
discern some minimal autobiographical data, but these are few and far
between (only 35-40 chapters, out of 473, contain such information). Often,
these details consist in no more than a name, such as Pantheia, mistress of
Lucius Verus, who sat next to her lover's tomb, or the mimes Philistion,
Phoibos, and Origanion. Marcus tells us practically nothing about himself.
But what about those numerous statements by Marcus which seem steeped
in pessimism? Don't they tell us anything about his psychological states? If
one gathers them together, they certainly give the impression of a complete
disdain for human affairs. We seem to find in them the expression of
bitterness, disgust, and even "nausea" 40 in the face of hum an existence: "Just
like your bath-water appears to you - oil, sweat, filth, dirty water, all kinds
of loathsome stuff - such is ench port ion of life, 11nd every Nllh11t11ncc." 41 In
Marcus Aurelius 1 85
the first instance, this kind of contemptuous expression is reserved for the
flesh and the body, which Marcus calls "mud," "dirt," and "impure blood." 42
Yet the same treannent is reserved for things mankind usually considers as
important values:
These foods and dishes . . . are only dead fish, birds and pigs; this
Falemian wine is a bit of grape-juice; this purple-edged toga is some
sheep's hairs dipped in the blood of shellfish; as for sex, it is the rubbing
together of pieces of gut, followed by the spasmodic secretion of a little
bit of slime.43
Marcus takes a similarly illusion-free view of human activities: "Everything
highly prized in life is empty, petty, and putrid; a pack of little dogs biting
each other; little children who fight, then laugh, then burst out crying." 44 The
war in which Marcus defended the borders of the empire was, for him, like
a hunt for Sarmatian slaves, not unlike a spider's hunt for flies.45 Marcus cast
a pitiless glance on the chaotic agitation of human marionettes: "Think about
what they're like when they're eating, sleeping, copulating, defecating. Then
think of what they're like when they're acting proud and important, when
they get angry and upbraid their inferiors.""" Human agitation is all the more
ridiculous because it lasts only an instant, and ends up as very little indeed:
"Yesterday, a little bit of slime, tomorrow ashes or a mummy." 47
Two words suffice to sum up the human comedy: all is banal, and all is
ephemeral. Banal, because nothing is new under the sun:
Always bear in mind that everything is exactly the way it comes to pass
right now; it has happened that way before, and it will happen that way
again. Make them come alive before your mind's eye, these monotonous
dramas and scenes, which you know through your own experience or
through ancient history; picture the whole court of Hadrian, of Antoninus,
of Philip, Alexander, and Croesus. All these spectacles were
identical; the only thing that changed were the actors.48
Banality and boredom reach the point of being sickening:
Just as you get sick of the games in the arena and such places, because
they arc always the same, and their monotony makes the spectacle
tedious, so feel the same way about life as a whole. From top to bottom,
everything is the same, and comes from the same causes. How long will
this go on?49
Not only arc hum1tn nffnirs tedious: they arc also transitory. Marcus tries to
mnkc the hunutn 11wnrm11 of 11ast ages come alive in his imagination,111 picturing
i86 Figures
the days of Trajan or Vespasian, with their weddings, illnesses, wars, feasts,
trading, agriculture, ambition, and intrigues. All these human masses have
disappeared without a trace, observes Marcus, along with their activities.
Marcus also tries to imagine this incessant process of destruction at work
upon those around him.51
Marcus has no patience for those who would try to console themselves for
the brevity of existence by the hope that they will survive in the name they
leave to posterity. "What's in a name?" he asks: "A mere noise, or a faint
echo." 52 At best, this miserable, fleeting thing will be transmitted to a few
generations, each of which will last as long as a lightning-flash in the infinity
of time.53 We ought not to be fooled by such an illusion: "How many do not
even know your name, and how many will very soon forget it." 54 "Soon you
will have forgotten everything; soon, too, everything will have forgotten
you." ss
Such an accumulation of pessimistic utterances is indeed impressive. We
should be careful, however, of deducing from them over-hasty conclusions
about Marcus' own psychology. It is too facile for us to imagine that, like
many modem authors, ancient writers wrote in order directly to communicate
information, or the emotions they happened to be feeling. We assume, for
instance, that Marcus' Meditations were intended to transmit his everyday
feelings to us; that Lucretius was himself an anxious person, and used his
poem On the Nature of Things to try to combat his anxiousness; that
Augustine was really confessing himself in his Confessions. In fact, however,
it is not enough to consider the obvious, surface meaning of the phrases in an
ancient text in order fully to understand it. Rather, we must try to understand
why these phrases were written or spoken; we must discover their finality.
Generally speaking, we can say that Marcus' seemingly pessimistic declarations
are not expressions of his disgust or disillusion at the spectacle of life;
rather, they are a means he employs in order to change his way of evaluating
the events and objects which go to make up human existence. He does this
by defining these events and objects as they really are - "physically," one
might say - separating them from the conventional representations people
habitually form of them. Marcus' definitions of food, wine, purple togas, or
sexual union arc intended to be "natural." They are technical, almost medical
definitions of objects which, when considered in a purely "human" way,
provoke the most violent passions, and we are to use them to free ourselves
from the fascination they exercise upon us. Such definitions do not express
Marcus' impressions; on the contrary, they correspond to a point of view
intended to be objective, and which is by no means Marcus' invention. Already
in antiquity, for instance, Hippocrates and Democritus were said to have
defined sexual union as "a little epilepsy."
When Marcus pitiles.11ly imagines the intimate life of the arrogant "eating,
sleeping, copulating, defecating," he iH t rying lo ((ivc 11 p/011fral v iNinn of
Marcus Aurelius 1 87
human reality. We find a similar reflection in Epictetus, concerning people
who are content just to discourse about philosophy: "I'd like to stand over
one of these philosophers when he's having sex, so as to see how he sweats
and strains, what kind of grunts and groans he utters; whether he can even
remember his own name, much less the philosophical discourses he has heard,
declaimed, or read!" 56 Marcus applies the same method to our idea of death:
"consider what it is to die; and that, if one looks at death in and of itself,
dissolving the images associated with death by taking apart our common
conception of it, he will not suspect it to be anything other than a product of
Na tu re." 57
As we have seen, Marcus' effort to confront existence in all its naked reality
leads him to glimpse processes of decay and dissolution already at work in the
people and things around him, or to make the court of Augustus come alive
before his eyes for an instant, so as to realize that all these people, so alive in
his imagination, are in fact long dead. Yet we have no more right to interpret
this as obsession with death or morbid complacency than when, in the film
Dead Poets' Socie�y, Robin Williams makes his students study a picture of the
school's old boys. Williams' character is trying to make his charges understand
the meaning of carpe diem ("seize the day"), the irreplaceable value of
each instant of life, and it is with this goal in mind that he emphasizes that
all the faces in the class photograph, so young and alive, arc now long dead.
Moreover, when Marcus speaks of the monotony of human existence, it is
not in order to express his own boredom, but in order to persuade himself
that death will not deprive us of anything essential. In Lucretius, the same
argument is used by nature herself, to console man for the misfortune of
death: "There is no new invention I can think up to please you; everything
is always the same ... what lies in store for you is always the same ... even
if you were never to die." 58
In the case of Marcus Aurelius, all these declarations are the conscious,
voluntary application of a method which he formulates in the following terms:
always make a definition or description of the object that occurs in your
representation, so as to be able to see it as it is iri its essence, both as a
whole and as divided into its constituent parts, and say to yourself its
proper name and the names of those things out of which it is composed,
and into which it will be dissolved.59
This method is quintessentially Stoic: it consists in refusing to add subjective
value-judgments - such as "this object is unpleasant," "that one is good,"
"this one is bad," "that one is beautiful," "this is ugly" - to the "objective"
representation of things which do not depend on us, and therefore have no
morn! v11luc.·. The StoicK' notorious phantasia kata/eptike - which we have
trn11Nl11tt•d 1111 1111hl,•t·1 ivc representation" - tokes place precisely when we
1 88 Figures
refrain from adding any judgment value to naked reality.60 In the words of
Epictetus: "we shall never give our assent to anything but that of which we
have an objective representation," 61 and he adds the following illustration:
So-and-so's son is dead.
What happened?
His son is dead.
Nothing else?
Not a thing.
So-and so's ship sank.
What happened?
His ship sank.
So-and-so was carted off to prison.
What happened?
He was carted off to prison.
- But if we now add to this "He has had bad luck," then each of us is
adding this observation on his own account.62
In these objective/realistic definitions, some historians63 believe they can
discover the traces of an attitude of repugnance in the face of matter and the
objects of the physical world. Thus, according to this view, Marcus Aurelius
renounced the Stoic doctrine of the immanence of divine reason in the world
and in matter, and there is no longer any trace in him of the admiration felt
by Chrysippus for the phenomenal world. We can therefore, it is alleged, find
traces in Marcus of a tendency to affirm the transcendence of a divinity
existing apart from the phenomenal world.
Some passages in Marcus do indeed seem provocative in this regard, but
they require the most painstaking interpretation. When, for instance, Marcus
evokes "the putridity of the matter underlying all things ... liquid, dust,
bones, stench," M he does not mean to say that matter itself is putrefaction;
rather, he wants to emphasize that the transformations of matter, qua natural
processes, are necessarily accompanied by phenomena which seem to us to be
repugnant, although in reality they too are natural.
The passage we have cited above65 may seem even more provocative: "Just
like your bath-water appears to you - oil, sweat, filth, dirty water, all kinds
of loathsome stuff - such is each portion of life, and every substance." This
concise text can be interpreted in several different ways. In the first place, we
could say that Marcus is here applying his method of objective definitions.
What he means to say would be this: "when I observe physical and
physiological phenomena as they truly are, I have to admit that there nre
many aspects of them which seem to me to he diNl(UNt inl( or 1 rlvi11l: 1 hcy
Marcus Aurelius 1 89
consist of dust, the filth which covers abandoned objects, bad smells, and
stenches. Our objective representation must recognize all .these aspects of
reality, without seeking to conceal any of them." Yet this realist vision has a
threefold function. In the first place, it is intended to prepare us to confront
life such as it is. As Seneca remarks,
To be offended by these things is just as ridiculous as to complain that
you got splashed in the bath, or that you got pushed around in a crowd,
or that you got dirty in a mud-puddle. The same things happen in life
as in the baths, in a crowd, or on the road ... Life is not a delicate
thing.
66
Secondly, the realistic outlook is not intended to deny the immanence of
reason in the world, but to persuade us to search for reason where it can be
found in its purest state: in the daimon or inner genius, that guiding principle
within man, source of freedom and principle of the moral life.
Finally, by reinforcing the sombre tones of disgust and repulsion, such
definitions are intended to provide a contrast with the splendid illumination
which transfigures all things when we consider them from the perspective of
universal reason. Elsewhere, Marcus does not hesitate to declare:
Everything comes from above, whether it has originated directly in that
common directing principle, or whether it is a necessary consequence
thereof. Thus, the gaping jaws of a lion, poison, and all kinds of
unpleasant things, like thorns and mud, are by-products of those
venerable, beautiful things on high. Don't imagine, therefore, that these
unpleasant things are alien to that principle you venerate, but rather
consider that source of all things. 67
Here it is quite clear that filth, dust, and other such apparently repulsive
aspects of reality are the necessary consequence of a natural process which, in
the last analysis, goes back to universal reason. It is thus not matter itself
which seems repulsive to us, but the accessory phenomena which accompany
its transformations. Here Marcus68 is in complete accord with Stoic orthodoxy,
according to which matter is docile and subservient to reason, which
molds and governs it. The function of Marcus' physico/objective definitions
is precisely to make us realize that the feelings of repulsion we feel in the
presence of some phenomena which accompany natural processes are nothing
but an anthropocentric prejudice. In the following charming passage, Marcus
expresses his belief that nature is beautiful in all its aspects:
There iK Komc:thing pleasant and attractive about even the incidental
hy-prudm·111 of 11111ur1d l'hc:nomc:na. For instance, when bread is being
190 Figures
baked, some parts of it split open, and it is precisely those parts which
split apart in this way, and which, in a sense, have nothing to do with
bread-making itself, which are somehow quite appropriate, and excite
our appetite in a most particular way. The same is true of figs: it is when
they are at their ripest that they burst open. In the case of very ripe
olives, it is precisely their proximity to decay which adds to them a
certain beauty. The same is true with ripe ears of corn which bend
towards the ground; with the lion's wrinkled forehead; with the foam
spuming forth from the mouths of wild pigs, and many other such
things: if we look at them in isolation, they are far from being beautiful.
Nevertheless, because they are incidental by-products of natural processes,
they add to the beauty of these processes and have an attractive
effect on us. Thus, as long as one has a feeling for, and a deep
understanding of Nature's processes, there is scarcely any of the things
that occur as incidental by-products which will not present itself to one
as pleasant, at least in some of its aspects. Such a person ... will look
upon the actual gaping jaws of wild beasts with no less pleasure than
upon all the imitations of them that sculptors and painters offer us. With
his wise vision, he will be able to discern the rich maturity of old men
and women, as well as the lovely charm in young children; and there
arc many such things, which do not appeal to everyone; only to that
person who has truly familiarized himself with nature and its workings.69
It is instructive to compare this text with the passage from Aristotle quoted
abovc.70
Already in Aristotle, but especially in Marcus Aurelius, we can see a
revolution taking place. In the place of an idealistic aesthetics, which considers
as beautiful only that which is rational and functional, manifesting beautiful
proportions and an ideal form, there appears a realistic aesthetics which finds
beauty in things just the way they are, in everything that lives and exists. We
know from Aulus Gellius,71 moreover, that Marcus' distinction between
nature's original plan and the unforeseen consequences resulting from this
plan goes back to Chrysippus. Thus, in this case as well, Marcus stands firmly
within orthodox Stoic tradition.
To return to the "provocative" passage with which we began:72 it appears
that Marcus' meaning is as follows. When dealing with what the Stoics
termed indiflerentia73 - that is, things which depend not upon us, but upon
universal nature- we must not make any distinction between what is repulsive
and what is pleasant; any more than does nature itself.74 Dirt, mud, and
thorns, after all, come from the same source as the rose and the springtime.
Thus, from the point of view of nature, and therefore also of whoever is
familiar with nature, there is no d istinction t.o he made between hath-water
and the rest of ercntion: cvcrythinl{ iN l'lJUnlly "nntur11I ."
Marcus Aurelius 191
We can hardly hope to deduce Marcus' psychological states from any of
the preceding. Was he an optimist or a pessimist? Did he suffer from a
stomach ulcer? The Meditations do not allow us to respond to these questions.
All we can learn from them is about spiritual exercises, as they were
traditionally practiced by the Stoics.
2 Epictetus
In Marcus Aurelius' day, the greatest authority in questions of Stoicism was
Epictetus. As the slave of Epaphroditus, one of Nero's freedmen, Epictetus
had attended the classes of the Stoic Musonius Rufus. When Epictetus in turn
was subsequently freed by Epaphroditus, he opened a philosophy school at
Rome. In AD 93-4, Epictetus fell victim to the edict by which the emperor
Domitian banished philosophers from Rome and Italy, and he set himself up
in Nicopolis in Epirus. There he opened another school, where one of his
regular students was the future civil servant and historian Arrian of Nicomedia.
It was Arrian who was responsible for transmitting what we know about
Epictetus' teaching; for Epictetus, like many philosophers in antiquity, never
wrote anything down.
What Arrian thus preserved for us was not the technical part of Epictetus'
philosophical instruction - his commentaries on Stoic authors such as
Chrysippus, for example, or his more general explanations of doctrine.
Rather, what Arrian copied down was the discussions which, as was usual in
ancient philosophical schools, took place after the technical part of the class.
In these discussions, the master would reply to questions from his audience,
or enlarge upon particular points which were of importance for leading a
philosophical life.75 It is important to emphasize this point, for it means that
we must not expect to find technical, systematic expositions of every aspect
of Stoic doctrines in Epictetus' Discourses. Instead, they deal with a rather
limited number of problems, for the most part restricted to ethical matters.
This does not prove, of course, that Epictetus did not take up the whole of
the Stoic system in the course of his theoretical teaching. Besides, only the
first four books of Arrian's work have survived. We know from a passage in
Aulus Gellius,76 who cites an extract from the fifth book of Epictetus'
Discourses, that a part of the work has been lost. For these two reasons, then,
we must be wary of concluding, on the basis of these collections of Arrian's
notes, that theoretical philosophical teaching gradually became impoverished
in the course of later Stoicism.
What we can say is that Epictetus did insist very strongly upon a concept
that was traditional in Stoicism:n the difference between discourse about
philosophy and the practice of philosophy itself.
h is 11omc1ime11 claimed that the Stoics recognized two parts of philosophy:
on the cmc h111ul , t h�y di11tinguished :i theoretical-discursive part, comprising

physics and logic; that is, the study of nature and of the rules of discourse.
On the other, there was the practical part of philosophy, corresponding to
ethics. This is incorrect. Rather, both theoretical philosophical discourse and
philosophy itself as it was lived and experienced were made up of three
constituent parts.
In theoretical philosophical discourse, the three parts of philosophy were
necessarily distinguished. They were made the object of separate explanations,
developed according to a logical principle of succession, and they laid the
foundations for and developed the basic principles of Stoic doctrine. On the
level of theoretical discourse, then, the parts of philosophy were in a sense
external to one another, in accordance with the requirements of didactic
exposition. Philosophy itself, however, is the exercise of wisdom; it is a unique
act, renewed at each instant, and it may be j ust as well described as the
exercise of logic, physics, or ethics, according to the subject-matter on which
it is exercised, without its unity being in any way diminished. On this level,
we are no longer concerned with theoretical logical - that is, the theory of
correct reasoning - rather, we are concerned not to let ourselves be deceived
in our everyday lives by false representations. We arc no longer concerned
with theoretical physics - the theory of the origin and evolution of the cosmos
- we are concerned with being aware at every instant that we are parts of the
cosmos, and that we must make our desires conform to this situation . We no
longer do ethical theory - the definition and classification of virtues and
duties - we simply act in an ethical way.
Concrete philosophical praxis requires that we always bear in mind
the Stoics' fundamental dogmas. These dogmas were intended to constitute
the basis for our rectitude of judgment, our attitude toward the
cosmos, and the conduct we should adopt towards our fellow citizens within
the city. Philosophy as it was lived and experienced thus implied continuous
exercises of meditation and constant vigilance, in order to keep alive in one's
mind the principles taught by theoretical discourse.
If we want to understand why Epictetus attaches so much importance to
what he terms "the three areas of exercises," we shall have to bear in mind
this distinction between theoretical philosophical discourse and concrete
philosophy as it is lived and experienced. In the Discourses as reported by
Arrian, these three areas are presented with such systematic rigor that we are
j ustified in suspecting that this doctrine had an important role to play in
Epictetus' theoretical teaching.
Epictetus bases his doctrine on the traditional Stoic distinction between
things which depend on us and things which do not: "What depends on us
is value-judgments, inclinations to act, desires, aversions, and, in a word,
everything that is our doing. What does not depend on us is the body, wealth,
glory, high political positions, and, in a word, everything that is not our own
doing." 78 What depends u1,on us is t he nets of our own soul, hcc11u11c we 11rc
Marcus Aurelius 1 93
able freely to choose them. What does not depend on us is those things that
depend on the general course of nature and of fate. Among the acts of the
soul which do depend on us, some correspond to the area of judgment and
assent, others to the area of desire, and, finally, still others correspond to the
area of inclinations to action.
For Epictetus, then, it is these three areas, acts of the soul, or aspects of
"that which depends on us" which define the three forms of philosophical
exercises. By comparing the relevant passages in Epictetus' Discourses,19 we
can present the theory of the three forms or areas of philosophical exercises
as follows.
The first area is that of desire and aversion. People are unhappy because
they desire things they may either lose or fail to obtain, and because they try
to avoid misfortunes which are often inevitable. This happens because such
desiderata as wealth and health, for example, do not depend on us. The
discipline of desire consequently consists in accustoming ourselves to the
gradual renunciation of such desires and aversions, so that, in the end, we
shall desire only that which does depend on us - moral virtue - and shall also
avoid only that which depends on us - moral evil. We are to regard everything
which does not depend on us as indifferent; that is to say, we must not make
any difference between such things. Rather, we must accept them all, willed as
they are by universal nature. The discipline of desire concerns the passions
or emotions ( pathe) which we feel as a result of what happens to us.
The second area of exercises is that of motivating inclinations, or action.
For Epictetus, this area is related first and foremost to human relationships
within the city. It corresponds to what the Stoics traditionally called "the
duties" (ta kathekonta): those actions which are appropriate to the inclinations
of our nature. Duties are actions - they thus fall under the category of things
which depend on us - bearing upon objects which do not depend on us - such
as other people, politics, health, art, etc. As we have seen, such objects ought
to be matters of indifference; yet, by dint of a reasonable justification, they
can be considered as corresponding to that deeply-embedded instinct which
impels rational human nature to act for its own conservation. Duties are thus
actions "appropriate" to our rational nature, and they consist in placing
ourselves in the service of the human community, in the form of the city/state
and of the family.
The third area of exercises is that of assent (sunkatathesis). Epictetus urges
us to criticize each representation ( phantasia) as it presents itself to us, and
give our assent only to that which is "objective." In other words, we are to
set aside all subjective value-judgments. Epictetus formulates the principle
guiding this exercise as follows: "People are not troubled by things, but by
their j udgements abo111 things." 80
For Epk-u:tu11, these three areas (topoi) of exercise correspond to the
t hree 1111pcL'IN 1 11' 11hil111111phy as it is lived and experienced, as opposed to
194 Figures
the three parts of philosophical discourse. This becomes clear from a passage
in the Discourses in which he criticizes pseudo-philosophers, who are content
just to read theoretical discourses about philosophy. Here we can clearly see
that the second and third areas correspond respectively to ethics and to
dialectics. The connection between logic and the third of our topoi is
particularly evident:
It is as if, in the area of the exercise of assent, we were surrounded by
representations, some of them "objective" and others not, and we did not
want to distinguish between them, but preferred to read treatises with
titles like On Comprehension! How does this come about? The reason is
that we have never carried out our reading or our writing in such a way
that, when it comes to action, we could use the representations we receive
in a way consonant with nature; instead, we arc content when we have
learned what is said to us, and can explain it to others; when we can
analyze syllogisms and examine hypothetical arguments.81
In this passage, Epictetus underlines the opposition between, on the one hand,
theoretical logic, as it was set forth in treatises with titles like On Comprehension;
and, on the other, what we might term "lived logic," or logic as applied
to life, which consists in the discipline of assent, and the critique of those
representations which actually do present themselves to us. In the rest of this
passage, we find the same opposition between theoretical discourse and
practical, "lived" exercises, this time with regard to the second area. Epictetus
shows that the only justification for reading theoretical treatises like On
Inclination or On Duties is so that, in concrete situations, we can act in
conformity with mankind's rational nature.
In the tripartite division of philosophy,112 the areas of logic and ethics are
followed by that of physics. Can physics, then, be made to correspond to the
discipline of desire? It would seem as though the passage we have just quoted
prohibits such an identification. When, in the context of the discipline of
desire, Epictetus speaks of treatises entitled On Desire and Aversion, we have
every reason to believe these were treatises relating to ethics. However, even
though the abstract theory of "desire" as such, insofar as it is an act of the
soul, pertains to the areas of ethics and psychology, the lived attitude which
corresponds to the discipline of desire does indeed seem to be a kind of
applied physics, which one lives and experiences in the manner of a spiritual
exercise. On several occasions, Epictetus insists that the discipline of desire
consists in "learning to desire that everything happen just the way it does
happen." 83 We are to "keep our will in harmony with what happens,"JH and
to "be well-pleased with the divine government of things. " Hl "If a good man
could foresee the future, he would cooper11te with Nickness, death, and
mutilation; for he would he awnrc lhnl thiK lml lll'cn ord11 ined hy t he univcrNal
Marcus Aurelius 195
order of things, and that the whole is more important than its parts." 86 We
have here a true case of physics lived and experienced as a spiritual exercise.
Since, in order to discipline their desires, people need to be intensely
conscious of the fact that they are a part of the cosmos, they must replace
each event within the perspective of universal nature.
Such, for Epictetus, is the practice and exercise of philosophy, and we find
this fundamental scheme repeated throughout the Discourses. Epictetus'
disciple Arrian, who was responsible for the redaction of both the Discourses
and the Manual, made no mistake in this regard, when he chose to group the
sayings which make up the Manual according to the three disciplines or areas
we have just distinguished. 87
3 Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus
It is fair to say that the essential substance of Marcus Aurelius' Meditations c.-omes
from Epictetus. In the first place, it is probably from Epictetus that Marcus got
the very idea of the literary genre of meditation by means of writing: "These are
the kinds of things on which lovers of wisdom ought to meditate; they ought to
write them down every day, and use them to train themselves." 811 "Let these
thoughts be 'at hand' for you, day and night Write them down and re-read them;
talk about them, both to yourself and with others." 119
The idea of dialogue with oneself had existed for a long time; one thinks
of Homer's depiction of Odysseus admonishing himself: "Bear up, my
heart." 90 The custom of writing down, for one's personal use, either one's
own thoughts or the sayings one has read is also no doubt extremely old.
Nevertheless, we have every reason to believe that it was from Epictetus that
Marcus derived the idea of this particular form of self-exhortation and
conversation with oneself, bearing as it does upon the same rules of life and
principles of action upon which Epictetus had advised his readers to meditate.
The object of Marcus' meditations and exercises was none other than
Epictetus' three fundamental themes: the discipline of desire, the discipline
of inclinations, and the discipline of judgment. This conceptual structure is
peculiar to Epictetus, and is found nowhere else in the philosophical literature
of antiquity.91 Moreover, in the course of a series of quotations from
Epictetus, Marcus cites a fragment which clearly sets forth the three themes
we have been examining:
What must be found is a method with regard to assent [to sugkatatit/1es1hai
]. In the area [topos] of the inclinations [honnai ], we must keep
vigilant our attentive faculty, so that these inclinations may operate with
reserve:, in l hc 11crvicc of the community, and in a way corresponding to
t he v11lur uf lhl'ir ohjcclN. Finally, when it comes to things that do not
196 Figures
depend on us, we must abstain totally from desire [orekseos apekhesthai]
and feel no aversion towards any of them.92
Additionally, Marcus repeatedly formulates the triple rule of life himself. We
can easily recognize it in the following passages:
What is enough for you?
- Your present value-judgement, so long as it is objective;
- The action you are accomplishing at the present moment, so long as it
is done for the benefit of the human community;
- Your present inner disposition, as long as it rejoices in every event
brought about by causes outside yoursclf.93
A rational nature is proceeding as it should if it fulfills the following
conditions:
- If, in its representations [ phantasiai ], it does not give its assent
[sugkatatithemene] either to what is false, or to what is unclear;
- If it guides its inclinations [honnas] only towards those actions which
serve the human community;
- If it has desire [orekseis] or aversion only for things that depend on us,
while joyfully greeting everything allotted to it by universal nature.94
Wipe out your representations [phantasian].
Check your inclinations [honnaij.
Extinguish your desire [oreksin].
Keep your directing principle [hegemonikon] under your control.95
On what, then, should we exert our efforts? Only this:
- correct intentions;
- actions [prakseis] carried out in the service of the community;
- speech [logos] which could never be used to deceive;
- an inner disposition [diathesis] which joyfully greets each event like
something necessary and familiar, since it flows from so grand a
principle, and so great a source.'16
The reader will perhaps have noticed that, although it is quite obvious that
Marcus Aurelius took over his tripartite structure from Epictetus, there is
nevertheless a difference in tone and emphasis in Marcus' presentation of it.
When, for instance, Marcus speaks of the discipline of desire, he does not, as
Epictetus had done, insist on the necessity of desiring only those things which
depend on us - that is, moral good - so that our desires may not be frustrated.
Rather, Marcus, in n much more explicit way thlln EpictctuK, concei ves of this
exercise as putting our desires in harmony with the will of fate 1111d of
Marcus Aurelius 1 97
universal reason. Its goal is to bring about within us an attitude of indifference
to indifferent things; that is, whatever does not depend on us. For Marcus,
much more than for Epictetus, the discipline of desire takes on the form of
applied "physics," or physics transformed into a spiritual exercise.
The discipline of desire culminates in a joyful, loving satisfaction97 in
the events willed by nature. But in order to achieve this state, we must
totally change our way of looking at things. We must consider them from the
point of view of universal nature, and this implies learning to recognize the
chain of causes which produce each event. We are to consider each event as
woven by destiny, and as flowing forth by natural necessity from the first
causes. The discipline of desire thus obliges us to relocate the totality of
human life within a coi.mic perspective, and become aware of the fact that we
are a part of the world: "He who doesn't know what the world is doesn't
know where he himself is, either. He who doesn't know for what purpose the
world exists, doesn't know who he is himself. Whoever doesn't know the
answer to one of these questions is unable to say for what purpose he himself
exists." 98
In order to practice this kind of "physics," Marcus, as we have seen, tries
to follow a rigorous method of definition,99 which consists in relocating all
objects within the totality of the universe, and all events within the nexus of
causes and effects. They are to be defined in and for themselves, and
separated from the conventional, anthropomorphic representations mankind
habitually makes of them.
Here we can perhaps glimpse in what way the three disciplines, like the
three parts of philosophy, imply one another within the single act of
philosophizing. The method of "physical" definition discussed by Marcus
corresponds to the discipline of assent, which prescribes that we must give
our assent only to those representations which are objective and freed from
all subjective value-judgments.
Once prolonged experience has allowed us to come to know nature's ways
and laws, "physics," when practiced as a spiritual exercise, leads us to
"familiarity" with nature.11lD Thanks to this familiarity, we can perceive the
links between all phenomena which seem strange or repugnant to us, and
between these phenomena and universal reason, the source from which they
flow. From such a perspective, every event will seem to us beautiful and
worthy of our affectionate assent. To be indifferent to indifferent things means
to make no difference between them; in other words, to love them equally, just
as nature does: " 'The earth loves the rain; she also loves the venerable
Ether.'101 And the Universe, too, loves to produce all that must be produced.
Thus, I say to the Universe: 'I love along with you!' Isn't this, after all, the
meaning of of the phrase, 'Such-and-such an event "loves" to happen?' " 10
2
When , in ancient Greek, one wished to say that something "usually occurs,"
m "iN lll'CUNtomcd to occur," n common idiom made it pm;siblc to sny the
198 Figures
event "loves" to occur ( philei ginesthai). Here, Marcus gives us to understand
that events literally "love" to happen. We are to "love" to see them happen,
because universal nature "loves" to produce them.
In the last analysis, such an attitude of joyful consent to the world
corresponds to an attitude of obedience to the divine will. This is why Marcus
sometimes describes the discipline of desire as an invitation to "follow the
gods" or "God," as in the following presentation of the three disciplines:
"Keep the daimon within you in a state of serenity; so that it may follow God
in an appropriate way, neither saying anything contrary to the truth, nor doing
anything contrary to justice." 103 In the formulation of the second theme,
Epictetus placed more emphasis on the fact that our inclinations and actions
must be related to our duties (kathekonta) toward our fellow-men. Marcus, by
contrast, speaks more often about just actions, done in the service of the
human community. As was the case with the first theme, the second theme
takes on a strongly emotional tonality for Marcus: we must love other people
with all our hearts, he writes,1°" for rational beings are not only parts of the
same whole, but the limbs of the same body. Moreover, we arc to extend our
love even toward those who commit injustices against us, bearing in mind that
they belong to the same human race as we do, and that, if they sin, they do
so involuntarily, and out of ignorance.105
Marcus differs the least from Epictetus in his presentation of the third
theme, the discipline of assent. The discipline Marcus imposes on himself
relates, however, not only to the inner logos - that is, to the assent we give
to our representations (phantasia1) - but also to the outer logos; that is, our
manner of expressing ourselves.1111• Herc, the fundamental virtue is that of
truth, understood as rectitude of thought and speech. Lies, even when
involuntary, arc the result of the deformation of our faculty of judgment.107
When formulating the triple rule of life, Marcus also likes to insist on the fact
that we must concentrate on the prese111 moment: the present representation, the
present action, and the present inner disposition (whether of desire or of aversion).
We find nothing of the sort in Epictetus, yet Marcus' attitude here is in complete
accord with the fundamental Stoic attitude of attention (prosoche) as directed
toward the present moment. 'Oii Nothing must escape the vigilance of consciousness:
neither our relationship to destiny and the way of the world - this is the
discipline of desire - nor our relationship with our fellow men (discipline of the
active will), nor, finally, our relationship to ourselves (discipline of assent).
Elsewhere, Marcus links the three philosophical exercises to their corresponding
virtues. We thus have the following schema:
Discipline
Of desire
Of inclinations
Of assent
Corresponding virtue
Temperance (sophro�J'1fe); absence of worries (al<1rtu·ia)
Justice (dikaitJ�J'llt')
Truth (11/etl1ei<1); 11hi;cncc of hurry (t1prt1ptosi11).
Marcus Aurelius 1 99
Marcus enumerates the three virtues corresponding to the three disciplines in
the following terms: "Absence of hurry, love of our fellow-men, obedience to
the gods." 109
This vocabulary is totally absent from Epictetus' Discourses. How are we to
explain these differences in the way Marcus and Epictetus present the three
fundamental exercises of philosophy?
In the first place, it seems certain that Marcus possessed more information
about Epictetus' teachings than we do today. In the first book of his
Meditations,1 10 Marcus tells us that he came to know the writings of Epictetus
thanks to Quintus Junius Rusticus, a statesman who had taught Marcus the
fundamentals of Stoic doctrine before going on to become one of his
counsellors. Marcus states that Rusticus loaned him his personal copy of
Epictetus' hypomnemata; that is, a book of notes taken down at his classes.
This statement can be interpreted in two ways:
The book in question could be a copy of the work by Arrian. In the
prefatory letter he placed at the beginning of his edition of Epictetus'
Discourses, Arrian himself describes his work as a collection of hypomnemata:
Whatever I heard him say, I tried to write down, using his very words
as far as possible, so that I should have in the future some "notes
intended to help me remember" [hypomnemata] of his thought and his
frankness. As was to be expected, these notes often have the appearance
of an improvised, spontaneous conversation between two men, not such
as one would write if he was expecting them to be read one day. 1 11
Now, Arrian had come to attend the classes of Epictetus sometime between
AD 107 and 1 09. His prefatory letter to Lucius Gellius was probably
written after Epictetus' death, some time between 1 25 and 1 30, and the
Discourses themselves were published ca. AD 1 30. Aulus Gellius recountsl lZ
that, in the year he spent studying at Athens - around AD 1 40 - he had
been present at a discussion in the course of which the famous millionaire
Herod Atticus had brought to him from a library a copy of what Gellius
refers to as the dissertationes of Epictetus, arrangei:l (digestae) by Arrian. He
also tells how, on the way from Cassiopeia to Brindisium, he came across
a philosopher who had a copy of the same work in his baggage. This shows
that is was at least possible that Marcus read a copy of this book, which
had been loaned to him by Rusticus.
2 We might also consider another suggestion, which has already been
proposed by Farquharson. What Rusticus loaned to Marcus, on this
hypothesis, would have been Rusticus' own notes, which he himself had
taken durinic Epictetus' lectures. From the chronological point of view, if
we Rl'1111t 1 h11t l•:11i,•1ct us died between AD 1 25 and 1 30, and if Rusticus was
200 Figures
born at the beginning of the second century, as we are entitled to deduce
from his official cursus, it would then be entirely possible for Rustious to
have been Epictetus' student. Moreover, it is hard to imagine that there
was no copy of Epictetus' Discourses available in Rome around AD 145-6,
even though the work had been widely diffused in Greece by 140. Besides,
Marcus represents Rusticus' gift as something exceptional; we are thus
entitled to wonder if the gift may not, after all, have been Rusticus' own
notes. It is, moreover, more or less certain that Marcus had read Arrian's
work, since the Meditations are full of literal citations taken from it.
Whether Marcus had read only the Discourses as arranged by Arrian, or
whether he had read Rusticus' notes as well, one thing is beyond doubt:
Marcus was familiar with more texts concerning Epictetus' teaching than we
are today. We possess only a part of Arrian's work; and if Rusticus' notes did
in fact exist, they may well have revealed to Marcus some aspects of
Epictetus' teachings which had not been noted down by Arrian.
It is thanks to Marcus that we know some otherwise unknown fragments
of Epictetus, such as the following: "You are a little soul, bearing the weight
of a dead body." 1 13 This fragment also goes to show that "pessimistic"
features are not exclusively characteristic of Marcus Aurelius, as has often
been claimed. Thus, we may suppose that the differences in presentation of
the three exercises which we find in Marcus and in the extant works of
Epictetus can be explainc:d by the influence of passages of Epictetus which
were known to Marcus, but subsequently were lost.
Finally, we must not forget that there is a profound difference between the
literary genre of Epictetus' Discourses and Marcus Aurelius' Meditations.
Arrian's work, even if it was more extensively rearranged than its author is
willing to admit in his preface, is quite literally a series of Discourses given
before an audience. Their subject-matter was inspired by specific circumstances:
questions directed to the master, or visits of people from outside the
school. The argumentation was adapt<.>d to the capacities of the audience, and
its goal was to persuade them.
By contrast, Marcus wa"> alone with himself. For my part, I cannot discern
in the Meditations the hesitations, contradictions, and strugglings of a man
abandoned to his solitude, which some scholars have thought to detect in
them. 1 1� On the contrary, one is rather astounded by the firmness of thought
and technical nature of the philosophical vocabulary one encounters from
beginning to end of the Meditations. Everything points to the conclusion that
either Marcus had perfectly assimilated the teachings of Rusticus and
Epictetus, or else that he always had Epictetus' own texts at hand, for the
practice of his meditation exercises. One is also astonished, moreover, by the
extraordinary literary quality of the majority of the Medittitions. M11rcus'
former teacher of rhetoric, Fmn10, had tnuicht him how tu finely chiHd his
Marcus Aurelius 201
sentences, and Marcus always sought to give to his thoughts the clarity, rigor,
and striking formulations necessary to give them the sought-after therapeutical
and psychagogic effect. After all, it is not enough merely to repeat some
rational principle to oneself, in order to be persuaded of it;115 everything
depends on how you formulate it. The Meditations have the appearance of
variations, sometimes executed with supreme virtuosity, on a small number of
fundamental themes; indeed, they are variations almost exclusively on the three
themes first taken up by Epictetus. In some passages, such as those we have seen
cited above, the triple schema, enunciating the three philosophical exercises we
must practice at each instant, is presented in its entirety, with only some slight
variations. Elsewhere, only two of the themes, or even a single one, are presented.
As for the variations: sometimes they develop one or another of the three themes,
at other times they set forth motifs associated with these principal themes. For
instance, under the heading of the discipline of desire, we are presented with the
theme of destiny weaving for us in advance all that is going to happen to us;1 16
or a discussion of the "physical" definition of objects;117 the natural character of
the accessory phenomena which accompany natural phenomena;1 18 or the theme
of death. 1 1
9 Under the heading of the second discipline, that of inclinations, we
find the associated themes of love for others,1
2
0 or of rational action. 121
Thus Marcus, in the course of his solitary meditations, was led to
orchestrate and make explicit everything that was implied by the doctrine of
the three disciplines as proposed by Epictetus. Often, Marcus does little more
than expand upon brief notes which were already sketched in the Discourses
arranged by Arrian: this is the case for the theme of joyous satisfaction with
the events willed by universal reason, for example, or with the theme of
obedience to the gods. 1
22
To conclude: each time Marcus wrote down one of his Meditatiom, he knew
exactly what he was doing: he was exhorting himself to practice one of the
disciplines: either that of desire, of action, or of assent. At the same time, he
was exhorting himself to practice philosophy itself, in its divisions of physics,
ethics, and logic.
1 23
Perhaps now we are in a better position to understand what it is that gives
Marcus Aurelius' Meditations the fascinating power· they have exerted over
generations of readers. It is precisely the fact that we have the feeling of
witnessing the practice of spiritual exercises - captured live, so to speak.
There have been a great many preachers, theoreticians, spiritual directors, and
censors in the history of world literature. Yet it is extremely rare to have the
chance to see someone in the process of training himself to be a human being:
"When you have trouble getting up in the morning, let this thought be in
your mind: I'm waking up in order to do a man's work." 124
We have already stressed that Marcus seldom seems to hesitate, stumble,
or foci his way as he practices exercises which follow the directions Epictetus
had skctclml in 1ulv11ncc so precisely. Nonetheless, we feel a quite particular
202 Figures
emotion as we catch a person in the process of doing what we are all trying
to do: to give a meaning to our life, to strive to live in a state of perfect
awareness and to give each of life's instants its full value. To be sure, Marcus
is talking to himself, but we still get the impression that he is talking to each
one of us as well.

Reflections on the Idea of the
"Cultivation of the Self"
In his preface to The Use of Pleasure, as well as in a chapter of The Care of
the Self,1 Michel Foucault made mention of.my article 'Exercices spiritucls',
the first version of which dates back to 1976.2 Foucault seems to have been
particularly interested by the following points, which I developed in this
article: the description of ancient philosophy as an art, style, or way of life;
the attempt I made to explain how modern philosophy had forgotten this
tradition, and had become an almost entirely theoretical discourse; and the
idea I sketched out in the article, and have developed more fully above, that
Christianity had taken over as its own certain techniques of spiritual exercises,
as they had already been practiced in antiquity.
Here, I should like to offer a few remarks with a view to delineating the
differences of interpretation, and in the last analysis of philosophical choice,
which separate us, above and beyond our points of agreement. These
differences could have provided the substance for a dialogue between us,
which, unfortunately, was interrupted all too soon by Foucault's premature
death.
In The Care of the Self, Foucault meticulously describes what he terms the
" practices of the self" (pratiques de soi), recommended in antiquity by Stoic
philosophers. These include the care of one's self, which can only be carried
out under the direction of a spiritual guide; the attention paid to the body
and the soul which the "care of the self" implies; exercises of abstinence;
examination of the conscience; the filtering of representations; and, finally,
the conversion toward and possession of the self. M. Foucault conceives of
these practices as "arts of existence" and "techniques of the self."
I t i s quite true that, in this connection, the ancients did speak of an "art of
living. " It seems to me, however, that the description M. Foucault !(i ves of
what I h11d termed "spi rit ual exercises," anti which he prcfc1·11 111 cilll
Reflections on the Idea of the "Cultivation of the Self" 207
"techniques of the self," is precisely focused far too much on the "self," or at
least on a specific conception of the self.
In particular, Foucault presents Greco-Roman ethics as an ethics of the
pleasure one takes in oneself: "Access to the self is liable to replace this kind
of violent, uncertain, and temporary pleasures with a form of pleasure one
takes in oneself, serenely and forever." 3 To illustrate his point, Foucault cites
Seneca's twenty-third Letter, where he speaks of the joy one can find within
oneself, and specifically within the best portion of oneself. In fact, however,
I must say that there is a great deal of inexactitude in this way of
presenting the matter. In Letter 23, Seneca explicitly opposes voluptas
and gaudium - pleasure and joy - and one cannot, therefore, speak of
"another form of pleasure," as does Foucault (Care of the Self, p. 83)
when talking about joy. This is not just a quibble over words, although
the Stoics did attach a great deal of importance to words, and carefully
distinguished between hedone - "pleasure" - and eupatheia - "joy".4 No,
this is no mere question of vocabulary. If the Stoics insist on the word
gaudimn/"joy," it is precisely because they refuse to introduce the principle
of pleasure into moral life. For them, happiness does not consist in pleasure,
but in virtue itself, which is its own reward. Long before Kant, the
Stoics strove jealously to preserve the purity of intention of the moral
consciousness.
Secondly and most importantly, it is not the case that the Stoic finds his
joy in his "self;" rather, as Seneca says, he finds it "in the best portion of the
self," in "the true good." 5 Joy is to be found "in the conscience turned
towards the good; in intentions which have no other object than virtue; in just
actions." 6 Joy can be found in what Seneca calls "perfect reason"7 (that is to
say, in divine reason)8 since for him, human reason is nothing other than
reason capable of being made perfect. The "best portion of oneself," then, is,
in the last analysis, a transcendent self. Seneca does not find his joy in
"Seneca," but by transcending "Seneca"; by discovering that there is within
him - within all human beings, that is, and within the cosmos itself - a reason
which is a part of universal reason.
In fact, the goal of Stoic exercises is to go beyond the self, and think and
act in unison with universal reason. The three exercises described by Marcus
Aurelius,9 following Epictetus, are highly significant in this regard. As we saw
above, they are as follows:
1 to judge objectively, in accordance with inner reason;
2 to act in accordance with the reason which all human beings have in
common; and
3 to accept the destiny imposed upon us by cosmic reason. For the Stoics,
there is only one single reason at work here, and this reason is man'
s true
Rel f.

I can well understand Foucault's motives for giving short shrift to these
aspects, of which he was perfectly aware. His description of the practices of
the self - like, moreover, my description of spiritual exercises - is not merely
an historical study, but rather a tacit attempt to offer contemporary mankind
a model of life, which Foucault calls "an aesthetics of existence." Now,
according to a more or less universal tendency of modern thought, which is
perhaps more instinctive than reflective, the ideas of "universal reason" and
"universal nature" do not have much meaning any more. It was therefore
convenient to "bracket" them.
For the moment, then, let us say that, from an historical point of view, it
seems difficult to accept that the philosophical practice of the Stoics and
Platonists was nothing but a relationship to one's self, a culture of the self, or
a pleasure taken in oneself. The psychic content of these exercises seems to
me to be something else entirely. In my view, the feeling of belonging to a
whole is an essential element: belonging, that is, both to the whole constituted
by the human community, and to that constituted by the cosmic whole.
Seneca sums it up in four words: Toti se inserens mundo,10 "Plunging oneself
into the totality of the world." In his adminble Anthropo/ogie philosophique,11
Groethuysen pointed out the importance of this fundamental point. Such a
cosmic perspective radically transforms the feeling one has of oneself.
Oddly, Foucault does not have much to say about the Epicureans. This is
all the more surprising in that Epicurean ethics is, in a sense, an ethics
without norms. It is an autonomous ethics, for it cannot found itself upon
nature, which according to its views is the product of chance. It would seem,
therefore, to be an ethics perfectly suited to the modern mentality. Perhaps
the reason for this silence is to be found in the fact that it is rather difficult
to integrate Epicurean hedonism into the overall schema of the use of
pleasures proposed by M. Foucault. Be this as it may, the Epicureans did
make use of spiritual exercises, for instance the examination of conscience. As
we have said, however, these practices are not based on the norms of nature
or universal reason, because for the Epicureans the formation of the world is
the result of mere chance. Nevertheless, here again, this spiritual exercise
cannot be defined simply as culture of the self, a relationship of the self to
the self, or pleasure that can be found in one's own self. The Epicurean was
not afraid to admit that he needed other things besides himself in order to
satisfy his desires and to experience pleasure. He needed bodily nourishment
and the pleasures of love, but he also required a physical theory of the
universe, in order to eliminate the fear of the gods and of death. He needed
the company of the other members of the Epicurean school, so that he could
find happiness in mutual affection. Finally, he needed the imaginative
contemplation of an infinite number of universes in the infinite void, in order
to experience what Lucretius calls tlivi11a vo/uptt1s et lwm1r. MctroJorus, n

in the cosmos: "Remember that, although born mortal with a limited
life-span, you have risen in thought as far as the eternity and infinity of
things, and that you have seen everything that has been, and everything that
shall be." 12 In Epicureanism, there is an extraordinary reversal of perspective.
Precisely because existence seems to the Epicurean to be pure chance,
inexorably unique, he greets life like a kind of miracle, a gratuitous,
unexpected gift of nature, and existence for him is a wonderful celebration.
Let us consider another example to illustrate the differences between our
interpretations of the "care of the self." In an interesting article entitled
"Ecriture de soi," 13 M. Foucault took as his point of departure a remarkable
text concerning the therapeutic value of writing, which I had studied in
Exercices spirituels. 14 According to this text, St Antony used to advise his
disciples to write down their actions and the emotions of their souls, as if they
were going to make them known to others. "Let writing take the place of the
eyes of other people," Antony used to say . This anecdote leads M. Foucault
to reflect on the various forms adopted in antiquity by what he calls the
"writing of the self." In particular, he examines the literary genre of
hypomnemata, which one could translate as "spiritual notebooks," in which
one writes down other people's thoughts, which may serve for the edification
of the person writing them down. Foucault15 describes the goal of this exercise
in the following terms: the point is to "capture what-has-already-been-said
[capter le dijti-dit]," and to "collect what one may have heard or read, with a
view to nothing less than the constitution of the self." He then asks himself,
"How can we be placed in the presence of our selves with the help of ageless
discourses, picked up from any old place?" And he replies as follows: "this
exercise was supposed to allow one to turn back towards the past. The
contribution of the hypomnemala is one of the means by which one detaches
the soul from worries about the future, in order to inflect it toward meditation
on the past." Both in Epicurean and in Stoic ethics, Foucault thinks he
perceives the refusal of a mental attitude directed toward the future, and the
tendency to accord a positive value to the possession of a past which one can
enjoy autonomously and without worries.
It seems to me that this is a mistaken interpretation. It is true that the
Epicureans - and on{v the Epicureans - did consider the memory of pleasant
moments in the past as one of the principal sources of pleasure, but this has
nothing to do with the meditation on "what-has-already-been-said" practiced
in hypomnemala. Rather, as we saw above, 16 Stoics and Epicureans had in
common an attitude which consisted in liberating oneself not only from
worries about the future, but also from the burden of the past, in order to
concentrate on the present moment; in order either to enjoy it, or to act
within it. From this point of view, neither the Stoics nor even the Epicureans
accorded a positive value to the past. The fundamental philosophic attitude
consisted in li1•l1tR ;,, tht flrtsmt, and in possessing not the past, but the
210 Figures
present. That the Epicureans also attached a great deal of importance to the
thoughts formulated by their predecessors is a wholly different matter. But
although hypomnemata deal with what has already been said, they do not deal
with just anything "already said," the only merit of which would be that it is
a part of the past. Rather, it is because one recognizes in this "thing already
said" - which usually consisted in the dogmas of the school's founding
members - that which reason itself has to say to the present. It is because one
recognizes, in the dogmas of Epicurus or Chrysippus, an ever-present value,
precisely because they are the very expression of reason. In other words, when
one writes or notes something down, it is not an alien thought one is making
one's own. Rather, one is utilizing formulae considered as apt to actualize
what is already present within the reason of the person writing, and bring it
to life.
According to M. Foucault, this method made a deliberate attempt to be
eclectic, and therefore implied a personal choice; this then explains the
"constitution of the self."
Writing as a personal exercise, done by oneself and for oneself, is an art
of disparate truth; more precisely, it is a way of combining the
traditional authority of what has already been said, with the singularity
of the truth which asserts itself in it, and the particularity of the
circumstances which determine its utilization.
In fact, however, personal choice is not to be found in eclecticism, at least for
the Stoics and Epicureans. Eclecticism is only used for converting beginners.
At that stage, anything goes. For instance, Foucault finds an example of
eclecticism in the Letters to Lucilius, in which the Stoic Seneca quotes sayings
of Epicurus. The goal of these letters, however, is to convert Lucilius, and to
cause him to begin to lead a moral life. The utilization of Epicurus appears
only in the first Letters, and soon disappears.17 On the contrary, personal
choice in fact intervenes only when'
one adheres exclusively to a precise form
of life, be it Stoicism or Epicureanism, considered as in conformity with
reason. It is only in the New Academy - in the person of Cicero, for instance
- that a personal choice is made according to what reason considers as most
likely at a given moment.
It is thus not the case, as Foucault maintains,18 that the individual forges a
spiritual identity for himself by writing down and re-reading disparate
thoughts. In the first place, as we have seen, these thoughts are not disparate,
but chosen because of their coherence. Secondly, and most importantly, the
point is not to forge oneself a spiritual identity by writing, but rather to
liberate oneself from one's individuality, in order to raise oneself up to
universal ity. It is thus incorrect to speak of "writing of' the 11elf": not only is
it not the case t hat one 11write11 onc11t•lf," hut wh111 iN more, it iN not t he t�llsc
Reflections on the Idea of the "Cultivation of the Self" 2 1 1
that writing constitutes the self. Writing, like the other spiritual exercises,
changes the level of the self. and universalizes it. The miracle of this exercise,
carried out in solitude, is that it allows its practitioner to accede to the
universality of reason within the confines of space and time.
For the monk Antony, the therapeutic value of writing consisted precisely
in its universalizing power. Writing, says Antony, takes the place of other
people's eyes. A person writing feels he is being watched; he is no longer
alone, but is a part of the silently present human community. When one
formulates one's personal acts in writing, one is taken up by the machinery
of reason, logic, and universality. What was confused and subjective becomes
thereby objective.
To summarize: what Foucault calls "practices of the selr' do indeed
correspond, for the Platonists as well as for the Stoics, to a movement of
conversion toward the self. One frees oneself from exteriority, from personal
attachment to exterior objects, and from the pleasures they may provide. One
observes oneself, to determine whether one has made progress in this exercise.
One seeks to be one's own master, to possess oneself, and find one's happiness
in freedom and inner independence. I concur on all these points. I do think,
however, that this movement of interiorization is inseparably linked to another
movement, whereby one rises to a higher psychic level, at which one
encounters another kind of exteriorization, another relationship with "the
exterior." This is a new way of being-in-the-world, which consists in
becoming aware of oneself as a part of nature, and a portion of universal
reason. At this point, one no longer lives in the usual, conventional human
world, but in the world of nature. As we have seen above, 19 one is then
practicing "physics" as a spiritual exercise.
In this way, one identifies oneself with an "Other": nature, or universal
reason, as it is present within each individual. This implies a radical
transformation of perspective, and contains a universalist, cosmic dimension,
upon which, it seems to me, M. FoU<.-ault did not sufficiently insist.
lnteriorization is a going beyond oneself; it is universalization.
The preceding remarks are not intended to be relevant only to an historical
analysis of ancient philosophy. They are also an attempt at defining an ethical
model which modern man can discover in antiquity. What I am afraid of is
that, by focusing his interpretation too exclusively on the culture of the self,
the care of the self, and conversion toward the self - more generally, by
defining his ethical model as an aesthetics of existence - M. Foucault is
propounding a culture of the self which is too aesthetic. In other words, this
may be a new form ofDandyism, late twentieth-century style. This, however,
deserves a more attentive study than I am able to devote to it here. Personally,
I believe firmly - albeit perhaps naively - that it is possible for modern man
to live, nor ns a Rage (.ffJphos) - most of the ancients did not hold this to be
possible hut ''" 11 1m1cti1ioner of t he ever-fragile e.\'ercisc of wisdom. This can

be attempted, starting out from the lived experience of the concrete, living,
and perceiving subject, under the triple form defined, as we saw above, by
Marcus Aurelius:
1 as an effort to practice objectivity of judgment;
2 as an effort to live according to justice, in the service of the human
community; and
3 as an effort to become aware of our situation as a part of the universe. Such
an exercise of wisdom will thus be an attempt to render oneself open to the
universal.
More specifically, I think modern man can practice the spiritual exercises of
antiquity, at the same time separating them from the philosophical or mythic
discourse which came along with them. The same spiritual exercise can, in fact,
be justified by extremely diverse philosophical discourses. These latter are
nothing but clumsy attempts, coming after the fact, to describe and justify inner
experiences whose existential density is not, in the last analysis, susceptible of any
attempt at theorization or systemati7.ation. Stoics and Epicureans, for example -
for completely different reasons - urged their disciples to concentrate their
attention on the present moment, and free themselves from worries about the
future as well as the burden of the past Whoever concretely practices this
exercise, however, sees the universe with new eyes, as if he were seeing it for the
first time. In the enjoyment of the pure present, he discovers the mystery and
splendor of existence. At such moments, as Nietzsche said,20 we say yes "not only
to ourselves, but to all existence." It is therefore not necessary, in order to practice
these exercises, to believe in the Stoics' nature or universal reason. Rather, as one
practices them, one lives concretely according to reason. In the words of Marcus
Aurelius:21 "Although everything happens at random, don't you, too, act
at random." In this way, we <.-an accede concretely to the universality of
the cosmic perspective, and the wonderful mystery of the presence of the
universe.

"Only the Present is our Happiness":
The Value of the Present Instant in
Goethe and in Ancient Philosophy
"Then the spirit looks neither ahead nor behind. Only the present is our
happiness." 1 In this verse from Goethe's Set'ond Fa11st, we find an expression of
the art of concentrating on and recognizing the value of the present instant. It
corresponds to an experience of time which was lived with particular intensity in
such ancient philosophies as Epicureanism and Stoicism, and in what follows we
shall be especially concerned with this type of experience. We ought not,
however, to forget the literary context in which these lines arc spoken, the
meaning they take on within the context of the Second Faw;/, and, more generally,
within the work of Goethe. In the proces.o;, we will find that Goethe himself is a
remarkable witness for the type of experience we have mentioned.
The verses quoted mark one of the climaxes of the Second Fa11s1; a moment when
Faust seems to reach the culminating point of his "quest for the highest existencc." 2
Beside him, on the throne which he has had built for her, sits Helen, whom he had
evoked in the first act, after a terrifying journey to the . realm of the Mothers, in
order to amuse the emperor; but had since fallen hopelessly in love with her:
Has the Source of Beauty, overflowing its banks,
Flowed into the deepest recesses of my being? ...
To you I dedicate the stirring of all strength,
The essence too of passion;
To you, affection, love, worship, and madness.3
It is llcll·n for whom he has searched throughout the second act, throughout
1111 l hl' 111y1 hk11I formN of clntisical G reen·. I le has spoken of her with 1 hc
218 Themes
centaur Chiron, and with Manto the Sibyl, and finally, it is she who, in
the third act, has come to take refuge in the medieval fortress -
perhaps Mistra in the Peloponnese - of which he appears as the lord and
master.
It is then that the extraordinary encounter takes place between Faust
and Helen; Faust, who, although he appears in the guise of a medieval
knight, is really the personification of modern man, and Helen, who, although
she is evoked in the form of the heroine of the Trojan War, is, in fact, the
figure of beauty itself, and in the last analysis of the beauty of nature.
With consummate mastery, Goethe has succeeded in bringing these figures
and symbols to life, in such a way that the encounter between Faust
and Helen is as highly-charged with emotion as the meeting between two
lovers, as laden with historical significance as the meeting between
two epochs, and as full of meaning as the encounter of a human being with
his destiny.
The choice of poetic form is used very skillfully to represent both the
dialogue of the two lovers and the encounter between two historical epochs.
Since the beginning of the third act, Helen had been speaking in the
manner of ancient tragedy, and her words were set to the rhythm of iambic
trimeters, while the chorus of captive Trojan women responded to her in
strophe and antistrophc. Now, however, at the moment when Helen meets
Faust and hears the watchman Lynccus speak in rhymed distichs, she is
astonished and charmed by this unknown poetic form:
No sooner has one word struck the car
Than another comes to caress its predccessor.4
The birth of Helen's love for Faust will, moreover, express itself in the
same rhymed distichs, which Faust begins and Helen finishes, inventing the
rhyme each time. As she learns this new poetic form, Helen learns, as
Phorkyas says, to spell out the alphabet of love.; Helen begins:
Tell me, then, how can I, too, speak so prettily?
"That's easy enough," replies Faust;
It must come from the heart,
And when one's breast with longing overflows,
One looks around, and asks -
llelt'n: who sh11ll enjoy ii w ilh us.
"Only the Present is our Happiness "
Faust begins again:
Now the spirit looks not forward, nor behind
Only the present -
Helen: is our happiness.
219
Faust: It is our treasure, our highest prize, our possession
and our pledge.
But who confirms it?
Helen: My hand.6
The love duet ends, for the moment, with this sign of Helen's yielding, and
the rhyme-play thus ends in a "confinnatio" which is now no longer the echo
of a rhyme, but the gift of a hand. Faust and Helen then fall silent, and
embrace each other without a word, while the chorus, adopting the tone of an
epithalamion, describes their embrace. Then the dialogue of love - and also of
rhyming verses - starts up again between Faust and Helen, and causes us to
live a moment of such intensity and pregnancy that both time and the drama
seem to stop. Helen says:
I feel myself so far away and yet so close;
And I say only too gladly: Here Am I! Here!
Faust: I can scarcely breathe; my words tremble and falter;
This is a dream, and time and place have disappeared.
Helen: It seems to me that I am broken down with age,
and yet I am so new;
Mingled with you, I am faithful to the Unknown.
Faust: Don't rack your brains about your destiny, so unique!
Existence is a duty, be it only for an instant.7
Here the drama seems to stop. We think that Helen and Faust have nothing
left to desire, fulfilled as they are by each other's presence. But Mephistopheles,
who, in order to adapt himself to the Greek world, has taken on the monstrous
mask of Phorkyas, breaks off this perfect moment by announcing the menacing
approach of the troops of Menelaus, and Faust reproaches him for his ill-timed
interruption. The marvelous instant has now disappeared, but the dispositions of
Faust anJ of I lclcn will still be reflected in the deS<.. Tiption of the ideal Arcadia
in which F11UNI 1111J Helen arc to engender Euphorion, the genius of poetry.
220 Themes
The dialogue we have quoted may be understood at several levels. First and
foremost, it is the dialogue between two lovers, who, as such, resemble all lovers
everywhere. Faust and Helen are two lovers absorbed by the living presence of
the beloved: they forget everything - both past and future - which is other than
this presence. Their excess of happiness gives them an impression of dreamlike
unreality: time and space disappear. We are entering the unknown, and it is the
moment of love fulfilled.
On a second level of interpretation, however, the dialogue takes place
between Faust and Helen as symbolic figures, representing, on the one hand,
modem man in his ceaseless striving, and on the other, ancient beauty in its
soothing presence; both are miraculously reunited by the magic of poetry,
which abolishes the centuries. In this dialogue, Faust as modern man tries to
make Helen forget her past, so that she may be wholly in the present instant,
which she is incapable of understanding. She feels herself to be so distant and
yet so close, abandoned by life and yet in the process of rebirth, living in
Faust, mingled with him, and trusting in the unknown. Faust asks her not to
reflect upon her strange destiny, but to accept the new existence which is
being offered to her. In this dialogue between two symbolic figures, Helen
becomes "modernized," if one may say so; as she adopts rhyme, the symbol
of modern interiority, she has doubts, and reflects upon her destiny. At the
same time, Faust becomes "antiquated": he speaks as a man of antiquity,
when he urges Helen to concentrate on the present moment, and not to lose
it in hesitant reflection on the past and the future. As Goethe said in a letter
to Zelter, this was the characteristic feature of ancient life and art: to know
how to live in the present, and to know what he called "the healthiness of the
moment." In antiquity, says Goethe, the instant was "pregnant;" in other
words, filled with meaning, but it was also lived in all its reality and the
fullness of its richness, sufficient unto itself. We no longer know how to live
in the present, continues Goethe. For us, the ideal is in the future, and can
only be the object of a sort of nostalgic desire, while the present is considered
trivial and banal. We no longer know how to profit from the present; we no
longer know - as the Greeks did - how to act in the present, and upon the
present.8 Indeed, if Faust speaks to Helen as a man of the ancient world, it is
precisely because the presence of Helen - that is, the presence of ancient
beauty - reveals to him what presence itself is: the presence of the world,
"That splendid feeling of the present" (He"liches Gefiihl der Gegenwart) as
Goethe wrote in the East-West Divan.9
This, finally, is the reason why the dialogue can be understood at a third
level. Here, it is no longer the dialogue of two lovers, nor of two historical
figures, but rather the dialogue of man with himself. The encounter with
Helen is not only the encounter with ancient beauty emanating from nature;
it is also the encounter wit h n living wisdom 1md art of living: that
"hcnhhincss of t he moment " which we mt•nt lnncd nhovc. The nlhili111 Fnust
"Only the Present is our Happiness " 221
had wagered with Mephistopheles that he would never say to an instant:
"Stay, you are so beautiful!" But now, following after humble Gretchen, it is
ancient, noble Helen who reveals to him the splendor of being - that is, of
the present instant - and teaches him to say yes to the world and to himself.
We must now define the ancient experience of time which we saw expressed
in the above-quoted verses from Faust. Basing ourselves on the letter from
Goethe to Zeller we cited above, we might think that we have to do with a
generalized, common experience of ancient man, and that it was natural for
ancient man to be familiar with what Goethe calls the "healthiness of the
moment." Moreover, following Goethe, many historians and philosophers,
from Oswald Spengler10 to the logician Hintikka, 11 have alluded to the fact
that the Greeks "lived in the present moment" more than did the representatives
of other cultures. In his book Die Zauberflote,12 Siegfried Morenz
gives a good summary of this conception: "No one has better characterized
the particular nature of Greece than Goethe ... in the dialogue between
Faust and Helen: ' ... then the spirit looks neither backwards nor ahead. Only
the present is our happiness. ' "
We must certainly agree that the Greeks in general gave particular attention
to the present moment, and this attention could take on several different
ethical and artistic meanings. Popular wisdom advised people both to be
content with the present, and to know how to utilize it. Being content with
the present meant, on the one hand, being content with earthly existence.
This is what Goethe admired in ancient art, particularly in funerary art,
where the deceased was represented not with his eyes raised toward the
heavens, but in the act of living his daily life. On the other hand, knowing
how to utilize the present meant knowing how to recognize and seize the
favorable and decisive instant (kairos). Kairos designated all the possibilities
contained within a given moment: a good general, for example, knows how to
strike at the opportune kairos, and sculptors fix in marble the most significant
kairos of the scene which they wish to bring to life.
It does seem, then, that the Greeks paid particular attention to the present
moment. This, however, does not justify us in imagining - as did Winckelmann,
Goethe, and Holderlin - the existence of an idealized Greece, the
citizens of which, because they lived in the present moment, were perpetually
bathed in beauty and serenity. As a matter of fact, people in antiquity were
just as filled with anguish as we are today, and ancient poetry often preserves
the echo of this anguish, which sometimes goes as far as despair. Like us, the
ancients bore the burden of the past, the uncertainty of the future, and the
fear of death. Indeed, it was for this human anguish that ancient philosophies
- particularly F.picurcanism and Stoicism - sought to provide a remedy.
These philo!IUllhics were therapies, intended to provide a cure for anguish,
and to hrintc f'rt•t•dom and sel f-mastery, and their goal was to allow people to
222 Themes
free themselves from the past and the future, so that they could live within
the present. Here we have to do with an experience of time wholly different
from the common, general experience we have been describing. As we shall
see, this experience corresponds precisely to that expressed in the verses from
Faust: "Only the present is our happiness ... don't think about your destiny.
Existence is a duty." We are dealing with a philosophical conversion,
implying a voluntary, radical transformation of one's way of living and
looking at the world. This is the true "healthiness of the moment," which
leads to serenity.
Despite the profound differences between Epicurean and Stoic doctrine, we
find an extraordinary structural analogy between the experiences of time as it was
lived in both schools. This analogy will perhaps allow us to glimpse a certain
common experience of the present underlying their doctrinal divergences. We
can define this analogy as follows: both Epicureanism and Stoicism privilege the
present, to the detriment of the past and above all of the future. They posit as
an axiom that happiness can only be found in the present, that one instant of
happiness is equivalent to an eternity of happiness, and that happiness can and
must be found immediately, here and now. Both Epicureanism and Stoicism
invite us to rcsituate the present instant within the perspective of the cosmos, and
to accord infinite value to the slightest moment of existence.
To begin with Epicureanism: it is a therapy of anguish, and a philosophy
which seeks, above all, to procure peace of mind. Its goal is consequently to
liberate mankind from everything that is a cause of anguish for the soul: the
belief that the gods are concerned with mankind; the fear of post-mortem
punishment; the worries and pain brought about by unsatisfied desires; and
the moral uneasiness caused by the concern to act out of perfect purity of
intention.
Epicureanism does away with all this. With regard to the gods, it affirms
that they themselves live in perfect tranquillity. They are not troubled by the
worry of producing or governing the universe, since the latter is the result of
a fortuitous coming together of eternally existent atoms. With regard to death,
Epicureanism asserts that the soul docs not survive the body, and that death
is not an event within life. With regard to desires, it affirms that they trouble
us to the extent that they are artificial and useless. We must reject all those
desires which are neither natural nor necessary, and satisfy - with prudence
- those of our desires which are natural but not necessary. Above all, we are
to satisfy those desires which are indispensable for the continuation of our
existence. As for moral worries, they will be completely appea.o;ed once we
realize that man, like all other living beings, is always motivated by pleasure.
If we seek for wisdom, this is simply because it brings peace of mind: in other
words, a pleasurable state.
What Epicureanism proposes is a fom1 of wisdom, which tc11chcs Uli how
to relax and to suppre11s our worries. This only appc11rs to be easy, mcll'covcr;
"Only the Present is our Happiness" 223
for we must renounce a great deal, in order that we may desire only that
which we are certain of obtaining, and submit our desires to the judgment of
reason. What is required, in fact, is a total transformation of our lives, and
one of the principal aspects of this transformation is the change of our attitude
toward time. According to Epicureanism, senseless people - that is, the
majority of mankind - are tormented by vast, hollow desires which have to
do with wealth, glory, power, and the unbridled pleasures of the flesh.13 What
is characteristic of all these desires is that they cannot be satisfied in the
present. This is why, for the Epicureans,
senseless people live in hope for the future, and since this cannot be
certain, they are consumed by fear and anxiety. Their torment is the
most intense when they realize too late that they have striven in vain
after money or power or glory, for they do not derive any pleasure from
the things which, inflamed with hope, they had undertaken such great
labors to procure. H
According to an Epicurean saying, "The life of a foolish man is fearful and
unpleasant; it is swept totally away into the future." 15 Thus, Epicurean
wisdom proposes a radical transformation, which must be active at each
instant of life, of mankind's attitude toward time. We must, it teaches, learn
how to enjoy the pleasure of the present, without letting ourselves be
distracted from it. If the past is unpleasant to us, we are to avoid thinking
about it, and we must not think about the future, insofar as the idea of it
provokes in us fears or unbridled expectations. Only thoughts about what is
pleasant - of pleasure, whether past or future - are to be allowed into the
present moment, especially when we are trying to compensate for current
suffering. This transformation presupposes a specific conception of pleasure,
peculiar to Epicureanism, according to which the quality of pleasure depends
neither on the quantity of desires it satisfies, nor on the length of time it lasts.
The quality of pleasure does not depend on the quantity of desires it
satisfies. The best and most intense pleasure is that which is mixed to the
least extent with worry, and which is the most certain to ensure peace of
mind. It can therefore be procured by the satisfaction of natural and necessary
desires; that is, those desires which are essential and necessary for the
preservation of existence. Now, such desires can easily be satisfied, without
our having to rely on the future for them, and without our being exposed to
the worry and uncertainty of lengthy pursuit. "Thanks be to blessed nature,
who made necessary things easy to obtain, and things which are hard to obtain
unnecessary." 111
What causes us to think about the past or the future are such illnesses of
the soul llN 1 hc human passions, desires for wealth, power, or depravity; but
the purc111 , 11111111 in1 cni;c pleasure can easily be obtained within the present.
224 Themes
Not only does pleasure not depend upon the quantity of satisfied desires, but -
above all - it does not depend upon duration. It has no need to be long-lasting
in order to be perfect: "An infinite period of time could not cause us more
pleasure than can be derived from this one, which we can see is finite." 17
"Finite time and infinite time bring us the same pleasure, if we measure its
limits by reason." 18 This may seem paradoxical, but it is founded on a
theoretical conception. As the Stoics were to repeat, a tiny circle is no more
of a circle than a large one. 19 The Epicureans thought of pleasure as a reality
in and for itself, not situated within the category of time. Aristotle had said
that pleasure is total and complete at each moment of its duration, and that
its prolongation does not change its essence.2° For the Epicureans, a practical
attitude is joined to this theoretical representation: if pleasure limits itself to
that which procures perfect peace of mind, it attains a summit which cannot
be surpassed, and it is impossible for it to by increased by duration. In the
words of Guyau: "In enjoyment, there is a kind of inner plenitude and
over-abundance which makes it independent of time, as well as of everything
else. True pleasure bears its infinity within itself." 21
Thus, pleasure is wholly within the present moment, and we need not wait
for anything from the future to increase it. Everything we have been saying
so far could be summed up in the following verses from Horace: "Let the soul
which is happy with the present learn to hate to worry about what lies
ahead." 22 The happy mind does not look towards the future. If we limit our
desires in a reasonable way, we can be happy right now. Not only can we be
happy, but we mus/: happiness must be found immediately, here and now,
and in the present. Instead of reflecting about our lives as a whole, calculating
our hopes and worries, we must seize happiness within the present moment.
The matter is urgent; in the words of an Epicurean saying:
We are only born once - twice is not allowed - and it is necessary
that we shall be no more, for all eternity; and yet you, who are not
master of tomorrow, you keep on putting off your joy? Yet life is vainly
consumed in these delays, and each of us dies without ever having
known peace. 23
Once again, we find the echo of this idea in Horace: "While we are talking,
jealous time has fled. So seize the day [carpe diem], and put no trust
in tomorrow." H Horace's carpe diem is by no means, as is often believed,
the advice of a sensualist playboy; on the contrary, it is an invitation
to conversion. We are invited to become aware of the vanity of our immensely
vain desires, at the same time as of the imminence of death, the
uniqueness of life, and the uniqueness of the present instant. From this
perspective, each instant appears as a marvclom1 gift which fillH itR recipient
with gratitude:
"Only the Present is our Happiness " 225
Believe that each new day that dawns will be the last for you:
Then each unexpected hour shall come to you as a delightful gift. 25
There is perhaps an echo here of the Epicurean Philodemus: "Receive each
additional moment of time in a manner appropriate to its value; as if one were
having an incredible stroke of luck." 26
We have already encountered the Epicureans' feelings of gratitude and
astonishment, in the context of the miraculous coincidence between the needs
of living beings and the facilities provided for them by nature. The secret of
Epicurean joy and serenity is to live each instant as if it were the last, but also
as if it were the first. We experience the same grateful astonishment when we
accept the instant as though it were unexpected, or by greeting it as entirely
new: "If the whole world were appear to mortals now, for the first time; if it
was suddenly and unexpectedly exposed to their view; what could one think
of more marvelous than these things, and which mankind would less have
dared to believe?" 27 In the last analysis, the secret of Epicurean joy and
serenity is the experience of infinite pleasure provided by the consciousness
of existence, even if it be only for a moment. In the words of an Epicurean
saying: "The cry of the flesh is: Not to be hungry, not to be thirsty, not to
be cold. Whoever has these things, and hopes to keep on having them, can
rival in happiness with Zeus himself." 28 The lack of hunger and thirst is thus
the condition for being able to continue to exist, being conscious of existing,
and enjoying this consciousness of existing. God has nothing more than this.
It could be objected that God's pleasure consists in his knowledge that he has
the happiness of existing forever. Not so, replies Epicurus; for the pleasure of
one instant of existence is just as total and complete as a pleasure of infinite
duration, and man is just as immortal as God, because death is not a part of
life.2'1
In order to show that one single instant of happiness is enough to give such
infinite pleasure, the Epicureans practiced telling themselves each day: "I
have had all the pleasure I could have expected." In the words of Horace: "He
will be master of himself and live joyfully who can say, every day: 'I have
lived.' " ·10 Seneca also takes up this Epicurean theme:
When we are about to go to sleep, let us say in joyous cheerfulness: "I
have lived; I have travelled the route that fortune had assigned to me."
If God should grant us tomorrow as well, let us accept it joyfully. That
person is most happy and in tranquil possession of himself who awaits
tomorrow without worries.31 Whoever says: "I have lived", gets up every
day to receive unexpected riches.32
We c11n Rhm sec here the role played in Epicureanism by the thought of
deat h. T11 1111y, cn•ry c\•cning: " I have lived," is to say "my life is over." It is
226 Themes
to practice the same exercise as that which consists in saying: "Today will be
the last day of my life." Yet it is precisely this exercise of becoming aware of
life's finitude which reveals the infinite value of the pleasure of existing within
the present instant. From the point of view of death, the mere fact of existing
- even if only for a moment - seems to be of infinite value, and gives us
pleasure of infinite intensity. Only once we have become aware of the fact that
we have already - in one instant of existence - had everything there was to
be had, can we say with equanimity: "my life is over."
It is here, moreover, that the cosmic perspective comes into play. The
Epicureans had their own particular vision of the universe. As Lucretius
put it: thanks to the doctrine of Epicurus, which explained the origin of
the universe by the fall of atoms in a void, the walls of the world burst
open for the Epicurean: he saw all things come into being within the
immense void,33 and traversed the immensity of the all. Alternatively, he
exclaims, in the words of Metrodorus: "Remember that, born a mortal,
with a limited life-span, you have risen up in soul to eternity and the
infinity of things, and that you have seen all that has been and all that shall
be." 34 Here again, we encounter the contrast between finite and infinite time.
Within finite time, the sage grasps all that takes place within infinite time, or
as Leon Robin puts it in his commentary on Lucretius: "The sage places
himself within the immutability of eternal Nature, which is independent of
time." 35
Thus, the sage perceives the totality of the cosmos within his consciousness
of the fact of existing. Nature gives him everything within an instant, and
since she has already given him everything, she has nothing left to give him,
as she says in Lucretius' poem: "You must always expect the same things,
even though the span of your life should triumph over all the ages; nay, even
were you never to die." ·11•
The fundamental attitude that the Stoic must maintain at each instant of his
life is one of attention, vigilance, and continuous tension, concentrated
upon each and every moment, in order not to miss anything which is contrary
to reason. We find an excellent description of this attitude in Marcus
Aurelius:
Here is what is enough for you:
1. the judgment you are bringing to bear at this moment upon reality,
as long as it is objective;
2. the action you are carrying out at this moment, as long as it is
accomplished in the service of the human community; and
3. the inner disposition in which you find yourself at this moment , as
long as it is a d isposition of joy in the face of the conjunction of events
caused by cx1 rnncom1 cnus11lity.11
"Only the Present is our Happiness " 227
Thus, Marcus used to train himself to concentrate upon the present moment;
that is, upon what he was thinking, doing, and feeling within the present
instant. "This is enough for you," he tells himself, and the expression has a
double meaning:
It is enough to keep you busy; you have no need to think about anything
else; and
2 It is enough to make you happy; there is no need to seek for anything else.
This is the spiritual exercise Marcus himself calls "delimiting the present." 38
Delimiting the present means turning one's attention away from the past and
the future, in order to concentrate it upon what one is in the process of doing.
The present of which Marcus speaks is a present delimited by human
consciousness. The Stoics distinguished two ways of defining the present.39 The
first consisted in understanding the present as the limit between the past and the
future: from this point of view, no present time ever actually exists, since time is
infinitely divisible. This, however, is an abstract, quasi-mathematical division,
with the present being reduced to an infinitesimal instant.
The second way consisted in defining the present with reference to human
consciousness. In this case, the present represented a certain "thickness" of
time, corresponding to the attention-span of lived consciousness. When
Marcus advises us to "delimit the present," he is talking about this lived
present, relative to consciousness. This is an important point: the present is
defined by its reference to man's thoughts and actions.
The present suffices for our happiness, because it is the only thing which
belongs to us, and depends upon us. For the Stoics, it was essential to
distinguish between what does and does not depend upon us. The past does
not belong to us, since it is definitively fixated, and the future does not
depend on us, because it docs not yet exist. Only the present depends on us,
and it is therefore the only thing which can be either good or bad, since it is
the only thing which depends upon our will. Since the past and the future do
not depend on us, they do not come under the category of moral good or evil,
and must therefore be indifferent to us.�0 It is a waste of time to worry about
what is long gone, or what will perhaps never occur; we must therefore
"delimit the present." "All the happiness you are trying to achieve by long,
roundabout ways: you can have it all right now .... that is, if you leave
everything past behind you, entrust the future to providence, and if you
arrange the present in accordance with piety and justice. " �1
Elsewhere, Marcus describes the exercise of delimiting the present in the
following terms:
if you licpnrntc from yourself, that is, from your thought ... everything
you h11\'l' 1111id or done in the past, everything that disturbs you about
228 Themes
the future; all that ... attaches itself to you against your will ... if you
separate from yourself the future and the past, and apply yourself
exclusively to living the life that you are living - that is to say, the
present - you can live all the time that remains to you until your death,
in calm, benevolence, and serenity.0
Seneca describes the same exercise as follows:
Two things must be cut short:43 the fear of the future and the memory
of past discomfort; the one does not concern me any more, and the other
does not concern me yet.44
The sage enjoys the present without depending on the future ....
Liberated from the burden of worries which torture the mind, he does
not hope for or desire anything. He does not plunge forward into the
unknown, for he is happy with what he has [i.e. the present, which is
all that belongs to us]. And don't believe that he is content with not very
much, for what he has is everything.45
Here we witness the same transformation of the present that we encountered
in Epicureanism. In the present, say the Stoics, we have everything, and only
the present is our happiness. There are two reasons why the present is
sufficient for our happiness: in the first place, Stoic happiness - like
Epicurean pleasure - is complete at every instant and does not increase over
time. The second reason is that we already possess the whole of reality within
the present instant, and even infinite duration could not give us more than
what we have right now.
Happiness, then - that is, for the Stoics, moral action or virtue - is always
total and complete, at each moment of its duration. Like pleasure for the
Epicurean sage, the happiness of the Stoic sage is perfect. It lacks nothing,
just as a circle, whether it is large or small, still remains a circle. The same is
true of a propitious or opportune moment or favorable opportunity: it is an
instant, the perfection of which depends not on its duration, but rather on its
quality, and the harmony which exists between one's exterior situation and
the possibilities that one has.46 Happiness is nothing more nor less than that
instant in which man is wholly in accord with nature.
Just as was the case for the Epicureans, one instant of happiness is,
according to the Stoics, equivalent to an eternity. In the words of Chrysippus:
"If a person has wisdom for one instant, he is no less happy than he who
possesses it for an eternity." 47 Similarly, as for the Epicureans, so for the
Stoics: we will never be happy if we arc not so right now. I t's now or never.

"Only tire Present is our Happiness" 229
of no use. What is needed is the immediate transformation of our way of
thinking, of acting, and of accepting events. We must think in accordance with
truth, act in accordance with justice, and lovingly accept what comes to pass. In
the words of Marcus Aurelius: "How easy it is to find oneself, right away, in a
state of perfect peace of mind." 411 In other words, it is enough just to want it.
For the Stoics, as for the Epicureans, it is the imminence of death which
gives the present instant its value. "We must carry out each action of our lives
as if it were the last." 49 This is the secret of concentration on the present
moment: we are to give it all its seriousness, value, and splendor, in order to
show up the vanity of all that we pursue with so much worry: all of which,
in the end, will be taken away from us by death. We must live each day with
a consciousness so acute, and an attention so intense, that we can say to
ourselves each evening: "I have lived; I have actualized my life, and have had
all that I could expect from life." In the words of Seneca: "He has peace of
mind who has lived his entire life every day. 11 5o
We have just seen the first reason why the present alone is sufficient for
our happiness: namely, that one instant of happiness is equivalent to a whole
eternity of happiness. The second reason is that, within one instant, we
possess the totality of the universe. The present instant is fleeting - Marcus
insists strongly on this point51 - but even within this flash, as Seneca says,
"we can proclaim, along with God: 'all this belongs to me.' 11 52 The instant is
our only point of contact with reality, yet it offers us the whole of reality;
precisely because it is a passage and a metamorphosis, it allows us to
participate in the overall movement of the event of the world, and the reality
of the world's coming-to-be.
In order to understand the preceding, we must bear in mind what moral
action, virtue, and wisdom meant for the Stoics. Moral good - for the Stoics,
the only kind of good there is - has a cosmic dimension: it is the
harmonization of the reason within us with the reason w�ich guides the
cosmos, and produces the chain of causes and effect which makes up fate. At
each moment, we must harmonize our judgment, action, and desires with
universal reason. In particular, we must joyfully accept the conjunction of
events which results from the course of nature. At each instant, we must
therefore resituate ourselves within the perspective of universal reason, so
that, at each instant, our consciousness may become a cosmic consciousness.
Thus, if one lives in accord with universal reason, at each instant his
consciousness expands into the infinity of the cosmos, and the entire universe
is present to him. For the Stoics, this is possible because there is a total
mixture and mutual implication of everything with everything else: Chrysippus,
for example, spoke of a drop of wine being mixed with the whole of the
sea, and spreading to the entire world.53 "He who sees the present moment
secs all thnr hns happened from all eternity, and all that will happen
throuichoul infinill' l ime. 11 �� This explains the attention given to each current
230 Themes
event, and to what is happening to us at each instant. Each event implies the
entire world: "Whatever happens to you has been prepared for you from all
eternity, and the mutual linkage of cause and effect has, from all eternity,
woven together your existence and the occurrence of this event." 55
One could speak here of a mystical dimension of Stoicism. At each moment
and every instant, we must say "yes" to the universe; that is, to the will of
universal reason. We must want that which universal reason wants: that is,
the present instant, exactly as it is. Some Christian mystics have also
described their state as a continuous consent to the will of God. Marcus, for
his part, cries out: "I say to the universe: 'I love along with you.' " 56 We have
here a profound feeling of participation and identification; of belonging to a
whole which transcends our individual limits, and gives us a feeling of
intimacy with the universe. For Seneca, the sage plunges himself into the
whole of the universe (toti se inserens mundo).57
Because the sage lives within his consciousness of the world, the world is
constantly present to him. In Stoicism, even more than in Epicureanism, the
present moment takes on an infinite value: it contains within it the entire
cosmos, and all the value and wealth of being.
It is quite remarkable that the two schools of Stoicism and Epicureanism,
in other respects so opposed, should both place the concentration of
consciousness upon the present moment at the very center of their way of life.
The difference between the two attitudes consists only in the fact that the
Epicurean enjoys the present moment, whereas the Stoic wills it intensely; for
the one, it is a pleasure; for the other, a duty.
Our scene from Faust echoes this double motif in two key phrases: "Only the
present is our happiness," and "Existence is a duty." SR
In his conversations with Falk,.�1 Goethe had spoken of certain beings who, by
virtue of their innate tendencies, arc half Stoic and half Epicurean. He found
nothing surprising, he said, in the fact that they accepted the fundamental
principles of the two systems at the same time, and even that they tried to unite
them as far as was possible. One might say that Goethe himself, in his way of
living the present moment, was also "half Stoic and half Epicurean." He enjoyed
the present moment like an Epicurean, and willed it intensely like a Stoic.
In Goethe, we re-encounter most of the themes we have enumerated above;
in particular, the delimitation of the present followed by expansion into the
totality of the cosmos, which we observed in Epicureanism and in Stoicism.
In this regard, Goethe could have mentioned an opposition that was dear to
him: that between "systole" and "diastole."
First of all, let us consider concentration on and delimitation of the present.
In moments of happiness, these processes take place spontaneously: "Then
the spirit looks neither forward nor behind." This verse from Faust is ed10ed
by a poem dedicated to Count Puar:w
"Only the Present is our Happiness "
Happiness looks neither forward nor backwards;
And thus the instant becomes eternal.
23 1
The present instant is perceived as a grace which is accorded us, or an
opportunity we are offered.
The mind may also, however, turn voluntarily away from the past and the
future, in order to more fully enjoy the present state of reality. Such is the
attitude of Goethe's Egmont:61
Do I live only in order to think about life? Must I prevent myself from
enjoying the present moment, that I may be sure of the one that follows,
and then waste that one, too, in cares and useless worries? . . . Does the
sun illuminate me today, that I may ponder what happened yesterday?
That I may guess at and arrange that which cannot be guessed nor
arranged: the fate of the oncoming day?
This is the same secret of happiness which Goethe formulated in the "Rule
of Life":6
2
Would you model for yourself a pleasant life?
Worry not about the past
Let not anger get the upper hand
Rejoice in the present without ceasing
Hate no man ....
And the future? Abandon it to God.
This is the height of wisdom; the wisdom of the child in the Marienbad
Elegy:63
Hour by hour, life is kindly offered us
We have learned but little from yesterday
Of tomorrow, all knowledge is forbidden,
And if I ever feared the coming evening, ·
The setting sun still saw what brought me joy.
Do like me, then: with joyful wisdom
Look the instant in the eye! Do not delay!
Hurry! Run to greet it, lively and benevolent,
Be it for action, for joy or for love!
Wherever you may be, be like a child, wholly and always;
Then you will be the All; and invincible.
The "rule of life" - that "high wisdom" - consists in looking neither
forwnrd 1101· hehind, but in becoming aware of the uniqueness and
232 Themes
incomparable value of the present. In Goethe, then, we find the same exercise
of delimitation of the present that we had encountered in ancient philosophy.
This exercise is, however, inseparable from another exercise, which
consists in becoming aware of the inner richness of the present, and of the
totality contained within the instant. By delimiting the present, consciousness,
far from shrinking, swells to fill the dimensions of the world; for that
vision which "looks the instant in the eye" is the disinterested vision of
the artist, the poet, and the sage, which is interested in reality for its own
sake.
Enjoying the present, without thinking about the past or the future,
does not mean living in total instantaneousness. Thoughts about the past and
the future are to be avoided only insofar as rehashing past defeats,
and cowering in fear of future difficulties, can cause distractions,
worries, hopes, or despair, which turn our attention away from the present,
where it ought to be concentrated. When we do concentrate our attention on
the future, however, we discover that the present itself contains both the past
and the future, insofar as it is the genuine passage within which the action
and movement of reality are carried out. It is this past and this future which
are seized by the artist's vision, in the instant which he chooses to describe
or to reproduce. The artists of antiquity, says Goethe, knew how to
choose the "pregnant" instant, heavy with meaning, "which marks
a decisive turning-point between time and eternity." "' To use one of
Goethe's favorite terms, such instants "symbolize" an entire past, and an
entire future.
Likewise, when an artist seizes an instant of the movement of a dancer,
it allows us to glimpse both the "before" and the "after": "The
marvelous suppleness with which a dancer moves from one figure to
another, and provokes our admiration in the face of such artistry: it is
fixated for a moment, so that wc can see, simultaneously, the past, the
present and the future, and wc are thus transported into a supra terrestrial
state." 65
Whoever practices the art of living must also recognize that each instant
is pregnant: heavy with meaning, it contains both the past and the future;
not only of the individual, but also of the cosmos in which he is
plunged. This is what Goethe gives us to understand in his poem "The
Testament:""'
Let reason be present everywhere
Where life rejoices in life.
This point at which life rejoices in life iK nothing other thnn t he prcitcnt
instnnt. "Then," cont in ucN Goet he,
"Only the Present is our Happiness "
the past has gained steadfastness
The present is alive beforehand,
The Instant is eternity.
233
Goethe is even more explicit on this point in one of his conversations with
Eckermann:67 "Hold fast to the present. Every circumstance, every instant is
of infinite value, for it is the representative of an entire eternity."
Some commentators have believed they could explain Goethe's conception
of the instant as eternity by Neoplatonic or Pietistic influence.68 It is true that
we do find within these traditions the representation of God as eternal
present; but such a conception is not to be found in Goethe's writings. When
Goethe speaks of the eternal in his poem entitled "Testament," for example,
he is talking about the eternity of the cosmic process of becoming:
Throughout all things, the Eternal pursues its course . . . .
Being is eternal, for laws
Protect the living treasures
With which the All adorns itself.
In order to explain the Goethean notion of the instant as representative of
eternity, we must rather think of the Epicurean and Stoic tradition of
which I have spoken above. This tradition affirmed, in the first place, that
one instant of happiness is equivalent to an eternity; and, secondly, that one
instant of existence contains the whole eternity of the cosmos. In Goethean
terms, this second idea could be expressed by saying that the instant is the
symbol of eternity. Goethe defined the symbol as "the living, instantaneous
revelation of the unexplorable," 69 but we could just as well define the
instant as "the living symbol of the unexplorable." The idea of the
"unexplorable" corresponds to what, for Goethe, is the inexpressible mystery
at the basis of nature and of all reality. It is its very fleetingness and perishable
nature that make the instant the symbol of eternity, because its ephemeral
nature reveals the eternal movement and metamorphosis which is, simultaneously,
the eternal presence of being: "All that· is perishable is only a
symbol." 70
It is here that the thought of death comes into play, for life itself is
perpetual metamorphosis, and, inseparably, the death of every instant.
Sometimes, for Goethe, this theme takes on a mystical tone:
In order to find himself in the Infinite
The individual willingly accepts to disappear.
It is a pleasure to abandon oneself.71
l would 1m1i11&: the l iving creature who aspires to death in the flame.72
234 Themes
In the last analysis, then, it is eternity - that is, the totality of being - which
gives the present moment its value, meaning, and pregnancy. "If the eternal
remains present to us at each instant, we do not suffer from the fleetingness
of time." 73 The ultimate meaning of Goethe's attitude toward the present is
thus, as it was for ancient philosophy, the happiness and the duty of existing
in the cosmos. It is a profound feeling of participation in and identification
with a reality which transcends the limits of the individual. "Great is the joy
of existence, and greater yet the joy we feel in the presence of the world." 7�
"Throughout all things, the Eternal pursues its course. Hold on to Being with
delight!" 75
We ought here to cite the entire song of the watchman Lynceus near the
end of the Second Faust:
In all things, I see
The eternal adornment,
And since it pleases me,
I please myself as well.
You, my happy eyes: ·
Whatever you have seen,
Be it what it may,
It certainly was beautiful.71•
In his work on Winckelmann, Goethe presents this wonderstruck consent
to being - to the being of the entire cosmos - as characteristic of the ancient
soul.
If man feels at home in the world as within an All, an All which is great,
beautiful, noble and precious; if the pleasure of living in harmony with
this All gives him a pure, free delight, then the universe - if it could be
conscious of itself - would exult with joy; it would have attained its goal,
and would be amazed at this summit of its becoming and its being. After
all, what good is all this profligate abundance of suns, planets, moons,
stars, Milky Ways, comets, nebula, worlds in the process of becoming
and which have come to be, if, when all is said and done, one happy
man does not rejoice, unconsciously, in his own existence?77
When Goethe says "unconsciously," he means that the reasons why people
may be happy, and may be in harmony with the universe, arc unknown and
completely incomprehensible to them. Here we come across another case of
the "unexplorable," 78 to use one of Goethe's favorite expressions. Y ct the
innocent joy of existing, and the spontaneous, unrcflccting pleasure which
living beings take in existence, arc an original phenomenon which reveals the
presence of 1m uncxplorahlc my11tcry : "The child iN plcni;cd by l ht• cnkc,
"Only the Present is our Happiness " 235
without knowing anything about the pastry-cook; and starlings like cherries,
without them stopping to think about where they came from." 79
We again find this "yes" to the world and consent to being in the following
passage from Nietzsche, whatever reservations about it he himself may have had:
Let us assume we say "Yes!" to one single, unique moment: we have
thus said yes, not only to ourselves, but to the whole of existence. For
nothing is isolated, neither in ourselves nor in things. And if, even once,
our soul has vibrated and resounded like a string with happiness, all
eternity was necessary to create the conditions for this one event; and
all eternity has been approved, redeemed, justified, and affirmed.80
Not long ago, Georges Friedmann courageously denounced the tragic lack of
balance which has come about in the modern world between "power" and
"wisdom." 81 If we have chosen here to present some aspects of one of the
fundamental themes of the European spiritual tradition, it was not in order
to satisfy some historical or literary curiosity, but to describe a spiritual
attitude: an attitude which, for ourselves and for modern man in general,
hypnotized as we arc by language, images, information, and the myth of the
future, seemed to us to provide one of the best means of access to this
wisdom, so misunderstood and yet so necessary. The call of Socrates speaks
to us more now than ever before: "Take care for yourself." 82 This call is
echoed by Nietzsche's remark: "Is it not the case that all human institutions"
- to which we might add: "as well as the whole of modern life'' - are intended
to prevent mankind from feeling their life, by means of the constant
dispersion of their thoughts?" 83

The View from Above
No one has better expressed our longing for a view from above and flight of
the soul than Goethe's Faust, as he went for his Easter promenade with
Wagner and glimpsed the evening sunset: 1
0 why does no wing lift me from the ground
To strive after the sun for ever?
In an endless evening dusk, I'd see
The silent earth beneath my feet.
Each hill would be ablaze, each vale bestilled,
And silver brooks would flow in golden streams ...
Before me day, behind the night
Heaven above and underneath the waves:
A lovely dream, until it disappears! ...
Alas! To the Spirit's wings
No mortal wing can join so easily.
And yet, when high above us, lost in vast blue spaces
The skylark sings her warbling tune,
It is inborn in every man,
That his mind surges onwards and upwards.
To the casual reader, this text seems to be nothing more than a dream about
flying: the banal desire, innate in every human being, to be able to fly. A mere
topos, in other words, as historians are often only too quick to categorize it.
In fact, however, the theme of the flight of the soul plays a role of
extraordinary importance in Goethe, as we can already glimpse from the
following lines of his letter to Schiller of May 1 2, 1798: "Your letter found
me ... in the Iliad, to which I always return with delight. It is always as if
one were in a balloon, far above everything earthly; as if one were t ruly in
that intermediate :1.one where t he gmls 11111&1 hither 1111d t hither. "' In filct, num
The Vie11J from Above 239
had succeeded in freeing himself from the weight of the earth only a few years
previously. The Montgolfier brothers had carried out their first flight on
November 21, 1 783. Goethe had been deeply impressed by this event, and in
an entirely unexpected way, this experience helped him to understand
Homeric poetry.
Besides the events they narrate, the Homeric epics show us the whole world
from the point of view of the gods, who look down upon mankind's battles
and passions from the heights of the heavens or the mountaintops, without,
however, being able to resist the temptation of intervening from time to time
on behalf of one or the other contending parties. For example, in the fifth
book of the Iliad, we speed through the space between heaven and earth
together with the steeds of Hera:
The horses winged their way unreluctant
through the space between the earth and the starry heaven.
As far as into the hazing distance a man can see with
his eyes, who sits in his eyrie gazing on the wine-blue water,
as far as this is the stride of the gods' proud neighing horses.3
At the beginning of book 13, we adopt the point of view of Zeus, and observe
along with him the lands of the Thracians, the Mysians, and other such
peoples, while elsewhere, sitting with Poseidon high on the loftiest peak of
the green-wooded island of Samothrace, we gaze at the battle and the clamor
of arms before the walls of Troy.
For Goethe, the reason Homeric poetry can raise us above all earthly things,
and allow us to observe them from the point of view of the gods, is because
it represents the paradigm of true poetry. As Goethe puts it in Poetry and
Truth:
True poetry can be recognized by the fact that, like a secular Gospel,
through the inner cheerfulness and outward pleasure it procures us, it
can free us from the mundane burdens which weigh upon us. Like a
hot-air balloon, it lifts us up into higher regions, along with the ballast
that clings to us, and lets us see, from a bird's-eye view, the mad
labyrinths of the world spread out before us. 4
In the last sentence, Goethe has in mind not only the view from above of the
Homeric gods, but also the wings which Daedalus fashioned, in order to free
himself from the Labyrinth in which Minos had imprisoned him. We shall
later see in more detail why it is that, in Goethe's view, poetry has such an
astonishing power.
The int imntcly connected themes of the bird's-eye view and flight of the
soul hll\'l' n Ionic, complex history. Before we go on to examine the moral and
240 Themes
existential meaning attributed to them, first by ancient philosophy, and then
by Goethe, it may be useful to attempt to classify the various forms in which
they appear. Since our discussion will be concerned only with philosophical
and literary texts, we can leave aside the question of the real or ostensible
Shamanic origin of these themes. s
First of all, we should emphasize that ancient philosophy and literature do
not seem to have linked the theme of the flight of the soul with the ability to
fly; that is, with the mere sensory experience of flight. Rather, it went hand
in hand with a specific conception of the power of thought and the divine
nature of the soul, which is able to raise itself above the categories of space
and time. We cannot consider this power as a natural capacity of the human
soul qua inhabitant of the terrestrial regions, nor it is a supernatural
phenomenon. With regard to the first point, it is only natural that thought or
the thinking soul can transport itself rapidly, even instantaneously, to
wherever the object of thought happens to be. Already in the seventh book of
the Odyssey,6 the swiftness of ships is compared with that of wings and of
thought, while Xenophon, in his MemfJrabilia, remarks that the thought of the
soul, just like the divine thought, can instantarieously transport itself to Egypt
or to Sicily.7 This idea was frequently taken up by Philo of Alexandria, who
used it to illustrate the themes of the immortality of the soul, the greatness
of man, and his likeness to God."
According to another conception, however, the flight of the soul did not
consist in the mere experience of thinking, which is in a sense a banal,
everyday phenomenon. Rather, it was something that could only be experienced
under extraordinary circumstances: in particular, it came about as a
consequence of the separation of the soul from the body.
Here we recognize the doctrine of Plato: according to the myth of the
Phaedrus,9 the soul is provided with wings by nature. Prior to its incarnation
in a terrestrial body, the soul is thus able to rise up to the outermost limits
of the heavens, and follow the procession of the winged chariots of the gods.
If, however, the soul proves itself to be too weak for celestial existence, it loses
its wings and falls into a body. The soul can only win back its wings when it
separates itself from the body; in other words, after death. When Cicero in
the Tuscula11 Disputations,111 or Seneca in his Consolation to Marcia,1 1 speak of
the soul's post-mortem existence, they describe how souls discover the secrets
of nature and look down on the earth from above. Plato, however, would
above all have underlined the fact that, during its celestial journeys, the soul
can contemplate the supracelestial world of eternal forms, as it did in its
previous life, before its fall into the corporeal world.
Shortly before death, the soul already begins to feel the effects of its
imminent separation from the body; hence it is able to journey into the
beyond. In the tenth book of the Rep11Mit', Plato tells 1 he !ltory of Er t he
Pnmphylian, who w1111 leli for dead on tht• h111tlclidd, 11nd whu11t• 1111ul w11s
The View from Above 241
temporarily separated from his body. When Proclus discusses this passage in
his Commentary on Plato s Republic, 12 he reports a number of similar stories,
about Aristeas of Proconnesus, Hermodorus of Clazomenae, and Epimenides
of Crete. Democritus also seems to have made a collection of such stories, 13 and
Clearchus of Soloi, a pupil of Aristotle, told the tale of the psychic flight of a
certain Oeonymus of Athens, whose soul had risen high up above the earth,
and from there had had glimpses of completely unknown regions of the earth. 14
Plutarch, in his essay On the Delays of Divine Vengeance, recounts the
experiences of a certain Thespesius of Soloi, who had also been left for dead:
He saw nothing like what he had seen before: the stars were enormously
large, and immeasurably far from one another, and they shone forth
with a light of great force and marvelous colours, so that the soul, gently
and lightly transported by this light like a ship on a calm sea, could
quickly move to wherever it wished. 15
In the view of the ancients, even the most insignificant dream was a separation
of soul from body, in the course of which the soul could rise up to celestial
heights. We need only think of the example of Cicero's Dream of Scipio.16
The separation of soul from body can also occur by purely spiritual means.
This spiritual "death to the body" was carried out by means of philosophy,
for according to Plato, philosophy is nothing but training for death:
Shall we not say that purification occurs ... when man separates the
soul as much as possible from the body, and accustoms it to gather itself
together from every part of the body and concentrate itself until it is
completely independent, and to have its dwelling, so far as it can, both
now and in the future, alone and by itself, freed from the shackles of
the body?17
We shall have occasion later on to return to the precise meaning of this
philosophical exercise. For the moment, suffice it to say that when Plato
wants to describe the philosophical life, he does so by means of the image of
the soul's gathering itself together, and its subsequent flight into the infinity
of the heavens. This flight allows the soul to look down from above at human
affairs, in the truest sense of the phrase.
As for the philosopher himself, Plato describes him as follows in the
Theaetetlls:
In fact, it is only his body that lives and has its residence in the state;
his soul, however, holds all this to be puny and meaningless, and
con1 cmp1 uously wanders all over the place, "under the earth," as Pindar
N11y11, 11ml mt•u11urinic whatever is on its surface, and "above the heavens,"
242 Themes
observing the stars, and in general thoroughly investigating the nature
of everything that is, but without lowering itself to the level of any of
the objects in its vicinity .1a
In the Republic, Plato expresses the view that greatness of soul consists in
precisely such an attitude: "For smallness is particularly contrary to the soul
which always strives after the complete and perfect, both divine and
human." 19 Such a soul, capable of observing the totality of space and time,
has no fear even of death.
Here it might not be inappropriate to try to formulate more precisely two
concepts with which we have been dealing: on the one hand, the concept of
philosophy as a means of achieving spiritual death, and, on the other, the idea
of philosophy as the ascent of the soul into the celestial heights. Plato
developed these ideas and concepts in a specifically Platonic direction, but in
and of themselves they arc not specifically Platonic. Rather, they are to be
found in all the ancient philosophical schools, be they Epicurean, Stoic, or
Cynic.
In other words, in all schools - with the exception of Skepticism -
philosophy was held to be an exercise consisting in learning to regard both
society and the individuals who comprise it from the point of view of
universality. This was accomplished partly with the help of a philosophical
theory of nature, but above all through moral and existential exercises. The
goal of such exercises was to help people free themselves from the desires and
passions which troubled and harassed them. These needs and desires, it was
thought, were imposed on the individual by social conventions and the needs
of the body. The goal of philosophy was to eliminate them, so that the
individual might come to see things as nature herself sees them, and
consequently desire nothing other than that which is natural. If we leave aside
for the moment terminological and conceptual differences, we can say that,
within each school, philosophy signified the attempt to raise up mankind from
individuality and particularity to universality and objectivity. For example,
philosophical death for the Platonists consisted in getting rid of one's
passions, in order to attain to the autonomy of thought. For the Stoics,
philosophical death consisted in putting oneself in accord with universal
reason, the all-embracing Logos, both interior and exterior.
Thus, in each philosophical school we encounter one and the same
conception of philosophy. Similarly, in each philosophical school we find the
same conception of the the cosmic flight and the view from above as the
philosophical way par excellence of looking at things. In particular, Platonists,
Stoics, and Epicureans all discovered, in addition to their theoretical physics,
a practical physics, which was conceived of as an exercise in which the
imagination speeds through the infinite v11stnesscs of the univc1·sc. EN11ecinlly
for t.hc Plntonists nnd t he StoicN, t he icrntl of t hi11 liwd 11hysic11 of the uni verNc
The View from Above 243
was to attain to greatness of soul, and in all schools its function was to teach
people to despise human affairs and to achieve inner peace.
The exercise of practical physics is already hinted at in Plato's Timaeus,20
where the soul is urged to bring its inner movements into accord with the
movements and harmony of the all. Again, we find the same theme in the area
of meteorologia: that is, speech which - according to the Hippocratic method,
as Plato says in the Phaedrus21 - places the soul and human affairs within the
perspective of the all. Such a method, Plato adds, leads to nobility of thought.
Epicurean physics also opens up a wide field for mental flight, in the
infinity of space and the infinite number of worlds. Thus Lucretius: "Since
space stretches far beyond the boundaries of our world, into the infinite, our
mind seeks to sound out what lies within this infinity, in which the mind can
plunge its gaze at will, and to which the mind's thoughts can soar in free
flight." 22 Elsewhere, Lucretius says that Epicurus has "boldly broken down
the tightly shut gates of nature," and "Advanced far beyond the the flaming
walls of our world." 23 In mind and thought, claims Lucretius, Epicurus has
sped through the whole of infinity, thence to return victoriously and teach us
what can and cannot come into being. 24
This spiritual conquest of space kindled the enthusiasm of the eighteenth
century, which dreamed of producing a new Lucretius. Andre Chenier25
sought to give new life to this ideal in his unfinished poem "Hermes":
Equipped with the wings of Buff on
And lit by the torch of Newton, my flight
Often soars, with Lucretius, beyond the azure girdle
That stretches around the globe.
I sec Being, Life, and their unknown Source;
And all the worlds tumbling through the Ether.
I follow the comet with its fiery tail
And the stars, with their weight, form and distance;
I voyage with them in their immense orbits ...
Before my avid gaze, the diverse Elements unfold,
With their Strife and their Love, the Causes and the Infinite.26
To return to Epicurean cosmic flights: the Epicurean sage's gaze upon
infinity probably corresponds to that of the Epicurean gods. Unconcerned by
mundane affairs in their bright, eternal tranquillity, they spend their time
contemplating the infinity of space, time, and the multiple worlds.
We encounter this same tranquillity in the Stoic tradition, especially in the
text from Philo of Alexandria cited more fully below, which describes
philosophers in the following terms:
As their gonl is a life of peace and serenity, they contemplate nature and
eve1·y 1 hin� found within her: they attentively explore the earth, the sea,
244 Themes
the air, the sky, and every nature found therein. In thought, they
accompany the moon, the sun, and the rotations of the other stars,
whether fixed or wandering. Their bodies remain on earth, but they give
wings to their souls, so that, rising into the ether, they may observe the
powers which dwell there, as is fitting for those who have truly become
citizens of the world. 27
For Marcus Aurelius, only the "physical" viewpoint on things is capable of
giving us greatness of soul; thus we have often found him practicing those
spiritual exercises which have to do with the "physical" viewpoint on things.
As he says in book 9 of the Meditations: "You have the power to strip off
many superfluous things that are obstacles to you , and that depend entirely
upon your value-judgments; you will open up for yourself a vast space by
embracing the whole universe in your thoughts, by considering unending
eternity." 28 In book 7, he admonishes himself as follows:
Watch and see the courses of the stars as if you were running alongside
them, and continually dwell in your mind upon the changes of the
elements into one another; for these imaginations wash away the foulness
of life on the earth. When you are reasoning about mankind, look upon
earthly things below as if from some vantage point above them.29
We shall return later to the final phrase. Elsewhere, Marcus describes the way
in which the soul plunges itself into the totality of space and the infinity of
time: "it traverses the whole Universe and the surrounding void, and surveys
its shape, reaches out into the boundless extent of time, embracing and
pondering the periodic rebirth of the all." 30 The goal of physics as a spiritual
exercise was to relocate human existence within the infinity of time and space,
and the perspective of the great laws of nature. This is what Marcus means
by the all-embracing metamorphosis he mentions,31 but he also has in mind
the correspondence of all things, and the mutual implication of each thing in
everything else.
Here, I believe, we have the reason why Goethe, in the passage quoted
above, considered true poetry as an exercise consisting in spiritually elevating
oneself high above the earth. For Goethe, poetry in the truest sense is a kind
of physics, in the sense we have defined above: it is a spiritual exercise, which
consists in looking down at things from above, from the point of view of the
nature or the all, and the great laws of nature. By "laws of nature" we are to
understand not only the all-embracing metamorphosis and unity of all things,
but also the two universal principles Goethe refers to as "polarity" and
"increase," and which he loved to observe bo1 h in nature and in individual
human life.32 We can detect the inspiration of 1 heHe idens not only in Goethe's
youthful poetic cycle "God and the Worlll, 11 h111 11hm in lhc more modcsl 1111d
The View from Above 245
unassuming poems of the older Goethe. Like the physics of antiquity, poetry
thus conceived is intended to bring about in its readers or listeners greatness
of soul and inner peace.
We now move on to another aspect of this spiritual exercise. The view
from above can also be directed pitilessly upon mankind's weaknesses and
shortcomings. All the philosophical schools dealt with this theme at length,
but, as we shall see, it was treated with particular relish by the Cynic
tradition. In Ovid's Metamorphoses, we find a Nee-Pythagorean version of the
theme: "It is a delight to travel along the starry firmament and, leaving the
earth and its dull regions behind, to ride on the clouds, to stand upon stout
Atlas' shoulders and see, far below, men wandering aimlessly, devoid of
reason, anxious and in fear of the hereafter, thus to exhort them and unroll
the book of fate!" 33 We encounter an Epicurean version of it at the beginning
of book 2 of Lucretius' On the Nawre of Things: "nothing is more delightful
than to possess well-fortified sanctuaries serene, built up by the teachings of
the wise, whence you may look down from on high upon others and behold
them all astray, wandering abroad and seeking the paths of life." 34
The theme takes on a Stoic coloration in Seneca's Natural QJlestions.35 Here
the soul of the philosopher, looking down from the heights of the heavens,
becomes aware of the puniness of the earth, and the ridiculousness of the wars
fought by human armies - which resemble swarms of ants - over minuscule
stretches of territory. In Marcus Aurelius, the theme appears in a particularly
realistic form: "look upon earthly things below as if from some place above
them - herds, armies, farms, weddings, divorces, births, deaths, the noise of
law courts, lonely places, various foreign nations, festivals, mournings, market
places: a mixture of everything and an order composed of contraries." 36
Elsewhere, Marcus enjoins us to: " 'Look from above' at the spectacle of
myriad herds, myriad rites, and manifold journeyings in storm and calm;
diversities of creatures who are being born, coming together, passing away." 37
The view from above thus leads us to consider the whole of human reality,
in all its social, geographical, and emotional aspects, as an anonymous,
swarming mass, and it teaches us to relocate human existence within the
immeasurable dimensions of the cosmos. Everything that does not depend on
us, which the Stoics called indifferent (indiflerentia) - such as health, fame,
wealth, and even death - is reduced to its true dimensions when considered
from the point of view of the nature of the all.
When the view from above takes on this specific form of observing human
beings on earth, it seems more than ever to belong to the Cynic tradition. We
find it being used with particular effectiveness by Lucian, a contemporary of
Marcus Aurelius who was strongly influenced by Cynic doctrines. In Lucian's
dialogue entitled lcaromenippus, or the Sky-man, the Cynic Menippus confides
to a friend thnt he was so disillusioned by the contradictory teachings of the
philusuplll'n• l"onct•rning tht• ultimate principles and the universe that he
246 Themes
resolved to fly up heaven to see for himself how things were.38 He fitted himself
out with a pair of wings - on the left side a vulture's wing and on the right
side that of an eagle - and soared upwards towards the moon. Once there, he
reported, "I rested myself, looking down on the earth from on high and like
Homer's Zeus, now observing the land of the horse-loving Thracians, now
the land of the Mysians, and presently, if I liked, Greece, Persia and India;
and from all this I got my fill of kaleidoscopic pleasure." 39 Once his eyes had
become accustomed to the tiny dimensions of human beings, however,
Menippus began to observe mankind. He could see "not only the nations and
cities but the people themselves as clear as could be, the traders, the soldiers,
the farmers, the litigants, the women, the animals, and, in a word, all the life
that the good green earth supports." "° Not only could Menippus see what
people were doing in the open air, but also what they were about inside their
own homes, when they thought no one was observing them. 41
After Menippus has recited a long list of the crimes and adulteries he had
seen committed inside people's homes, he sums up his overall impression:
what he saw was a cacophonous, ridiculous hodge-podge of a play. What he
found most ridiculous of all were those people who fought over the borders
of their cities and private land-holdings, since the earth itself appeared to him
so absurdly tiny and insignificant. Rich people, says Menippus, are proud of
completely unimportant things. Their domains arc no bigger than one of
Epicurus' atoms, and the sight of man's cities reminded him of an anthill,
with all its inhabitants scurrying about aimlessly.
Once he leaves the moon, Menippus travels among the stars until he arrives
at the dwelling-place of Zeus. There, he has a good laugh over the
ridiculously contradictory nature of the prayers mankind address to Zeus.
In another of Lucian's dialogues, entitled Charo11, or the lnspeclors,42
Charon, ferryman of the dead, asks for a day off, so that he can go up to the
surface of the earth and sec just what this earthly existence is which people
miss so much once they arrive in the underworld. With the help of Hermes,
he piles up several mountains on top of one another, so as to be able to
observe mankind better from on high. There follows the same kind of
description we have already seen in Marcus Aurelius and in the lcaromenippus:
Charon sees sea-travellers, trials, farmers - in a word, every kind of human
activity, but all with one thing in common: an existence full of pain. Charon
remarks: "If only humans could get it straight from the beginning: that
they're going to die; that, after a brief stay in life, they have to depart from
this life like a dream and leave everything on earth behind, then they'd live
more wisely and die with fewer regrets." But man is thoughtless; he resembles
the bubbles thrown up by a waterfall, which burst as soon as they come into
existence.
As we have said, this kind of view from above, directed tow11rd mankind'!!
earthly existence, is a typical mani fCi1t111 ion 111' Cynicism. We can Nee thi11 by
The View from Above 247
the fact that the dialogue Charon bears the Greek subtitle Episleopountes, "The
Observers," or rather "The Overseers." The Cynic philosopher saw it as his
duty to supervise the actions of his fellow men, like a kind of spy, lying in
wait for their mistakes, so as to denounce them.43 The Cynic had the task of
watching over his fellow men like their censor, surveying their behavior from
the heights of a watchtower. The words episleopos or leatasleopos - "overseer"
or "spy" - were used in antiquity as nicknames for the Cynics."" For them,
the view from above was intended to denounce the absurdity of human life.
It is no accident if, in one of Lucian's dialogues, it is precisely Charon,
ferryman of the dead, who plays the role of observing human affairs from
above; he is, after all, peculiarly well placed to observe them from the
perspective of death.
To observe human affairs from above means, at the same time, to see them
from the point of view of death. It is only this perspective which brings about
the necessary elevation and loosening of the spirit, which can provide the
distance we need in order to see things as they really are. The Cynic never
ceases denouncing mankind's delusions: forgetful of death, people passionately
attach their hearts to some object - luxury or power, for example - which,
in the course of time, they will inevitably be forced to give up. This is why
the Cynics called upon mankind to rid themselves of superfluous desires, and
to reject social conventions, and the whole of artificial civilization, as being
nothing but a source of worries, care, and suffering. The Cynics would have
us return to a simple, purely natural way of life.
To return to Lucian: we learn from his short essay How One Should Write
History that the view from above is appropriate not only to the philosopher
but also to the historian. More precisely, the historian's gaze must be the same
as the philosopher's: courageous, free of party affiliations, not bound to any
nation, but equally well disposed towards all, making no concessions either to
friendship or to hate. This attitude must be expressed in the historian's
presentation of his materials. The historian, says Lucian, must be like
Homer's Zeus: gazing now at the land of the Thracians, now at the land of
the Mysians.45
For the third time now, we encounter the Homeric topos of a god casting
his gaze down at the earth. This time, however, the Homeric source is quoted
so as to serve as a model of that impartiality which must characterize historical
reporting, thanks to the elevated viewpoint the historian has elected as his
own. This is what a modern writer might refer to as "the viewpoint of Sirius."
Thus we find Ernest Renan writing in 1 880: "Viewed from the solar system,
our revolutions have scarcely the extent of the movements of atoms.
Considered from Sirius, they are even smaller still."�6 To adopt the viewpoint
of Sirius means, here again, to undertake the spiritual exercise of letting go
and usin!( reserve, so as to achieve impartiality, objectivity, and critical
judgmcnl .
248 Themes
I have only been able to bring up here a few aspects of an extraordinarily
rich tradition. If - as I hope to do one day - one were to write the complete
history of the theme of the view from above, many other texts would have to
be taken into consideration. Here, by way of conclusion, I shall restrict myself
to citing Baudelaire's poem "Elevation," in which the great Symbolist describes
the experience of the poet. For him, the poet was a being not meant for this
world (as he put it in "The Albatross," "His huge wings prevent him from
walking"). Yet, thanks to his poetic gifts, which allow him to observe things
from above, the poet is also a being capable of seizing the hidden correspondences
in things. We thus return to the theme of Goethe's "true poetry," which
is really a kind of physics in the sense in which we have defmed this term
above: an intensive attempt to plunge into the secrets of nature.
[Elevation]
Above the ponds, above the valleys,
The mountains, woods, the clouds, and seas,
Beyond the sun, beyond the ether-,
Beyond the limits of the starry spheres,
My spirit, you move with swift agility.
Like a good swimmer at home in the sea,
You slice gay furrows through the measureless depths,
With ineffable, masculine joy.
Fly far away from these pestilent fumes,
Go cleanse yourself in the upper air.
Go drink, like a pure, celestial liquor,
The bright fire that fills transparent space.
Left behind, all cares and endless sorrow
That weigh upon our foggy life like stones!
Oh happy man, who soars on sturdy wings
To calm and luminous fields!
In the morning, his thoughts, in their freedom,
soar up to the heavens like larks.
- He sails over life, understanding with ease
The language of flowers and voiceless things. •7

The Sage and the World
1 Definition of the Problem
No one has described the relationship between the ancient sage and the world
around him better than Bernard Groethuysen:
The sage's consciousness of the world is something peculiar to
him alone. Only the sage never ceases to have the whole constantly
present to his mind. He never forgets the world, but thinks and
acts with a view to the cosmos. . . . The sage is a part of the world;
he is cosmic. He does not let himself be distracted from the world,
or detached from the cosmic totality .... The figure of the sage
forms, as it were, an indissoluble unity with man's representation of the
world. 1
This is particularly true of the Stoic sage, whose fundamental attitude
consisted in a joyful "Yes!" accorded at each instant to the movement of the
world, directed as it is by universal reason. We recall Marcus Aurelius'
well-known prayer to the universe: "All that is in tune with you, 0 universe,
is in tune with me." 2 Perhaps less well known is the aesthetic theory Marcus
developed from the same point of view:
If a person has experience and a deeper insight into the processes of
the universe, there will be hardly any phenomenon accompanying
these processes that does not appear to him, at lea'>t in some of
its aspects, as pleasant. And he will look upon the actual gaping jaws
of wild beasts with no less pleasure than upon all the imitations of
them that sculptors and painters off er us .... and there are many
such things, which do not appeal to everyone; only to

We recall, moreover, that the Stoic sage, like Seneca, was conscious of being
a part of the world, and plunged himself into the totality of the cosmos: Ioli
se inserens mundo.4
The same could be said of the Epicurean sage, even though the physics he
professed considered the world to be the result of chance, excluding all divine
intervention. Nevertheless, this conception of the world suited the Epicurean
perfectly: it brought with it pure pleasure and peace of mind, freed him from
unreasonable fear of the gods, and made him consider each instant as a kind
of unexpected miracle. As Hoffmann pointed out,5 it is precisely because the
Epicurean considered existence to be the result of pure chance that he greeted
each moment with immense gratitude, like a kind of divine miracle. The
sage's pleasure came from contemplating the world in peace and serenity; and
in this he resembled the gods, who took no part in the management of the
world, lest their eternal repose be disturbed. Describing the sage's contemplation,
analogous to that of the gods, Lucretius exclaimed:
the terrors of the mind fly away, the walls of the world part asunder, I
see things moving on through all the void . :
. At these things, as it were,
some godlike pleasure and a thrill of awe seizes on me, to think that thus
... nature is made so clear and manifest, laid bare to sight on every
side.6
This cosmic dimension is thus essential to the figure of the antique sage.
Here the reader may object: it could well be that ancient wisdom - whether
Platonic, Aristotelian, Stoic, or Epicurean - was intimately linked with a
relationship to the world; but isn't this ancient vision of the world out of date?
The quantitative universe of modern science is totally unrepresentable, and
within it the individual feels isolated and lost. Today, nature is nothing more
for us than man's "environment"; she has become a purely human problem,
a problem of industrial hygiene. The idea of universal reason no longer makes
much sense.
All this is quite true. But can the experience of modern man be reduced to
the purely technico-scientific? Does not modern man, too, have his own
experience of the world qua world? Finally, might not this experience be able
to open up for him a path toward wisdom?
2 The World of Science and the World of Everyday Perception
It would be stating the obvious to affirm that the world which we perceive in
our everyday experience is radically different from the unrepresentable world
constructed by the scientist. The world of science docs indeed, by mennK of
its multiple tcchnic11I npplicnl ions, r11d ic111ly 1 rnm1form 1mme 11s11ectK of our
The Sage and the World 253
daily life. Yet it is essential to realize that our way of perceiving the world in
everyday life is not radically affected by scientific concepti9ns. For all of us
- even for the astronomer, when he goes home at night - the sun rises and
sets, and the earth is immobile.
Following Husserl, Merleau-Ponty developed some noteworthy reflections
on this opposition between the world of science and the world of
perception:
The entire world of science is constructed on the basis of the world as
we experience it [sur le monde vecu], and if we want rigorously to think
through science itself, in order precisely to appreciate its range and its
meaning, we must first of all reawaken this experience of the world, of
which science is the secondary expression.7
For lived, existential experience, the earth is nothing other than the immobile
ground8 in relation to which I move, the fundamental referent of my
existence. It is this earth, immobile in relation to our experienced movements,
that even the astronaut uses as a reference point, including when, from the
depths of space, the earth appears to him like a little blue ball. The analyses
of Husserl and Merleau-Ponty thus let us see that the Copernican revolution,
of which so much is made in philosophy handbooks, upset only the theoretical
discourse of the learned about the world, but did not at all change the
habitual, day-to-day perception we have of the world.
We must, however, be more specific about the opposition between the
world of science and the world of everyday perception. The reason why
Husserl and Merleau-Ponty want us to return to the world of lived
perception, or rather to this perception-as-a-world, is so that we may become
awa.re of it. This awareness, in tum, will radically transform our very
perception of the world, since it will no longer be a perception of distinct
objects, but perception of the world as a world, and, especially for MerleauPonty,
perception of the uni()' of the world and of perception. In their view,
philosophy is nothing other than this process by means of which we try "to
relearn to see the world." 9
In a sense, one might say that the world of science and the world of
philosophy are both, in their own way, opposed to the world of habitual
perception. In the case of science, this opposition takes the form of the
elimination of perception. Science discloses to us a universe reduced, by both
mathematical and technological means, to its quantitative aspects. Philosophy,
for its part, deepens and transforms h:\_bitual perception, forcing us to become
aware of the very fact the we are perceiving the world, and that the world is
that which we perceive.
We fine.I n Himilar di11tinction between habitual and philosophical perception
in the wri1 inl(N of UcrgKon. He describes this difference as follows: 10
254 Themes
Life requires that we put on blinkers; we must not look to the right, to
the left, or behind, but straight ahead, in the direction in which we
are supposed to walk. In order to live, we must be selective in
our knowledge and our memories, and retain only that which may
contribute to our action upon things.
Bergson continues: "We could say the same thing about perception. As an
auxiliary of action, it isolates, out of the totality of the real, that which
interests us." Some people, however, are born detached: artists.
When they look at a thing, they see itfor itselJ, and no longer for lhem. They
no longer perceive merely for the sake of action: they perceive for the sake
of perceiving; that is, for no reason, for the pure pleasure of it ...
That which nature does once in a long while, out of distraction, for a
few privileged people; might not philosophy ... attempt the same thing,
in another sense and in another way, for everybody? Might not the role
of philosophy be to bring us to a more complete perception of reality,
by means of a kind of displacement of our attention?
The "displacement of attention" of which Bergson speaks, as in the case of
Merleau-Ponty's "phenomenological reduction," is in fact a conversion:11 a
radical rupture with regard to the state of unconsciousness in which man
normally lives. The utilitarian perception we have of the world, in everyday
life, in fact hides from us the world qua world. Aesthetic and philosophical
perceptions of the world are only possible by means of a complete transformation
of our relationship to the world: we have to perceive it for itself, and
no longer for ourselves.
3 Aesthetic Perception
Bergson and, as we shall see later, Merleau-Ponty consider the aesthetic
perception of the world as a kind of model for philosophical percep,tion. In
fact, as J. Ritter has pointed out,12 it is only with the flourishing of modem
science, from the eighteenth century on, and the transformation of the
philosopher's relationship to nature which came about as a result, that we find
an awareness of the necessity of an "aesthetic" mode of perception, in order
to allow existence - man's Dasein - to maintain the cosmic dimension essential
to human existence. As early as 1 750, Baumgarten,u in his Aeslhetica, had
opposed veritas /ogica to verilas aesthetica1•: veritas /ogica was, for example, the
knowledge of an eclipse appropriate to an astronomer, while aesthetic truth
might be, for example, a shepherd's emotional perception of the same
phenomenon, 1111 he dcKcribcs it tu his hclovcd . In hiH C:riti1111e njJ111lxemt111 of
The Sage and the World 255
1 790, Kant also opposed aesthetic perception to scientific knowledge. In order
to perceive the ocean as sublime, writes Kant, it is not necessary to associate
with it all sorts of geographical or meteorological knowledge while we look at
it. Rather: "one must come to see the ocean, all by itself - just as the poets
do, exclusively according to what it displays to the eye, when it is contemplated
either at rest, in the form of a limpid mirror of water, or when it is violently
stirred, like an abyss threatening to swallow up everything." 15 When, between
1815 and 1 830, C.G. Carus wrote his Lettres sur la peinture de paysage,16 he
characterized landscape-painting as the "art of the representation of the life
of the earth [Erdlebenbildkunst]." For Carus, it is thanks to aesthetic perception
that we may continue to live in that perceptive, lived relationship with
the earth, which constitutes an essential dimension of human existence.
Thus, a disinterested, aesthetic perception of the world can allow us to
imagine what cosmic consciousness might signify for modern man. Modern
artists, reflecting on their art, regard it as inseparable from a completely
characteristic experience of the world.
In the first place, the modern artist consciously participates in cosmic life
as he creates. "The dialogue with nature," writes Paul Klee, 17 "remains for
the artist the condition sine qua non. The artist is a man. He is himself nature,
a part of nature within the domain of nature." This dialogue with nature
presupposes an intense communication with the world, carried out not merely
through visual channels: "Today, the artist is better and more subtle than a
camera ... he is a creature upon earth and a creature within the universe; a
creature on one star among the other stars." This is why there are, according
to Klee, means other than visual for establishing the relationship between the
self and its object. There is the fact that we plunge our roots into the same
soil, and that we share a common participation in the cosmos. This means
that the artist must paint in a state in which he feels his unity with the earth
and with the universe.
For Klee, then, abstract art appears as a kind of prolongation of the work
of nature:
[The artist's] progress in the observation and vision of nature gradually
lets him accede to a philosophical vision of the universe which allows
him freely to create abstract forms ... Thus, the artist creates works of
art, or participates in the creation of works, which are an image of the
creative work of God ... Just as children imitate us while playing, so
we, in the game of art, imitate the forces which created, and continue
to create, the world ... Natura naturans is more important to the painter
than ttaturti ttaturata. 18
We rc-enl·ountcr this cosmic consciousness in Cezanne. 19 "Have you seen
thnt l(il{1mtk Tintorclto in Venice," he writes,
256 Themes
in which the earth and the sea, the terraqueous globe, are hanging
above people's heads? The horizon is moving off into the distance; the
depth, the ocean distances, and bodies are taking flight, an immense
rotundity, a mappamundi; the planet is hurled, falling and rolling in
mid-ether! ... He was prophesying for us. He already had the same
cosmic obsession which is consuming us now .... As for me, I want to
lose myself in nature, to grow again with her, like her .... In a patch
of green, my whole brain will flow along with the flowing sap of the
trees .... The immensity, the torrent of the world, in a tiny thumb's
worth of matter.
As we saw, the painter, according to Klee, feels himself to be a
"piece of nature, within the domain of nature." We find the same theme
in Roger Caillois' Generalized Aesthetics,11.l apropos of the experience of
beauty:
Natural structures constitute both the initial and the final reference
point of all imaginable beauty, although beauty is human appreciation.
Since man himself belongs to nature, the circle can easily be closed, and
the feeling man has of beauty merely reflects his condition as a living
being and integral part of the universe. It does not follow from this that
nature is the model of art, but rather that art constitutes a particular
instance of nature: that which occurs when the aesthetic act undergoes
the additional process of design and execution.
The artistic process shares with the creative process of nature the characteristic
of rendering things visible, causing them to appear. Merleau-Ponty
laid great stress on this idea:21 "Art no longer imitates visible things; it makes
things visible. 22 It is the blueprint of the genesis of things. Paintings show how
things become things and how the world becomes a world .... how mountains
become, in our view, mountains." Painting makes us feel the presence
of things: the fact that "things arc here.'' "When CCzannc strives after depth,"
continues Mcrleau-Ponty, "what he's really seeking is the combustion of
being."
The experience of modern art thus allows us to glimpse - in a way that
is, in the last analysis, philosophical - the miracle of perception itself,
which opens up the world to us. Yet we can only perceive this miracle by
reflecting on perception, and converting our attention. In this way, we can
change our relationship to the world, and when we do so, we arc astonished
by it. We break off "our familiarity with the world, and this break can teach
us nothing other than the unmotivated surging-forth of the world." 2·1 At such
moments, it is as if we were seeing the world nppcnr before our eyes for the
first t ime.
The Sage and the World 257
4 Spectator Novus
There is nothing new in what we have said so far. Our reason for recalling it
was in order to define the area of our experience in which there might be
possible a relationship to the world bearing some resemblance to that which
existed between the ancient sage and the cosmos: the world, that is, of
perception. We are now in a position to show that, since ancient times, there
have existed exercises by means of which philosophers have tried to transform
their perception of the world, in a way analogous to Merleau-Ponty's
phenomenological reduction, or to the conversion of attention spoken of by
Bergson. Obviously, the philosophical discourses by which Bergson, MerleauPonty,
and the philosophers of antiquity express or justify the procedure
which leads to the transformation of perception are very different from one
another, just as the discussions of Klee or CCzanne about painting are not to
be confused with the phenomenology of Merleau-Ponty. Be that as it may,
Mcrleau-Ponty was deeply conscious of the sense in which, above and beyond
differences of discourse, the experiences of Klee or CCzanne coincided with
his own. One could say the same about the similar experience which can be
glimpsed behind certain quite striking texts from antiquity.
For example, let us consider this passage from one of Seneca's Leuers lo
Luci/ius: "As for me, I usually spend a great deal of time in the contemplation
of wisdom. I look at it with the same stupefaction with which, on other
occasions, I look at the world; this world that I quite often feel as though I
were seeing for the first time [ 1amquam spectatt1r novus ]. " 24 If Seneca speaks
of stupefaction, it is because he sometimes finds that he discovers the world
all of a sudden, "as though [he] were seeing it for the first time." At such
moments, he becomes conscious of the transformation taking place in his
perception of the world. Normally, he had not been in the habit of seeing the
world, and consequently was not astonished by it. Now, all of a sudden, he
is stupefied, because he sees the world with new eyes.
The Epicurean Lucretius was familiar with the same experience as the Stoic
Seneca. In book 2 of his On the Ntiture of Things,- he announces that he is
going to proclaim a new teaching: "A truth wondrously new is struggling to
fall upon your ears, and a new face of things to reveal itself." Indeed, it is not
surprising if this new teaching strikes the imagination: Lucretius is about to
assert the existence of infinite space, and, within this infinite space, of a
plurality of worlds. In order to prepare his reader for this novelty, Lucretius
introduces some considerations about mankind's psychological reactions to
novelties. On the one hand, he says, we find that which is new difficult to
believe; whatever disturbs our mental habits seems to us a priori false and
inadmissible. Once we have admitted it, however, the same force of habit
which mudt• 1 hc novelty surprising and paradoxical subsequently makes it
258 Themes
seem banal, and our admiration gradually diminishes. Lucretius then describes
how the world would look to us if we saw it for the first time:
First of all, the bright, clear colour of the sky, and all it holds within
it, the stars that wander here and there, and the moon and the
radiance of the sun with its brilliant light; all these, if now they had been
seen for the first time by mortals, if, unexpectedly, they were in a
moment placed before their eyes, what story could be told more
marvelous than these things, or what that the nations would less dare to
believe beforehand? Nothing, I believe; so worthy of wonder would this
sight have been. Yet think how no one now, wearied with satiety of
seeing, deigns to gaze up at the shining quarters of the sky!25
These texts are extremely important for our purpose. They show that,
already in antiquity, people were not conscious of living in the world. They
had no time to look at the world, and philosophers strongly sensed the
paradox and scandal of the human condition: man lives in the world without
perceiving the world. Bergson correctly grasped the reason for this situation,
when he distinguished between habitual, utilitarian perception, necessary for
life, and the detached, disinterested perception of the artist or philosopher.
What separates us from the world is thus not the irrepresentable character of
the scientific universe - the world we live in is, after all, that of lived
perception - and neither is it contemporary doubts about the rational
character of the world: Lucretius had already denied this rationality. People
in antiquity were unfamiliar with modern science, and did not live in an
industrial, technological society; yet the ancients didn't look at the world any
more than we usually do. Such is the human condition. In order to live,
mankind must "humanize" the world; in other words transform it, by action
as well as by his perception, into an ensemble of "things" useful for life.
Thus, we fabricate the objects of our worry, quarrels, social rituals, and
conventional values. That is what our world is like; we no longer see the world
qua world. In the words of Rilke, we no longer see "the Open"; we see only
the "future." Ideally, we would
see everything
and ourselves in everything
healed and whole
forever.26
The obstacle to perceiving the world is not to be found in modernity, but
within man himself. We must separate ourselves from the world qua world in
order to live our daily life, but we muHI 11cpnrate ourscl ve11 from the
"everyday" world in order tu 1·edi11covcr 1 hc wcll'ld llllll world.
The Sage and the World 259
S The Instant
There is a well-known text, in which we can see both the echo of ancient
traditions and the anticipation of certain modern attitudes: Rousseau's
Reveries du promeneur solitaire.21 What is remarkable in this passage is that we
cannot help but recognize the intimate connection which exists, for Rousseau,
between cosmic ecstasy and the transformation of his inner attitude with
regard to time. On the one hand, "every individual object escapes him; he
sees and feels nothing which is not in the whole." 28 Yet, at the same time,
"Time no longer means anything [to him] ... the present lasts forever,
without letting its duration be sensed, and without any trace of succession.
There is no sensation - either of privation or of enjoyment, pleasure or pain,
desire or fear - other than the one single sensation of our existence." 29 Here
Rousseau analyzes, in a most remarkable way, the elements which constitute
and make possible a disinterested perception of the world. What is required
is concentration on the present moment, a concentration in which the spirit
is, in a sense, without past nor present, as it experiences the simple "sensation
of existence." Such concentration is not, however, a mere turning in
upon oneself. On the contrary: the sensation of existence is, inseparably,
the sensation of being in the whole and the sensation of the existence of the
whole.
In Rousseau, all this is a passive, almost mystical state. For the
ancients, however, it is quite apparent that the transformation of one's view
of the world was intimately linked to exercises which involved concentrating
one's mind on the present instant.30 In Stoicism as well as in
Epicureanism, such exercises consisted in "separating oneself from the
future and past," in order to "delimit the present instant." 31 Such a technique
gives the mind, freed from the burden and prejudices of the past, as
well as from worry about the future, tha t inner detachment, freedom, and
peace which are indispensable prerequisites for perceiving the world qua
world. We have here, moreover, a kind of reciprocal causality: the mind
acquires peace and serenity by becoming aware of its relationship with the
world, to the extent that it re-places our existence within the cosmic
perspective.
This concentration on the present moment lets us discover the infinite
value and unheard-of miracle of our presence in the world. Concentration
on the present instant implies the suspension of our projects for the
future. In other words, it implies that we must think of the present
moment as the last moment, and that we live each day and each hour as if
it were our last. For the Epicureans, th is exercise reveals the incredible
stroke of luck thnnks to which each moment we live in the world is made
po1111ihlc.
260 Themes
Believe that every day that dawns will be the final one for you. If you
do, you will receive each unexpected hour with gratitude.32
Receive each moment of accumulating time as though it came about by
an incredible stroke of luck. 33
Let the soul find its joy in the present, and learn to hate worries about
the future. 34
Albeit for different reasons, the Stoics also shared this attitude of
wonder at what appears and occurs in the present instant. For them, each
instant and each present moment imply the entire universe, and the whole
history of the world. Just as each instant presupposes the immensity of
time, so does our body presuppose the whole universe. It is within ourselves
that we can experience the coming-into-being of reality and the presence of
being. By becoming conscious of one single instant of our lives, one single
beat of our hearts, we can feel ourselves linked to the entire immensity of the
cosmos, and to the wondrous fact of the world's existence. The whole
universe is present in each part of reality. For the Stoics, this experience of
the instant corresponds to their theory of the mutual interpenetration of the
parts of the universe. Such an experience, however, is not necessarily linked
to any theory. For example, we find it expressed in the following verses by
Blake:
To see a World in a Grain of Sand
And a Heaven in a Wild Flower,
Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand
And Eternity in an hour.35
To sec the world for the last time is the same thing as to see it for the first
time, tamqutim spectator 11ovus. 36 This impression can be caused by the thought
of death, which reveals to us the miraculous character of our relationship to
the world: always in peril, always unforeseeable. Alternatively, it can be
caused by the feeling of novelty brought about by concentrating one's
attention on one instant, one moment of the world: the world then seems to
come into being and be born before our eyes. We then perceive the world as
a "nature" in the etymological sense of the world: physis, that movement of
growth and birth by which things manifest thcmselves.37 We experience
ourselves as a moment or instant of this movement; this immense event which
reaches beyond us, is always already there before us, and is always beyond us.
We are born along with 38 the world. The feeling of existence of which
Rousseau spoke is precisely this feeling of identity between univl�rsul bcinic
and our own ex istence.
The Sage and the World
6 The Sage and the World
261
Seneca was equally stupefied by the spectacle of the world (which he
contemplated tamquam spectator novus), and by the spectacle of wisdom. By
"wisdom,'' he meant the figure of the sage, as he saw it personified in the
personality of the philosopher Sextus.
This is a very instructive parallel. There is in fact a strict analogy between
the movement by which we accede to the vision of the world, and that by
which we postulate the figure of the sage. In the first place, ever since Plato's
Symposium, ancient philosophers considered the figure of the sage as an
inaccessible role model, whom the philo-sopher (he who loves wisdom) strives
to imitate, by means of an ever-renewed effort, practiced at each instant. 39 To
contemplate wisdom as personified within a specific personality was thus to
carry out a movement of the spirit in which, via the life of this personality,
one was led toward the representation of absolute perfection, above and
beyond all of its possible realizations. Similarly, in considering a partial aspect
of the world, contemplation discovers the totality of the world, going beyond
the landscape�0 glimpsed at a given moment, and transcending it on the way
to a representation of totality which surpasses every visible object.
The contemplation mentioned by Seneca is, moreover, a kind of unitive
contemplation. In order to perceive the world, we must, as it were, perceive our
uni()! with the world, by means of an exercise of concentration on the present
moment. Similarly, in order to recognize wisdom, we must, so to speak, go
into training for wisdom. We can know a thing only by becoming similar to
our object. Thus, by a total con version, we can render ourselves open to the
world and to wisdom. This is why Seneca was just as stupefied and filled with
ecstasy by the spectacle of wisdom as he was by the spectacle of the world. For
him, in both instances, it was a case of a discovery obtained by dint of an
interior transformation and complete change in his way of seeing and living.
In the final analysis, both the world as perceived in the conseiousness of the
sage, and the sage's consciousness itself, plunged in the totality of the world,
are revealed to the lover of wisdom in one single, unique movement.

Philosophy as a Way of Life
Every person - whether Greek or Barbarian - who is in training for
wisdom, leading a blameless, irreproachable life, chooses neither to
commit injustice nor return it unto others, but to avoid the company of
busybodies, and hold in contempt the places where they spend their
time - courts, councils, marketplaces, assemblies - in short, every kind
of meeting or reunion of thoughtless people. As their goal is a life of
peace and serenity, they contemplate nature and everything found
within her: they attentively explore the earth, the sea, the air, the sky,
and every nature found therein. In thought, they accompany the moon,
the sun, and the rotations of the other stars, whether fixed or wandering.
Their bodies remain on earth, but they give wings to their souls, so that,
rising into the ether, they may observe the powers which dwell there, as
is fitting for those who have truly become citizens of the world. Such
people consider the whole world as their city, and its citizens are the
companions of wisdom; they have received their civic rights from virtue,
which has been entrusted with presiding over the universal commonwealth.
Thus, filled with every excellence, they are accustomed no
longer to take account of physical discomforts or exterior evils, and they
train themselves to be indifferent to indifferent things; they are armed
against both pleasures and desires, and, in short, they always strive to
keep themselves above passions ... they do not give in under the blows
of fate, because they have calculated its attacks in advance (for foresight
makes easier to bear even the most difficult of the things that happen
against our will; since then the mind no longer supposes what happens
to be strange and novel, but its perception of them is dulled, as if it had
to do with old and worn-out things). It is obvious that people such as
these, who find their joy in virtue, celebrate a festival their whole life
long. To be sure, there is only a small number of such people; they arc
like embers of wisdom kept smouldering in our cities, so that virtue may
not be altogether sn uffed out 111ul d i!111ppe11r from our ritl'C. But if only
Philosophy as a Way of Life 265
people everywhere felt the same way as this small number, and became
as nature meant for them to be: blameless, irreproachable, and lovers of
wisdom, rejoicing in the beautiful just because it is beautiful, and
considering that there is no other good besides it . . . then our cities
would be brimful of happiness. They would know nothing of the things
that cause grief and fear, but would be so filled with the causes of joy
and well-being that there would be no single moment in which they
would not lead a life full of joyful laughter; indeed, the whole cycle of
the year would be a festival for them.1
In this passage from Philo of Alexandria, inspired by Stoicism, one of the
fundamental aspects of philosophy in the Hellenistic and Roman eras comes
clearly to the forefront. During this period, philosophy was a way of life. This
is not only to say that it was a specific type of moral conduct; we can easily
see the role played in the passage from Philo by the contemplation of nature.
Rather, it means that philosophy was a mode of existing-in-the-world, which
had to be practiced at each instant, and the goal of which was to transform
the whole of the individual's life.
For the ancients, the mere word philo-sophia - the love of wisdom - was
enough to express this conception of philosophy. In the Symposium, Plato had
shown that Socrates, symbol of the philosopher, could be identified with Eros,
the son of Poros (expedient) and of Penia (poverty). Eros lacked wisdom, but
he did know how to acquire it. 2 Philosophy thus took on the form of an
exercise of the thought, will, and the totality of one's being, the goal of which
was to achieve a state practically inaccessible to mankind: wisdom. Philosophy
was a method of spiritual progress which demanded a radical conversion and
transformation of the individual's way of being.
Thus, philosophy was a way of life, both in its exercise and effort to
achieve wisdom, and in its goal, wisdom itself. For real wisdom docs not
merely cause us to know: it makes us "be" in a different way. Both the
grandeur and the paradox of ancient philosophy are that it was, at one and
the same time, conscious of the fact that wisdom is inaccessible, and
convinced of the necessity of pursuing spiritual progress. In the words of
Qµintillian: "We must ... strive after that which is highest, as many of the
ancient<> did. Even though they believed that no sage had ever yet been found,
they nevertheless continued to teach the precepts of wisdom." ·1 The ancients
knew that they would never be able to realize wisdom within themselves as a
stable, definitive state, but they at least hoped to accede to it in certain
privileged moments, and wisdom was the transcendent norm which guided
their action.
Wisdom, then, was a way of life which brought peace of mind (alaraxia),
inner freedom (11u1arkeia), and a cosmic consciousness. First and foremost,
philrnmphy Jll'l'Mcrllcd itself as n therapeutic, intended to cure mankind's
266 Themes
anguish. This concept is stated explicitly in Xenocrates; and in Epicurus:5
"We must not suppose that any other object is to be gained from the
knowledge of the phenomena of the sky ... than peace of mind and a sure
confidence." This was also a prominent idea for the Stoics6 and for the
Skeptics, apropos of whom Sextus Empiricus7 utilizes the following splendid
image:
Apelles, the famous painter, wished to reproduce the foam from a
horse's mouth in a painting. He was not able to get it right, and decided
to give up. So, he threw the sponge he used to wipe his brushes against
the painting. When the sponge hit the painting, it produced nothing
other than an imitation of a horse's foam. In the same way, the Skeptics
start off like the other philosophers, seeking peace of mind in firmness
and confidence in their judgments. When they do not achieve it, they
suspend their judgment. No sooner do they they do this than, by pure
chance, peace of mind accompanies the suspension of judgment, like a
shadow follows a body.
Philosophy presented itself as a method for achieving independence and
inner freedom (autarkeia), that state in which the ego depends only upon
itself. We encounter this theme in Socrates,8 among the Cynics, in Aristotle
- for whom only the contemplative life is independent9 - in Epicurus,10 and
among the Stoics. 11 Although their methodologies differ, we find in all
philosophical schools the same awareness of the power of the human self to
free itself from everything which is alien to it, even if, as in the case of the
Skeptics, it does so via the mere refusal to make any decision.
In Epicureanism and in Stoicism, cosmic consciousness was added to these
fundamental dispositions. By "cosmic consciousness," we mean the consciousness
that we are a part of the cosmos, and the consequent dilation of
our self throughout the infinity of universal nature. In the words of Epicurus'
disciple Metrodorus: "Remember that, although you are mortal and have only
a limited life-span, yet you have risen, through the contemplation of nature,
to the infinity of space and time, and you have seen all the past and all the
future." 12 According to Marcus Aurelius: "The rational soul ... travels
through the whole universe and the void that surrounds it ... it reaches out
into the boundless extent of infinity, and it examines and contemplates the
periodic rebirth of all things. " 13 At each instant, the ancient sage was
conscious of living in the cosmos, and he placed himself in harmony with the
cosmos.
In order better to understand in what way ancient philosophy could be a
way of life, it is perhaps necessary to have recourse to the dist inct ion proposed
by the Stoics, 1� between discourse a/10111 phi losophy and pllilosopliy its1.•(/: For
the Stoics, the parts of philosophy physici;, cthicH, nnd logic W(�rc nor, in
Philosophy as a Way of Life 267
fact, parts of philosophy itself, but rather parts of philosophical discourse. By
this they meant that when it comes to teaching philosophy, it is necessary to
set forth a theory of logic, a theory of physics, and a theory of ethics. The
exigencies of discourse, both logical and pedagogical, require that these
distinctions be made. But philosophy itself - that is, the philosophical way of
life - is no longer a theory divided into parts, but a unitary act, which consists
in living logic, physics, and ethics. In this case, we no longer study logical
theory - that is, the theory of speaking and thinking well - we simply think
and speak well. We no longer engage in theory about the physical world, but
we contemplate the cosmos. We no longer theorize about moral action, but
we act in a correct and just way.
Discourse aboul philosophy is not the same thing as philosophy. Polemon, one
of the heads of the Old Academy, used to say:
we should exercise ourselves with realities, not with dialectical speculations,
like a man who has devoured some textbook on harmonics, but
has never put his knowledge into practice. Likewise, we must not be like
those who can astonish their onlookers by their skill in syllogistic
argumentation, but who, when it comes to their own lives, contradict
their own teachings. 15
Five centuries later, Epictetus echoed this view:
A carpenter does not come up to you and say, "Listen to me discourse
about the art of carpentry,'' but he makes a contract for a house and
builds it .... Do the same thing yourself. Eat like a man, drink like a
man ... get married, have children, take part in civic life, learn how to
put up with insults, and tolerate other people. 16
We can immediately foresee the consequences of this distinction, formulated
by the Stoics but admitted by the majority of philosophers, concerning
the relationship between theory and practice. An Epicurean saying puts it
clearly: "Vain is the word of that philosopher which does not heal any
suffering of man." 11 Philosophical theories are in the service of the philosophical
life. That is why, in the Hellenistic and Roman periods, they were
reduced to a theoretical, systematic, highly concentrated nucleus, capable of
exercising a strong psychological effect, and easy enough to handle so that it
might always be kept close at hand (procheiro11).18 Philosophical discourse was
not systematic because it wanted to provide a total, systematic explanation of
the whole of reality. Rather, it was systematic in order that it might provide
the mind with a small number of principles, tightly linked together, which
derived greater persuasive force and mnemonic effectiveness precisely from
suc:h systcm111 ii111ion. Short sayings summed up, sometimes in striking form,
268 Themes
the essential dogmas, so that the student might easily relocate himself within
the fundamental disposition in which he was to live.
Does the philosophical life, then, consist only in the application, at every
moment, of well-studied theorems, in order to resolve life's problems? As a
matter of fact, when we reflect on what the philosophical life implies, we
realize that there is an abyss between philosophical theory and philosophizing
as living action. To take a similar case: it may seem as though artists, in their
creative activity, do nothing but apply rules, yet there is an immeasurable
distance between artistic creation and the abstract theory of art. In philosophy,
however, we are not dealing with the mere creation of a work of art:
the goal is rather to transform ourselves. The act of living in a genuinely
philosophical way thus corresponds to an order of reality totally different
from that of philosophical discourse.
In Stoicism, as in Epicureanism, philosophizing was a continuous act,
permanent and identical with life itself, which had to be renewed at each
instant. For both schools, this act could be defined as an orientation of the
attention.
In Stoicism, attention was oriented toward the purity of one's intentions.
In other words, its objective was the conformity of our individual will with
reason, or the will of universal nature. In Epicureanism, by contrast, attention
was oriented toward pleasure, which is, in the last analysis, the pleasure of
existing. In order to realize this state of attention, however, a number of
exercises were necessary: intense meditation on fundamental dogmas, the
ever-renewed awareness of the finitude of life, examination of one's conscience,
and, above all, a specific attitude toward time.
Both the Stoics and the Epicureans advised us to live in the present,
letting ourselves be neither troubled by the past, nor worried by the
uncertainty of the future. For both these schools of thought, the present
sufficed for happiness, because it was the only reality which belongs to us and
depends on us. Stoics and Epicureans agreed in recognizing the infinite value
of each instant: for them, wisdom is just as perfect and complete in one
instant as it is throughout an eternity. In particular, for the Stoic sage, the
totality of the cosmos is contained and implied in each instant. Moreover, we
not only can but we must be happy right 11ow. The matter is urgent, for the
future is uncertain and death is a constant threat: "While we're waiting
to live, life passes us by." 1'1 Such an attitude can only be understood if we
assume that there was, in ancient philosophy, a sharp awareness of
the infinite, incommensurable value of existence. Existing within the
cosmos, in the unique reality of the cosmic event, was held to be infinitely
precious.
Thus, as we have seen, philosophy in the 1-lellcnistic nnd Greek period rook
on the form of a way of life, 1m arr of living, and a wny of hcing. Thi11,
however, was not hinl( new: nncicnr llhilm;ophy hud lml t hi11 ch1l l'lll'tcr nt lc11111
Philosophy as a Way of Life 269
as far back as Socrates. There was a Socratic style of life (which the Cynics
were to imitate), and the Socratic dialogue was an exercise which brought
Socrates' interlocutor to put himself in question, to take care of himself, and
to make his soul as beautiful and wise as possible.20 Similarly, Plato defined
philosophy as a training for death, and the philosopher as the person who
does not fear death, because he contemplates the totality of time and of
being.21
It is sometimes claimed that Aristotle was a pure theoretician, but for him,
too, philosophy was incapable of being reduced to philosophical discourse, or
to a body of knowledge. Rather, philosophy for Aristotle was a quality of the
mind, the result of an inner transformation. The form of life preached by
Aristotle was the life according to the mind. 22
We must not, therefore, as is done all too often, imagine that philosophy
was completely transformed during the Hellenistic period, whether after the
Macedonian domination over the Greek cities, or during the imperial period.
On the one hand, it is not the case, as tenacious, widely-held cliches would
have us believe, that the Greek city-state died after 330 BC, and political life
along with it. Above all, the conception of philosophy as an art and form of
living is not linked to political circumstances, or to a need for escape
mechanisms and inner liberty, in order to compensate for lost political
freedom. Already for Socrates and his disciples, philosophy was a mode of
life, and a technique of inner living. Philosophy did not change its essence
throughout the entire course of its history in antiquity.
In general, historians of philosophy pay little attention to the fact that
ancient philosophy was, first and foremost, a way of life. They consider
philosophy as, above all, philosophical discourse. How can the origins of this
prejudice be explained? I believe it is linked to the evolution of philosophy
itself in the Middle Ages and in modem times.
Christianity played a considerable role in this phenomenon. From its very
beginnings - that is, from the second century AD on - Christianity had
presented itself as a philosophy: the Christian way of lifc.23 Indeed, the very
fact that Christianity was able to present itself as a philosophy confirms the
assertion that philosophy was conceived in antiquity as a way of life. If to do
philosophy was to live in conformity with the law of reason, so the argument
went, the Christian was a philosopher, since he lived in conformity with the
law of the Logos - divine reason.24 In order to present itself as a philosophy,
Christianity was obliged to integrate elements borrowed from ancient philosophy.
It had to make the Logos of the gospel according to John coincide with
Stoic cosmic reason, and subsequently also with the Aristotelian or Platonic
intellect. It also had to integrate philosophical spiritual exercises into Christian
life. The phenomenon of integration appears very clearly in Clement of
Alexnndrin, and was intensely developed in the monastic movement, where
we find l hl.' S1oico/ Plntonic exercises of attention to oneself ( prosoche),
270 Themes
meditation, examination of conscience, and the training for death. We also
re-encounter the high value accorded to peace of mind and impassibility.
The Middle Ages was to inherit the conception of monastic life as Christian
philosophy, that is, as a Christian way of life. As Dom Jean Leclerq has
written: "As much as in antiquity, philosophia in the monastic Middle Ages
designates not a theory or a way of knowing, but a lived wisdom, a way of
living according to reason." 25 At the same time, however, the medieval
universities witnessed the elimination of the confusion which had existed in
primitive Christianity between theology, founded on the rule of faith,
and traditional philosophy, founded on reason. Philosophy was now no longer
the supreme science, but the "servant of theology;" it supplied the latter
with the conceptual, logical, physical, and metaphysical materials it needed.
The Faculty of Arts became no more than a preparation for the Faculty of
Theology.
If we disregard, for the moment, the monastic usage of the word philnsophia,
we can say that philosophy in the Middle Ages had become a purely
theoretical and abstract activity. It was no longer a way of life. Ancient
spiritual exercises were no longer a part of philosophy, but found themselves
integrated into Christian spirituality. It is in this form that we encounter them
once again in the Spiritual Exercises of Saint Ignatius. 26 Neoplatonic mysticism
was prolonged into Christian mysticism, especially among such Rhineland
Dominicans as Meister Eckhardt.
Thus, the Middle Ages saw a radical change in the content of philosophy
as compared to antiquity. Moreover, from the medieval period on, theology
and philosophy were taught in those universities which had been creations of
the medieval church. Even though attempts have been made to use the word
"university" in reference to ancient educational institutions, it appears that
neither the notion nor the reality of the university ever existed during
antiquity, with the possible exception of the Orient near the end of the late
antique period.
One of the characteristics of the university is that it is made up of
professors who train professors, or professionals training professionals. Education
was thus no longer directed toward people who were to be educated
with a view to becoming fully developed human beings, but to specialists, in
order that they might learn how to train other specialists. This is the danger
of "Scholasticism," that philosophical tendency which began to be sketched
at the end of antiquity, developed in the Middle Ages, and whose presence is
still recognizable in philosophy today.
The scholastic university, dominated by theology, would continue to
function up to the end of the eighteenth century, but from the sixteenth to
the eighteenth centuries, genuinely creative philosophical activity would
develop outside the university, in the persons of Descartes, Spinoza, Mnk'­
branche, and Leibniz. Phi losophy l ltuH reconquered it11 lllllonomy vi11-1\-vis
Philosophy as a Way of Life 27 1
theology, but this movement - born as a reaction against medieval Scholasticism
- was situated on the same terrain as the latter. In opposition to one kind
of theoretical philosophical discourse, there arose yet another theoretical
discourse.
From the end of the eighteenth century onward, a new philosophy made
its appearance within the university, in the persons of Wolff, Kant, Fichte,
Schelling, and Hegel. From now on, with a few rare exceptions like
Schopenhauer or Nietzsche, philosophy would be indissolubly linked to the
university. We see this in the case of Bergson, Husserl, and Heidegger. This
fact is not without importance. Philosophy - reduced, as we have seen, to
philosophical discourse - develops from this point on in a different atmosphere
and environment from that of ancient philosophy. In modern university
philosophy, philosophy.is obviously no longer a way of life or form of life
- unless it be the form of life of a professor of philosophy. Nowadays,
philosophy's element and vital milieu is the state educational institution; this
has always been, and may still be, a danger for its independence. In the words
of Schopenhauer:
Generally speaking, university philosophy is mere fencing in front of a
mirror. In the last analysis, its goal is to give students opinions which
are to the liking of the minister who hands out the Chairs .... As a
result, this state-financed philosophy makes a joke of philosophy. And
yet, if there is one thing desirable in this world, it is to see a ray of light
fall onto the darkness of our lives, shedding some kind of light on the
mysterious enigma of our existence. 27
Be this as it may, modern philosophy is first and foremost a discourse
developed in the classroom, and then consigned to books. It is a text which
requires exegesis.
This is not to say that modern philosophy has not rediscovered, by different
paths, some of the existential aspects of ancient philosophy. Besides, it must
be added that these aspects have never completely disappeared. For example,
it was no accident that Descartes entitled one of his ·works Meditations. They
are indeed meditations - meditatio in the sense of exercise - according to the
spirit of the Christian philosophy of St Augustine, and Descartes recommends
that they be practiced over a certain period of time. Beneath its systematic,
geometrical form, Spinoza's Ethics corresponds rather well to what systematic
philosophical discourse could mean for the Stoics. One could say that
Spinoza's discourse, nourished on ancient philosophy, teaches man how to
transform, radically and concretely, his own being, and how to accede to
beatitude. The figure of the sage, moreover, appears in the final lines of the
Ethics: "the sage, in so far as he is regarded as such, is scarcely at all disturbed
in spirit, hut, hring conscious of himself, and of God, and of things, by a
272 Themes
certain eternal necessity, never ceases to be, but always possesses true
acquiescence of the spirit." 28 The philosophies of Nietzsche and of Schopenhauer
are also invitations to radically transform our way of life. Both ·
men
were, moreover, thinkers steeped in the tradition of ancient philosophy.
According to the Hegelian model, human consciousness has a purely
historical character; and the only lasting thing is the action of the spirit itself,
as it constantly engenders new forms. Under the influence of Hegel's method,
the idea arose among Marx and the young Hegelians that theory cannot be
detached from practice, and that it is man's action upon the world which gives
rise to his representations. In the twentieth century, the philosophy of
Bergson and the phenomenology of Husserl appeared less as systems than as
methods for transforming our perception of the world. Finally, the movement
of thought inaugurated by Heidegger and carried on by existentialism seeks -
in theory and in principle - to engage man's freedom. and action in the
philosophical process, although, in the last analysis, it too is primarily a
philosophical discourse.
One could say that what differentiates ancient from modern philosophy is
the fact that, in ancient philosophy, it was not only Chrysippus or Epicurus
who, just because they had developed a philosophical discourse, were
considered philosophers. Rather, every person who lived according to the
precepts of Chrysippus or Epicurus was every bit as much of a philosopher
as they. A politician like Cato of Utica was considered a philosopher and even
a sage, even though he wrote and taught nothing, because his life was
perfectly Stoic. The same was true of Roman statesmen like Rutilius Rufus
and Qµintus Mucius Scaevola Pontifex, who practiced Stoicism by showing
an exemplary disinterestedness and humanity in the administration of the
provinces entrusted to them. These men were not merely examples of
morality, but men who lived the totality of Stoicism, speaking like Stoics
(Cicero tells us explicitly29 that they refused to use a certain type of rhetoric
in the trials in which they testified), and looking at the world like Stoics; in
other words, trying to live in accord with cosmic reason. They sought to
realize the ideal of Stoic wisdom: a certain way of being human, of living
according to reason, within the cosmos and along with other human beings.
What constituted the object of their efforts was not merely ethics, but the
human being as a whole.
Ancient philosophy proposed to mankind an art of living. By contrast,
modern philosophy appears above all as the construction of a technical jargon
reserved for specialists.
Everyone is free to define philosophy as he likes, to choose whatever
philosophy he wishes, or to invent - if he can - whatever philosophy he may
think valid. Descartes and Spinoza still remained faithful to the ancient
definition: for them, philosophy wai; "the 1m1cticc of wisdom. " 111 I f, following
their cx11mplc, we believe t hat it iN eNNcntii1l fur m1111kind to try 111 11n:cdc lo
Philosophy as a Way of Life 273
the state of wisdom, we shall find in the ancient traditions of the various
philosophical schools - Socratism, Platonism, Aristotelianism, Epicureanism,
Stoicism, Cynicism, Skepticism - models of life, fundamental forms in
accordance with which reason may be applied to human existence, and
archetypes of the quest for wisdom. It is precisely this plurality of ancient
schools that is precious. It allows us to compare the consequences of all the
various possible fundamental attitudes of reason, and offers a privileged
field for experimentation. This, of course, presupposes that we reduce
these philosophies to their spirit and essence, detaching them from their
outmoded cosmological or mythical elements, and disengaging from them the
fundamental propositions that they themselves considered essential. This is
not, by the way, a matter of choosing one or the other of these traditions
to the exclusion of the others. Epicureanism and Stoicism, for example,
correspond to two opposite but inseparable poles of our inner life:
the demands of our moral conscience, and the flourishing of our joy in
existing.31
Philosophy in antiquity was an exercise practiced at each instant. It invites
us to concentrate on each instant of life, to become aware of the infinite value
of each present moment, once we have replaced it within the perspective of
the cosmos. The exercise of wisdom entails a cosmic dimension. Whereas the
average person has lost touch with the world, and does not see the world qua
world, but rather treats the world as a means of satisfying his desires, the sage
never ceases to have the whole constantly present to mind. He thinks and acts
within a cosmic perspective. He has the feeling of belonging to a whole which
goes beyond the limits of his individuality. In antiquity, this cosmic consciousness
was situated in a different perspective from that of the scientific
knowledge of the universe that could be provided by, for instance, the science
of astronomical phenomena. Scientific knowledge was objective and mathematical,
whereas cosmic consciousness was the result of a spiritual exercise,
which consisted in becoming aware of the place of one's individual existence
within the great current of the cosmos and the perspective of the whole, Ioli
se inserens mundo, in the words of Seneca.32 This exercise was situated not in
the absolute space of exact science, but in the lived experience of the concrete,
living, and perceiving subject.
We have here to do with two radically different kinds of relationship to the
world. We can understand the distinction between these two kinds by
recalling the opposition pointed out by HusserP3 between the rotation of the
earth, affirmed and proved scientifically, and the earth's immobility, postulated
both by our day-to-day experience and by transcendental/ constitutive
consciousness. For the latter, the earth is the immobile ground of our life, the
reference point of our thought, or, as Merleau-Ponty put it, "the womb of
our time and of our space." :w In the same way, nature and the cosmos are,
for our livintit llcrccption, the infinite horizon of our lives, the enigma of our
274 Themes
existence which, as Lucretius said, inspires us with ho"or et divina voluptas,
a shudder and a divine pleasure. As Goethe put it in admirable verses:
The best part of man is the shudder.
However dearly the world makes him pay for this emotion,
He is seized by amazement when he feels the Prodigious. 35
Ancient philosophical traditions can provide guidance in our relationship to
ourselves, to the cosmos, and to other human beings. In the mentality of
modem historians, there is no cliche more firmly anchored, and more difficult
to uproot, than the idea according to which ancient philosophy was an escape
mechanism, an act of falling back upon oneself. In the <."Ilse of the Platonists,
it was an escape into the heaven of ideas, into the refusal of politics in the
case of the Epicureans, into the submission to fate in the case of the Stoics.
This way of looking at things is, in fact, doubly false. In the first place,
ancient philosophy was always a philosophy practiced in a group, whether in
the case of the Pythagorean communities, Platonic love, Epicurean friendship,
or Stoic spiritual direction. Ancient philosophy required a common effort,
community of research, mutual assistance, and spiritual support. Above all,
philosophers - even, in the last analysis, the Epicureans - never gave up
having an effect on their cities, transforming society, and serving their
citizens, who frequently accorded them praise, the vestiges of which are
preserved for us by inscriptions. Political ideas may have differed from school
to school, but the concern for having an effect on city or state, king or
emperor, always remained constant. This is particularly true of Stoicism, and
can easily be seen in many of the texts of Marcus Aurelius. Of the three tasks
which must be kept in mind at each instant, alongside vigilance over one's
thoughts and consent to the events imposed by destiny, an essential place is
accorded to the duty always to act in the service of the human community;
that is, to act in accordance with justice. This last requirement is, moreover,
intimately linked to the two others. It is one and the same wisdom which
conforms itself to cosmic wisdom and to the reason in which human beings
participate. This concern for living in the service of the human community,
and for acting in accordance with justice, is an essential element of every
philosophical life. In other words, the philosophical life normally entails a
communitary engagement. This last is probably the hardest part to carry out.
The trick is to maintain oneself on the level of reason, and not allow oneself
to be blinded by political passions, anger, resentments, or prejudices. To he
sure, there is an equilibrium - almost impossible to achieve - between the
inner peace brought about by wisdom, and the passions to which the sight of
the injustices, sufferings, and misery of mankind cannot help but give rise.
Wisdom, however, consists in precisely such nn equ ilibrium, nnd inner l'cnce
is indispensable for cnicnciuu11 act ion .
Philosophy as a Way of Life 275
Such is the lesson of ancient philosophy: an invitation to each human being
to transform himself. Philosophy is a conversion, a transformation of one's
way of being and living, and a quest for wisdom. This is not an easy matter.
As Spinoza wrote at the end of the Ethics:
If the way which I have pointed out as leading to this result seems
exceedingly hard, it may nevertheless be discovered. It must indeed be
hard, since it is so seldom found. How would it be possible, if salvation
were easy to find, and could without great labour be found, that it
should be neglected by almost everybody? But all excellent things are as
difficult as they are rare.36

Postscript: An Interview with Pierre
Hadot
M.C. Pierre Hadot, you were born in Reims, France, in 1922. What were
the earliest and strongest influences on your spiritual and intellectual development?

P.H. I received a very intense Catholic religious education. I gradually
became detached from it, but it played a considerable role in my formation,
both because of the first impressions it made upon me, and because of the
problems it raised for me.
The first philosophy I came across was Thomism, which I encountered
especially in the books of Jacques Maritain; thus it was a kind of Aristotelianism
tinged with Neoplatonism. I think it was a good thing for me to have
begun my philosophical studies with a highly systematic, structured philosophy,
which was based on a long ancient and medieval tradition. It gave me
a lasting distaste for philosophies which don't clearly define the vocabulary
they use. Besides, it was thanks to Thomism, and especially to Etienne
Gilson,! that I discovered very early on the fundamental distinction between
essence and existence, which is dear to existentialism.
At the time, I was very much influenced by Newman's Grammar of Assent.
Newman shows in this work that it's not the same thing to give one's assent
to an affirmation which one understands in a purely abstract way, and to give
one's assent while engaging one's entire being, and "realizing" - in the
English sense of the word - with one's heart and one's imagination, just what
this affirmation means for us. This distinction between real and notional
assent underlies my research on spiritual exercises.
My religious education also made me come face to face with the phenomenon
of mysticism, which I probably didn't understand at the time, but which
has continued to fascinate me all my life.
We would need a very long discussion if we were seriously to approach the
problem posed by the survival of Christianity in the modern world. From the
point of view of my uwn personal experience, I can say that one of the great
278 Postscript
difficulties of Christianity - I'm thinking here of the textual criticism of the
Bible - was what revealed to me a more general problem, which could be
formulated in the following terms: is modem man still able to understand the
texts of antiquity, and live according to them? Has there been a definitive
break between the contemporary world and ancient tradition?
While studying at the Sorbonne in 1946 and 1947, I discovered Bergson,
Marxism, and existentialism, three models which have had a strong influence
on my conception of philosophy. Bergsonism was not an abstract, conceptual
philosophy, but rather took the form of a new way of seeing the world, and
of transforming one's perception. Existentialism - Heidegger, Sartre, MerleauPonty,
Albert Camus; but also Gabriel Marcel - made me become aware of
my simultaneous engagement in the world of experience, in perception, in the
experience of my body, and in social and political life. Marxism, finally,
proposed a theory of philosophy in which theory and praxis were intimately
linked, and where daily life was never separated from theoretical reflection. I
found this aspect of Marxism very seductive, but economic materialism was
profoundly alien to me. I also had other influences: Montaigne, whom I have
been reading since my adolescence, and the poet Rilke; for a while, I thought
about writing my thesis on "The Relationship between Rilke and Heidegger."
M. C. Your career has always taken place more or less on the outskirts of the
French intellectual "establishment." You took your diploma from the Ecole
Pratique des Hautes Etudes in 1961, and you then became director of studies
at the same institution, where you remained from 1964 on. In 1 982, you were
elected to the chair of the History of Hellenistic and Roman Thought at the
College de France. Now, in France, this is the most prestigious position
which a historian of philosophy can obtain, and ou arrived there without
passing through the almost obligatory stage of the cole Normale Superieure,
or any other of the so-called "great schools."
Did these somewhat unusual circumstances contribute anything to your
conception of philosophy? I'm thinking in particular of your remarks on the
negative influence which the university has exerted on philosophy.
P.H. My remarks on the negative influence which the university has exerted
on philosophy have nothing to do with the fact that my career has taken place
outside the university. Generally speaking, I admired the professors who
taught me philosophy at the Sorbonne, from either an intellectual or a human
point of view - or both. They devoted themselves to the task of teaching with
exemplary dedication, and they had a highly-developed moral conscience. I'm
thinking here of men like Emile Brehier,2 R. Bayer, jean Wahl,3 Paul Ricoeur,
Maurice de Gandillac,• Jean Hyppolite,5 R. Le Senne, Louis Lavelle, Maurice
Merlcau-Ponty, and j. Vuillemin.
The idea of a conflict between philosophy and the teaching of philosophy
goes back to my youth. I think I came across it in C:h11rlcs Pc((uy, who said :
"Philosophy doesn't go to philosophy d111111c11," 1md l:crt11inly in j&1ClJUC11
Postscript 279
Maritain, who wrote: "Thomist metaphysics is called 'Scholastic' after its
most severe trial. Scholastic pedagogy is its own worst enemy: it always has
to triumph over its intimate adversary, the professor." Ever since I started
doing philosophy, I've always believed that philosophy was a concrete act,
which changed our perception of the world, and our life: not the construction
of a system. It is a life, not a discourse.
M. C. Your own philosophical trajectory is rather remarkable. To begin
with, in the 1950s, you wrote reviews of Wittgenstein, Heidegger, and
Berdiaev. At the same time, you were making a name for yourself on the one
hand in Latin Patristics and textual criticism, and on the other as a specialist
on Plotin us. In 19 57, you presented a remarkable paper at the meeting of the
Fondation Hardt devoted to Plotinus; this was followed, in 1 963 by your first
book, Plotinus or the Simplicity of Vision.6 In 1961, in collaboration with Paul
Henry, you had translated and given a copious commentary on the theological
treatises of the Latin church Father Marius Victorious. The year 1 968 saw
the publication of your monumental work Porphyre et Victorinus,1 in which
you gave a critical edition, with translation and commentary, of a commentary
on Plato's Parmenides, which you attributed for the first time to Porphyry of
Tyre. But this wasn't all; the work contained a summa of Neoplatonic
metaphysics, in which you covered the immensely complex, hierarchic
conceptual constructions of post-Plotinian metaphysics. After you were
named to the College de France, you devoted your attention mainly to the
seemingly more simple philosophies of Stoicism and Epicureanism, as well as
continuing your study of Plotinus.
Perhaps your career could be summed up as follows: beginning with the
bone-dry discipline of textual criticism, you then moved on to master the
ontological complexities of Neoplatonism; surely among the most complicated
creations of the human spirit. Then, however, it's as if you had turned back,
in a way, to your point of departure: from this point on, it's no longer the
great speculative edifices which occupy your attention, but those philosophers
who teach us how to live: Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus, Lucretius, and, of
course, your beloved Plotinus. Wouldn't you say that your own philosophical
trajectory can serve as a paradigm for the "return to simplicity," the
importance of which you have stressed in your teaching?
P.H. I'd be inclined to look at my intellectual and spiritual itinerary
somewhat differently. From 1942 to 1946, I was only interested in metaphysics
and in mysticism, in all their forms: Christian first and foremost, but
also Arabic, Hindu, and Neoplatonist. It was my interest in mysticism that
led me to Plotinus, and to the great Plotinian specialist Paul Henry. I went
to see him in 1 946, so that he could guide me in my Plotinian studies. He
was interested, above all, in the influence of Plotinus on St Augustine, and
on Christianity in general; he had written a book on the subject entitled Plotin
et / 'OcciJmt." He ndvised me to study Marius Victorious, in the belief that I
280 Postscript
would find, in the almost incomprehensible Latin of this ecclesiastical author,
some translated fragments of Plotinus. He suggested that we edit the
theological works of Victorious together, leaving the translation and the
commentary up to me. Thus, he was the one who initiated me to textual
criticism and philological studies; being a pure philosopher, I had had no
preparation in either of these fields, and the only knowledge I had of Greek
and Latin was what I had been taught by my secondary-school teachers.
All this was a long way from mysticism. I can say that I worked for twenty
years on a subject that I had not chosen; I was interested in it, of course, but
not fascinated by it. It was then that I learned how to read Latin manuscripts
and, thanks to Paul Henry, how to prepare a critical edition. I also tried to
understand, and explain as well as I could, the text of Victorious. My book
Porphyre et Victorinus was the result of this exegetical work, and in it I showed
that Victorious was the disciple of Porphyry rather than of Plotinus.
What attracted me in Wittgenstein - whom I first read around 1 960 - was
the problem of mysticism, which he mentions in the last pages of the
Tractalus. My reading of Wittgenstein was very stimulating for me, and it
brought about my lasting interest in the question of "language games," which
are, he tells us, "forms of life." These ideas had a great deal of influence on
my subsequent studies of ancient philosophy.
I returned to the mysticism of Plotinus in 1963, when Georges and Angele
de Radkowski asked me to write the little book entitled Plotin ou la simplicite
du regard.
When, in 1 964, I was elected to the Fifth Section of the Ecole Pratique des
Hautes Etudes,9 my colleagues viewed me above all as the translator of
Victorin us, and it was natural for me to have been elected to the chair of Latin
Patristics. Among other factors, this explains how I came to publish an edition
and translation of the Apologia David of Bishop Ambrose of Milan.10 I must
confess, however, that Latin Patristics didn't really interest me. Fortunately,
my colleagues agreed to change the title of my chair, which became
"Theologies and Mysticisms of Hellenistic Greece and of the End of
Antiquity." Thus I was able to return to the mystical passages of Plotinus, on
which I commented before my auditors for many years.
However, it was also at this time that my relationship with Plotinus began
to become more complex, and that I arrived at my present position. On the
one hand, I believe that this great author has yet to be explained in the
detailed way he deserves, and that's why I have undertaken the translation
with commentary of the totality of his works. Moreover, the phenomenon of
mysticism, which is so striking in Plotinus, continues to intrigue me. Y ct, as
I grow older, Plotinus speaks to me less and less, if I may say so. I have
become considerably detached from him. From 1 970 on, I have felt very
strongly that it was Epicurcnnism and Stoicism which could nouri11h the
spi ritual life of men and women of our times, 1111 well 1111 my own. Tlllll w1111
Postscript 281
how I came to write my book on spiritual exercises. Indeed, here at the end
of the century - and no one is more surprised at this than myself - we are
witnessing an increasing interest in these two philosophies on the part of the
reading public. This is a remarkable phenomenon, hard to explain.
To sum up my inner evolution, I would say the following: in 1946, I naively
believed that I, too, could relive the Plotinian mystical experience. But I later
realized that this was an illusion. The conclusion of my book Plotinus already
hinted that the idea of the "purely spiritual" is untenable. It is true that there
is something ineffable in human existence, but this ineffable is within our very
perception of the world, in the mystery of our existence and that of the
cosmos. Still, it can lead to an experience which could be qualified as mystical.
M.C. What do the expressions "philosophy" and "living a philosophical
life" signify for you?
P.H. For me, the word "philosophy" corresponds first of all to an historical
phenomenon. In was the Greeks who created the word, probably in the sixth
or fifth century BC, and it was Plato who gave it its strongest meaning:
philo-sophia, "love of wisdom," the wisdom which one lacks. Since that time
there has been an intellectual, spiritual, and social phenomenon, which has
taken on a variety of forms, and which has been called philosophy. From this
point of view, it is legitimate to ask whether there exists a "philosophy"
outside of the Western tradition, or of the Arabic tradition, insofar as the
latter is the inheritor of Greek philosophy.
Now, an historical phenomenon is in constant evolution. Contemporary
"philosophy" is obviously very different from the "philosophy" of Socrates
and Plato, just as contemporary Christianity is very different from the
Evangelistic message. Is this evolution a good thing? Is it an evil? I won't go
into that. I do think, however, that it is always legitimate to go back to the
origins, in order better to understand the meaning of a phenomenon, and that
is what I try to do.
I have tried to define what philosophy was for a person in antiquity. In my
view, the essential characteristic of the phenomenon "philosophy" in antiquity
was that at that time a philosopher was, above all, someone who lived in a
philosophical way. In other words, the philosopher was someone whose life
was guided by his or her reason, and who was a practitioner of the moral
virtues. This is obvious, for example, from the portrait Alcibiades gives of
Socrates at the end of Plato's Symposium. We can also observe it in Xenophon,
where Hippias asks Socrates for a definition of justice. Socrates replies:
"Instead of talking about it, I make it appear through my actions." Originally,
then, philosophy is above all the choice of a form of life, to which
philosophical discourse then gives justifications and theoretical foundations.
Philosophical discourse is not the same thing as philosophy: the Stoics said
so explicitly, and the other schools admitted it implicitly. True, there can be
no philosophy without some discourse - either inner or outward - on the part
282 Postscript
of the philosopher. This can take the fonn of pedagogical activity carried out
on others, of inner meditation, or of the discursive explanation of intuitive
contemplation. But this discourse is not the essential part of philosophy, and
it will have value only if it has a relationship with philosophical life. As an
Epicurean sentence puts it: "The discourse of philosophers is in vain, unless
it heals some passion of the soul."
M.C. Are spiritual exercises still possible today? They were thought up in
the very distant past, as responses to specific social structures and material
conditions, but our current living conditions bear very little resemblance to
those of antiquity. The spiritual exercises of the Stoics and the Epicureans,
for example, are the consequences of the basic hypotheses of each school: on
the one hand, faith in the providential Logos; on the other, atomism, belief
in chance, and denial of post-mortem existence. Nowadays, however, we may
no longer believe in these hypotheses. Is it still possible to practice the
spiritual exercises of antiquity, separating them from the systems of which
they were a part, and substituting our own basic hypotheses for the outmoded
ones of antiquity?
Let's take the example of injustice. One of the greatest sources of pain for
modern man is, I would think, the suffering of innocent people. Every day,
the media overwhelm us with images of this suffering, and we witness it every
day in the streets of our cities. How can we avoid giving in to despair if we
no longer believe, like Marcus Aurelius, in a divine providence, consubstantial
with ourselves, which arranges everything for the best, and ensures that
injustices are only apparent?
P.H. To reply to your question, I refer you to the beginning of the chapter
entitled "Spiritual exercises," where I quote the passage from the diary of
Georges Friedmann which he quotes in his book La Puissance et la Sagesse:11
"A 'spiritual exercise' every day - either alone or else in the company of
someone who also wants to improve himself. ... Step out of duration ... try
to get rid of your own passions." I think this testimony suffices to prove that
spiritual exercises arc still being practiced in our day and age.
Spiritual exercises do not correspond to specific social structures or material
conditions. They have been, and continue to be, practiced in every age, in the
most widely diverse milieus, and in widely different latitudes: China, Japan,
India; among the Christians, Muslims, and Jews.
If one admits, as I do, that the various philosophical schools of antiquity
were characterized above all by their choice of a form of life, which is then
justified after the fact by a given systematic construction (for instance,
Stoicism is the choice of an attitude of coherence with oneself, which is later
justified by a general theory of the coherence of the universe with itself) -
then it is easy to understand how one can can remain faithful to one'
s choice
of a form of life without being obliged to adhere to the systemat ic construction
which claims to found it. As Ruyer haH w1·inen112 "Excel'' for s1,cc:iali111s,
Postscript 283
no one is very interested in the motives of Stoicism, taken over for the most
part from Heraclitus, or in those of Epicurean ethics or Democritean
atomism. Nevertheless, as attitudes, Stoicism and Epicureanism are still very
much alive." As a matter of fact, ethics - that is to say, choosing the good -
is not the consequence of metaphysics, but metaphysics is the consequence of
ethics.
You give the example of injustice and the suffering of innocent people. For
Marcus Aurelius, the fact that there is a providence (that is, simply, that there
is coherence in the world), does not mean that injustice is only an appearance.
It is quite real, and in his Meditations Marcus often expresses his anger against
liars and the unjust. For him, the discipline of action consists precisely in
acting in the service of the human community; in other words, in practicing
justice oneself and in correcting injustices. Such an attitude is independent of
any theory of providence. Besides, Marcus himself says: "Whether or not the
world is ruled by reason (and thus by providence), don't you act unreasonably.
" He then goes on to add that if we do act according to reason, that
proves that there is also reason in the world. This is proof that it is one's
choice of life which precedes metaphysical theories, and that we can make our
choice of life, whether or not we justify it by improved or entirely new
arguments.
M. C. You often speak of "nature" or "universal nature" in the context of
the triple discipline of the Stoics. For example, according to Marcus Aurelius
we must learn "the ways and laws of . nature." What is meant here by
"nature"? Is it the "nature" in which we stroll and have picnics? The "nature"
which "makes no leaps"?
P.H. For the Stoics, nature is at the same time the program in conformity
with which the events which constitute the universe are necessarily linked to
one another, and the programmed sequence which results from them. Thus,
it is the rational order which presides over the evolution of the visible world.
It is this programming and this rationality which give the world its coherence.
To act according to nature is therefore to act in a programmed, rational
manner, in full awareness of the fact that one is a part of the cosmic whole,
as well as a part of the whole formed by the city ofl:hose beings which share
in reason. On the one hand, then, it is to act in the service of the human
community, and, on the other, to consent to the general movement of the
universe. The Stoics were saying exactly the same thing as Einstein, when he
denounced the optical illusion of a person who imagines himself to be a
separate entity, while he is really a part of that whole which we call the
universe. Einstein also declared that it is our duty to open our hearts to all
living beings, and to all of nature in her magnificence.
M. C. The triple discipline of spiritual exercises is intended to lead me
towards the inner transformation of my way of seeing, and eventually, to
restore me ns nn integrnl and integrated part of the cosmos. According to this
284 Postscript
theory, my task is to discipline my desires, my inclinations, and my assent.
The last two domains correspond respectively to ethics - I must observe my
duties toward my fellow citizens - and to logic or epistemology: I must accept
as true only that which is freed from my subjective prejudices.
All this seems feasible enough. But as far as the discipline of desire is
concerned: it is surely true that the majority of our unhappiness comes from
our unsatisfied desires; this was taught by the Buddha, among others. But is
it really possible for me to discipline my desires; that is, to persuade myself
by means of rational considerations no longer to desire a particular object?
Let's take sexual desire as an example. If I feel desire for a woman, it is
perfectly possible for me to tell myself that I will not act according to "'J' desire;
in other words, that I will not attempt to satisfy my desire. But can I really
go further than that, and, in the presence of the desired object, command
myself not to desire it at{v longer? I have difficulties with this point.
P.H. Can purely rational considerations be effective against passion or
sexual desire? Here we return to the very idea of spiritual exercises.
What's interesting about the idea of spiritual exercises is precisely that it is nor
a matter of a purely rational consideration, but the putting in action of all kinds
of means, intended to act upon one's self. Imagination and affectivity play a
capital role here: we must represent to ourselves in vivid colors the dangers of
such-and-such a passion, and use striking formulations of ideas in order to exhort
ourselves. We must also create habits, and fortify ourselves by preparing
ourselves against hardships in advance. In Epicurean communities, people help
one another, admit their weaknesses to each other, and warn others of such-andsuch
a dangerous tendency which is beginning to manifest itself in them.
All these techniques can be useful in crisis situations. Yet we must not allow
them to make us forget that what is most important is the profound
orientation of our lives, the fundamental choice of a life, which engages us
passionately. The problem is not so much to repress such-and-such a passion,
as it is to learn to see things "from above," in the grandiose perspective of
universal nature and of humanity, compared to which many passions may
appear ridiculously insignificant. It is then that rational knowledge may
become force and will, and thereby become extremely efficacious.
M.C. On May 22, 1 991, you gave your last lecture at the College de France.
After some three decades of teaching, the last words you pronounced in
public were: "In the last analysis, we can scarcely talk about what is most
important."
This seems paradoxical . After a lifetime devoted to humanistic studies, have
you finally come to the conclusion of the Neoplatonist philosopher Damascius,13
who wrote "What will be the limit of our discourse, if it is nut an
impotent silence, and the admission of our absolute lack of knowledge
concerning those things about which we mny never gnin knowlcdl(c, Hince
they ore inncce1111iblc11?
Postsm'pt 285
P.H. You'
re alluding to the last words of my last class: "In the final analysis,
we can scarcely talk about what is most important." I was saying that about
Plotinus, for whom the most important thing was not his teaching, but the
unutterable experience of union with the One. For Plotinus, abstract teaching
could allude to this experience, but could not lead to it. Only asceticism and
a moral life could truly prepare the soul for such a union (and here again, we
find the same opposition between philosophical discourse and the philosophical
life).
Obviously, however, when I used this phrase, I was hinting at my own
experience as a teacher and my experience of life. I wasn't only talking about
the experience of the ineffable among the Neoplatonists, but about a more
general experience.
Everything which is "technical" in the broad sense of the term, whether we
arc talking about the exact sciences or the humanistic sciences, is perfectly able
to be communicated by teaching or conversation. But everything that touches
the domain of the existential - which is what is most important for human
beings - for instance, our feeling of existence, our impressions when faced by
death, our perception of nature, our sensations, and a fortiori the mystical
experience, is not directly communicable. The phrases we use to describe them
are conventional and banal; we realize this when we try to console someone
over the loss of a loved one. That's why it often happens that a poem or a
biography are more philosophical than a philosophical treatise, simply because
they allow us to glimpse this unsayable in an indirect way. Here again, we find
the kind of mysticism evoked in Wittgenstein's Tractatus: "There is indeed the
inexpressible. This shows itself; it is the mystical."

COURAGE UNDER FIRE
Testing Epictetus's Doctrines in
a Laboratory of Human Behavior
James Bond Stockdale
I came to the philosophic life as a thirt y - e i g h t - y e a r-old naval pilot
in grad school at Stanford University. I had been in the navy for
twenty years and scarcely ever out of a cockpit. In 1962, I began
my second year of studying international relations so I could become
a strategic planner in the Pentagon. But my heart wasn’t in it. I had
yet to be inspired at Stanford and saw myself as just pro c e s s i n g
tedious material about how nations organized and governed themselves.
I was too old for that. I knew how political systems operated;
I had been beating systems for years.
Then, in what we call a “feel out pass” in stunt flying, I cru i s e d
into Stanford ’s philosophy corner one winter morning. I was grayh
a i red and in civilian clothes. A voice boomed out of an off i c e ,
“Can I help you?” The speaker was Philip Rhinelander, dean of
Humanities and Sciences, who taught Philosophy 6: The Pro b l e m s
of Good and Evil.
At first he thought I was a professor, but we soon found common
ground in the navy because he’d served in World War II. Within
fifteen minutes we’d agreed that I would enter his two-term course
in the middle, and to make up for my lack of background, I would
meet him for an hour a week for a private tutorial in the study of
his campus home.
Speech delivered at the Great Hall, King's College, London, Monday, November 15,
1993.
Courage under Fire James Bond Stockdale 1
Phil Rhinelander opened my eyes. In that study it all happened
for me––my inspiration, my dedication to the philosophic life. Fro m
then on, I was out of international relations––I already had enough
c redits for the master’s––and into philosophy. We went from Job to
Socrates to Aristotle to Descartes. And then on to Kant, Hume,
D o s t o y e v s k y, Camus. All the while, Rhinelander was psyching me
out, trying to figure out what I was seeking. He thought my intere s t
in Hume’s Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion was quite intere s t -
ing. On my last session, he reached high in his wall of books and
b rought down a copy of The Enchiridion. He said, “I think you’ll be
i n t e rested in this.”
E n c h i r i d i o n means “ready at hand.” In other words, it’s a hand
book. Rhinelander explained that its author, Epictetus, was a very
unusual man of intelligence and sensitivity, who gleaned wisdom
rather than bitterness from his early firsthand exposure to extre m e
c ruelty and firsthand observations of the abuse of power and selfindulgent
debauchery.
Epictetus was born a slave in about A.D. 50 and grew up in Asia
Minor speaking the Greek language of his slave mother. At the age
of fifteen or so, he was loaded off to Rome in chains in a slave
caravan. He was treated savagely for months while en route. He
went on the Rome auction block as a permanent cripple, his knee
having been shattered and left untreated. He was “bought cheap”
by a freedman named Epaphroditus, a secre t a ry to Emperor Nero .
He was taken to live at the Nero White House at a time when the
e m p e ror was neglecting the empire as he frequently toured Gre e c e
as actor, musician, and chariot race driver. When home in Rome
in his personal quarters, Nero was busy having his half-bro t h e r
killed, his wife killed, his mother killed, his second wife killed.
F i n a l l y, it was Epictetus’s master Epaphroditus who cut Nero ’s t h ro a t
when he fumbled his own suicide as the soldiers were breaking d o w n
his door to arrest him.
That put Epaphroditus under a cloud, and, fort u i t o u s l y, the now
cagey slave Epictetus realized he had the run of Rome. And being a
serious and doubtless disgusted young man, he gravitated to the highminded
public lectures of the Stoic teachers who w e re t h e
philosophers of Rome in those days. Epictetus eventually became
a p p renticed to the very best Stoic teacher in the empire, Musonius
Courage under Fire 2
Rufus, and, after ten or more years of study, achieved the status of
philosopher in his own right. With that came true freedom in Rome,
and the preciousness of that was duly celebrated by the former slave.
Scholars have calculated that in his works individual freedom is
praised six times more frequently than it is in the New Te s t a m e n t .
The Stoics held that all human beings were equal in the eyes of
G od: male/female, black/white, slave and fre e .
I read every one of Epictetus’s extant writings twice, thro u g h
two translators. Even with the most conservative translators, Epictetus
comes across speaking like a modern person. It is “living
speech,” not the literary Attic Greek we’re used to in men of that
tongue. The E n c h i r i d i o n was actually penned not by Epictetus, who
was above all else a determined teacher and man of modesty who
would never take the time to transcribe his own lectures, but by
one of his most meticulous and determined students. The student’s
name was Arrian, a very smart, aristocratic Greek in his twenties.
After hearing his first few lectures, he is reported to have exclaimed
something like, “Son of a gun! We’ve got to get this guy down on
parchment!”
With Epictetus’s consent, Arrian took down his words verbatim
in some kind of frantic shorthand he devised. He bound the lectures
into books; in the two years he was enrolled in Epictetus’s school,
he filled eight books. Four of them disappeared sometime before the
Middle Ages. It was then that the remaining four got bound together
under the title Discourses of Epictetus. Arrian put The Enchiridion
together after he had finished the eight. It is just highlights fro m
them “for the busy man.” Rhinelander told me that last morn i n g ,
“As a military man, I think you’ll have a special interest in this.
F rederick the Great never went on a campaign without a copy of
this handbook in his kit.”
I’ll never forget that day, and the essence of what that gre a t
man had to say as we said good-bye was burned into my brain, It
went very much like this: Stoicism is a noble philosophy that p ro v e d
m o re praticable than a mod e rn cynic would expect. The Stoic
viewpoint is often misunderstood because the casual reader misses
the point that all talk is in re f e rence to the “inner life” of man.
Stoics belittle physical harm, but this is not braggadocio. They are
speaking of it in comparison to the devastating agony of shame t h e y
3 James Bond Stockdale
fancied good men generating when they knew in their hearts that
they had f a i l e d to do their duty vis-à-vis their fellow men or God .
Although pagan, the Stoics had a monotheistic, natural re l i g i o n
and w e re great contributors to Christian thought. The fatherh o od
of G od and the bro t h e rh o od of man were Stoic concepts before
C h r i s t i a n i t y. In fact, one of their early theoreticians, named Chry -
sippus, made the analogy of what might be called the s o u l of the
universe to the b re a t h of a human, p n e u m a in Greek. This Stoic
conception of a celestial pneuma is said to be the gre a t - g r a n d f a t h e r
of the Christian Holy Ghost. Saint Paul, a Hellenized Jew bro u g h t
up in Tarsus, a Stoic town in Asia Minor, always used the Gre e k
w o rd p n e u m a, or breath, for “soul.”
Rhinelander told me that the Stoic demand for disciplined
thought naturally won only a small minority to its standard, but
that those few were every w h e re the best. Like its Christian count
e r p a rts, Calvinism and Puritanism, it produced the strongest characters
of its time. In theory, a doctrine of pitiless perfection, it
actually c reated men of courage, saintliness, and goodwill. Rhinelander
singled out three examples: Cato the Yo u n g e r, Emperor M a rcus
Aurelius, and Epictetus. Cato was the great Roman re p u b l i c a n
who pitted himself against Julius Caesar. He was the unmistakable
h e ro of George Washington; scholars find quotations of this man in
Wa s h i n g t o n ’s farewell addre s s––without quotation marks. Empero r
M a rcus Aurelius took the Roman Empire to the pinnacle of its
power a nd influence. And Epictetus, the great teacher, played his
p a rt in changing the leadership of Rome from the swill he had
known in the Nero White House to the power and decency it knew
under Marcus Aure l i u s .
M a rcus Aurelius was the last of the five emperors (all with Stoic
connections) who successively ruled throughout that period Edward
Gibbon described in his Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire a s
follows: “If a man were called upon to fix the period in the history
of the world during which the condition of the human race was
most happy and pro s p e rous, he would without hesitation name that
which elapsed from the accession of Nerva (a . d . 96) to the death of
M a rcus Aurelius (a . d . 180). The united reigns of the five emperors of
the era are possibly the only period of history in which the happiness
of a great people was the sole object of govern m e n t . ”
Courage under Fire 4
Epictetus drew the same sort of audience Socrates had drawn
five hundred years earlier––young aristocrats destined for careers in
finance, the arts, public service. The best families sent him their
best sons in their middle twenties––to be told what the good life
consisted of, to be disabused of the idea that they deserved to become
playboys, the point made clear that their job was to serve their
fellow men.
In his inimitable, frank language, Epictetus explained that his
curriculum was not about “revenues or income, or peace or war, but
about happiness and unhappiness, success and failure, slavery and
freedom.” His model graduate was not a person “able to speak fluently
about philosophic principles as an idle babbler, but about things
that will do you good if your child dies, or your brother dies, or if
you must die or be tort u red.” “Let others practice lawsuits, others
study p roblems, others syllogisms; here you practice how to die,
how to be enchained, how to be racked, how to be exiled.” A man
is responsible for his own “judgments, even in dreams, in dru n k -
enness, and in melancholy madness.” Each individual brings about
his own good and his own evil, his good fortune, his ill fortune, his
happiness, and his wretchedness. And to top all this off, he held
that it is u n t h i n k a b l e that one man’s error could cause another’s
s u ffering. Suffering, like everything else in Stoicism, was all down
h e re– – remorse at destroying y o u r s e l f.
So what Epictetus was telling his students was that there can be
no such thing as being the “victim” of another. You can only be a
“victim” of y o u r s e l f. It’s all in how you discipline your mind. Who is
your master? “He who has authority over a n y of the things on which
you have set your heart.” “What is the result at which all virt u e
aims? S e re n i t y.” “Show me a man who though sick is happy, who
though in danger is happy, who though in prison is happy, and I’ll
show you a Stoic.”
When I got my degree, Sybil and I packed up our four sons and
family belongings and headed to Southern California. I was to take
command of Fighter Squadron 51, flying supersonic F-8 Cru s a d e r s ,
first at the Miramar Naval Air Station, near San Diego, and later,
of course, at sea aboard various aircraft carriers in the western P a c i f i c .
Exactly three years after we drove up to our new home near San
Diego, I was shot down and captured in North Vietnam.
5 James Bond Stockdale
During those three years, I had launched on three seven-month
c ruises to the waters off Vietnam. On the first we were occupied
with general surveillance of the fighting erupting in the South; on
the second I led the first-ever American bombing raid against North
Vietnam; and on the third, I was flying in combat almost daily as
the air wing commander of the USS Oriskany. But on my bedside
table, no matter what carrier I was aboard, were my Epictetus books:
Enchiridion, Discourses, X e n o p h o n ’s M e m o r a b i l i a of Socrates, and
The Iliad and The Odyssey. (Epictetus expected his students to be
familiar with Homer’s plots.) I didn’t have time to be a bookworm ,
but I spent several hours each week buried in them.
I think it was obvious to my close friends, and certainly to me,
that I was a changed man and, I have to say, a better man for my
introduction to philosophy and especially to Epictetus. I was on a
d i ff e rent track––certainly not an antimilitary track but to some
extent an antiorganization track. Against the backdrop of all the
posturing and fumbling around peacetime military org a n i z a t i o n s
seem to have to go through, to accept the need for graceful and
u n s e l f -conscious improvisation under pre s s u re, to break away fro m
set procedures forces you to be reflective, reflective as you put a new
m ode of operation together. I had become a man detached––not
aloof but detached––able to throw out the book without the slightest
hesitation when it no longer matched the external circ u m s t a n c e s .
I was able to put juniors over seniors without embarrassment when
their wartime instincts were more reliable. This new abandon, this
new built-in flexibility I had gained, was to pay off later in prison.
But underg i rding my new confidence was the realization that I
had found the proper philosophy for the military arts as I practiced
them. The Roman Stoics coined the formula Vi v e re militare !– – “ L i f e
is being a soldier.” Epictetus in D i s c o u r s e s: “Do you not know that
life is a soldier’s service? One must keep guard, another go out to
reconnoitre, another take the field. If you neglect your responsibilities
when some severe order is laid upon you, do you not understand
to what a pitiful state you bring the army in so far as in you lies?”
E n c h i r i d i o n: “Remember, you are an actor in a drama of such sort as
the Author chooses––if short, then in a short one; if long, then in
a long one. If it be his pleasure that you should enact a poor man,
or a cripple, or a ru l e r, see that you act it well. For this is your
Courage under Fire 6
business––to act well the given part, but to choose it belongs to
A n o t h e r.” “Every one of us, slave or free, has come into this world
with innate conceptions as to good and bad, noble and shameful,
becoming and unbecoming, happiness and unhappiness, fitting and
inappropriate.” “If you regard yourself as a man and as a part of some
whole, it is fitting for you now to be sick and now to make a voyage
and run risks, and now to be in want, and on occasion to die before
your time. Why, then are you vexed? Would you have someone else
be sick of a fever now, someone else go on a voyage, someone else
die? For it is impossible in such a body as ours, that is, in this
universe that envelops us, among these fellow-cre a t u res of ours,
that such things should not happen, some to one man, some to
another.”
On September 9, 1965, I flew at 500 knots right into a flak trap,
at tree-top level, in a little A-4 airplane––the cockpit walls not
even three feet apart– –which I couldn’t steer after it was on fire, its
c o n t rol system shot out. After ejection I had about thirty seconds
to make my last statement in freedom before I landed in the main
s t reet of a little village right ahead. And so help me, I whispere d
to myself: “Five years down there, at least. I’m leaving the world of
technology and entering the world of Epictetus.”
“Ready at hand” from The Enchiridion as I ejected from that
airplane was the understanding that a Stoic always kept separate files
in his mind for (A) those things that are “up to him” and (B) those
things that are “not up to him.” Another way of saying it is (A)
those things that are “within his power” and (B) those things that
a re “beyond his power.” Still another way of saying it is (A) those
things that are within the grasp of “his Will, his Free Will” and (B)
those things that are beyond it. All in category B are “external,”
beyond my control, ultimately dooming me to fear and anxiety if I
covet them. All in category A are up to me, within my power,
within my will, and properly subjects for my total concern and
involvement. They include my opinions, my aims, my aversions,
my own grief, my own joy, my judgments, my attitude about what
is going on, my own good, and my own evil.
To explain why “your own good and your own evil” is on that
list, I want to quote Alexander Solzhenitsyn from his Gulag book.
He writes about that point in prison when he realizes the stre n g t h
7 James Bond Stockdale
of his residual powers, and starts what I called to myself “gaining
moral leverage”; riding the updrafts of occasional euphoria as you
realize you are getting to know yourself and the world for the first
time. He calls it “ascending” and names the chapter in which this
appears “The Ascent”:
It was only when I lay there on the rotting prison straw that I sensed
within myself the first stirrings of g o o d. Gradually it was disclosed to
me that the line separating good and evil passes not between states
nor between classes nor between political parties, but right thro u g h
e v e ry human heart, through all human hearts. And that is why I
t u rn back to the years of my imprisonment and say, sometimes to
the astonishment of those about me, “Bless you, prison, for having
been a part of my life.”
I came to understand that long before I read it. Solzhenitsyn
l e a rned, as I and others have learned, that good and evil are not
just abstractions you kick around and give lectures about and attribute
to this person and that. The only good and evil that means
anything is right in your own heart, within your will, within your
p o w e r, where it’s up to you. Enchiridion 32: “Things that are not
within our own power, not without our Will, can by no means be
either good or evil.” D i s c o u r s e s: “Evil lies in the evil use of moral
purpose, and good the opposite. The course of the Will determ i n e s
g o od or bad fortune, and one’s balance of misery and happiness.” In
s h o rt, what the Stoics say is “Work with what you have control of
and you’ll have your hands full.”
What is not up to you? beyond your power? not subject to your
will in the last analysis? For starters, let’s take “your station in life.”
As I glide down toward that little town on my short parachute ride,
I’m just about to learn how negligible is my control over my station
in life. It’s not at all up to me. I’m going right now from being the
leader of a hundred-plus pilots and a thousand men and, good n e s s
knows, all sorts of symbolic status and goodwill, to being an object
of c o n t e m p t. I’ll be known as a “criminal.” But that’s not h a l f t h e
revelation that is the realization of your own f r a g i l i t y—that you can
be reduced by wind and rain and ice and seawater or m e n to a
helpless, sobbing wreck—unable to control even your own bowels—
Courage under Fire 8
in a matter of m i n u t e s. And, more than even that, you’re going to face
fragilities you never before let yourself believe you could have––like
after mere minutes, in a flurry of action while being bound with
t o u rniquet-tight ropes, with care, by a professional, hands behind,
jackknifed forw a rd and down toward your ankles held secure in lugs
attached to an iron bar, that, with the onrush of anxiety, knowing
your upper bod y ’s circulation has been stopped and feeling the everg
rowing induced pain and the ever-closing-in of claustrophobia, you
can be made to blurt out answers, sometimes correct answers, to
questions about anything they know you know. (Here a f t e r, I’ll just
call that situation “taking the ro p e s . ” )
“Station in life,” then, can be changed from that of a dignified
and competent gentleman of culture to that of a panic-stricken,
sobbing, self-loathing wreck in a matter of minutes. So what? To
live under the false pretense that you will forever have control of
your station in life is to ride for a fall; you’re asking for disappointment.
So make sure in your heart of hearts, in your inner self, that
you treat your station in life with i n d i ff e re n c e, not with contempt,
only with i n d i ff e re n c e.
And so also with a long long list of things that some unre f l e c t i v e
people assume they’re assured of controlling to the last instance:
your bod y, pro p e rt y, wealth, health, life, death, pleasure, pain,
reputation. Consider “reputation,” for example. Do what you will,
reputation is at least as fickle as your station in life. O t h e r s d e c i d e
what your reputation is. Try to make it as good as possible, but don’t
get hooked on it. Don’t be ravenous for it and start chasing it in
tighter and tighter circles. As Epictetus says, “For what are tragedies
but the portrayal in tragic verse of the sufferings of men who have
a d m i red things external?” In your heart of hearts, when you get out
the key and open up that old rolltop desk where you really keep
your stuff, don’t let “reputation” get mixed up with your m o r a l
p u r p o s e or your will power; they a re i m p o rtant. Make sure “re p u t ation”
is in that box in the bottom drawer marked “matters of indiff
e rence.” As Epictetus says, “He who craves or shuns things not
under his control can neither be faithful nor free, but must himself
be changed and tossed to and fro and must end by subord i n a t i n g
himself to others.”
I know the difficulties of gulping this down right away. You keep
9 James Bond Stockdale
thinking of practical problems. Every b ody has to play the game of
life. You can’t just walk around saying, “I don’t give a damn about
health or wealth or whether I’m sent to prison or not.” Epictetus
took time to explain better what he meant. He says every b od y
should play the game of life––that the best play it with “skill, form ,
speed, and grace.” But, like most games, you play it with a ball.
Your team devotes all its energies to getting the ball across the line.
But after the game, what do you do with the ball? Nobody much
c a res. It’s not worth anything. The competition, the game, was the
thing. The ball was “used” to make the game possible, but it in itself
is not of any value that would justify falling on your sword for it.
Once the game is over, the ball is properly a matter of indiff e rence.
Epictetus on another occasion used the example of shooting
dice––the dice being matters of indiff e rence, once their numbers
had turned up. To exercise j u d g m e n t about whether to accept the
numbers or roll again is a w i l l f u l act, and thus n o t a matter of
i n d i ff e rence. Epictetus’s point is that our u s e of externals is not a
matter of indiff e rence because our actions are products of our will
and we totally control that, but that the dice themselves, like the
ball, are material over which we have no control. They are extern a l s
that we cannot aff o rd to covet or be earnest about, else we might
set our hearts on them and become slaves of such others as contro l
t h e m .
These explanations of this concept seem so mod e rn, yet I have
just given you practically verbatim quotes of Epictetus’s remarks to
his students in Nicopolis, colonial Greece, two thousand years ago.
So I took those core thoughts into prison; I also re m e m b e red a
lot of attitude-shaping remarks. Here ’s Epictetus on how to stay off
the hook: “A man’s master is he who is able to confer or re m o v e
whatever that man seeks or shuns. Whoever then would be fre e ,
let him wish nothing, let him decline nothing, which depends on
others; else he must necessarily be a slave.” And here ’s why never
to beg: “For it is better to die of hunger, exempt from fear and
guilt, than to live in affluence with perturbation.” Begging sets up
a demand for quid pro quos, deals, agreements, reprisals, the pits.
If you want to protect yourself from “fear and guilt,” and those
a re the crucial pincers, the real long-term destroyers of will, you
have to get rid of all your instincts to compromise, to meet people
Courage under Fire James Bond Stockdale 10
h a l f w a y. You have to learn to stand aloof, never give openings for
deals, never level with your adversaries. You have to become what
Ivan Denisovich called a “slow movin’ cagey prisoner. ”
All that, over the previous three years, I had u n k n o w i n g l y p u t
away for the future. So, to re t u rn to my bailing out of my A-4, I
can hear the noontime shouting and pistol shots and whining bullets
ripping my parachute canopy and see the fists waving in the stre e t
below as my chute hooks a tree but deposits me on the ground in
g o od shape. With two quick-release fastener flips, I’m free of the
parachute, and immediately gang tackled by the ten or fifteen town
roughnecks I had seen in my peripheral vision, pounding up the
road from my right.
I don’t want to exaggerate this or indicate that I was surprised
at my reception. It was just that when the gang tackling and pummeling
was all over, and it lasted for two or three minutes before a
man with a pith helmet got there to blow his police whistle, I had
a very badly broken leg that I felt sure would be with me for life.
My hunch turned out to be right. Later, I felt some relief––but only
m i n o r – – f rom another Epictetus admonition I re m e m b e red: “Lameness
is an impediment to the leg, but not to the Will; and say this
to yourself with re g a rd to everything that happens. For you will
find such things to be an impediment to something else, but not tru l y
to yourself.”
But during the time interval between pulling the ejection handle
and coming to rest on the street, I had become a man with a mission.
I can’t explain this without unloading a little emotional baggage
that was part of my military generation’s legacy in 1965.
In the aftermath of the Korean Wa r, just over ten years before ,
we all had memories of reading about, and seeing early television
news accounts of, U.S. government investigations into the behavior
of some American prisoners of war in North Korea and mainland
China. There was a famous series of articles in the New Yo r k e r
magazine that later became a book entitled In Every War but One.
The gist of it was that in prison camps for Americans, it was every
man for himself. Since those days, I’ve come to know officers who
w e re prisoners of war there, and I now see much of that as selective
re p o rting and as a bum rap. However, there were cases of young
soldiers who were confused by the times, scared to death, in cold
11 James Bond Stockdale
weather, treating each other like dogs fighting over scraps, throwing
each other out in the snow to die, and nobody doing anything about
it.
This could not go on, and President Eisenhower commissioned
the writing of the American Fighting Man’s Code of Conduct. It
is written in the form of a personal pledge. Article 4: “If I become
a prisoner of war, I will keep faith with my fellow prisoners. I will
give no information or take part in any action which might be
h a rmful to my comrades. If I am senior, I will take command. If
not, I will obey the lawful orders of those appointed over me and
will back them up in every way.” In other words, as of the moment
Eisenhower signed the document, American prisoners of war were
never to escape the chain of command; the war goes on behind
bars. As an insider, I knew the whole setup––that the North Vi e tnamese
already held about twenty-five prisoners, probably in Hanoi,
that I was the only wing commander to survive an ejection, and
that I would be their senior, their commanding off i c e r, and would
remain so, very likely, throughout this war that I felt sure would
last at least another five years. And here I was starting off crippled
and flat on my back.
Epictetus turned out to be right. After a very crude operation,
I was on crutches within a couple of months, and the crooked leg,
healing itself, was strong enough to hold me up without the cru t c h e s
in about a year. All told, it was only a temporary setback from things
that were important to me, and being cast in the role as the sovere i g n
head of an American expatriate colony that was destined to re m a i n
autonomous, out of communication with Washington, for years on
end was very important to me. I was forty-two years old––still on
c rutches, dragging a leg, at considerably less than my normal weight,
with hair down near my shoulders, my body unbathed since I had
been catapulted from the O r i s k a n y, a beard that had not seen a razor
since I arrived––when I took command (clandestinely, of course,
the North Vietnamese would never acknowledge our rank) of about
fifty Americans. That expatriate colony would grow to over four
h u n d red––all officers, all college graduates, all pilots or backseat
e l e c t ronic wizards. I was determined to “play well the given part . ”
The key word for all of us at first was “fragility.” Each of us,
b e f o re we were ever in shouting distance of another American, was
Courage under Fire 12
made to “take the ropes.” That was a real shock to our systems––
and, as with all shocks, its impact on our inner selves was a lot more
i m p ressive and lasting and important than to our limbs and torsos.
These were the sessions where we were taken down to submission,
and made to blurt out distasteful confessions of guilt and American
complicity into antique tape re c o rders, and then to be put in what
I call “cold soak,” a month or so of total isolation to “contemplate
our crimes.” What we actually contemplated was what even the
most laid-back American saw as his betrayal of himself and everything
he stood for. It was there that I learned what “Stoic Harm ”
meant. A shoulder broken, a bone in my back broken, a leg bro k e n
twice were p e a n u t s by comparison. Epictetus: “Look not for any
g reater harm than this: destroying the tru s t w o rt h y, self-re s p e c t i n g
well-behaved man within you.”
When put into a regular cell block, hardly an American came
out of that experience without responding something like this when
first whispered to by a fellow prisoner next door: “You don’t want
to talk to me; I am a traitor.” And because we were equally fragile,
it seemed to catch on that we all replied something like this: “Listen,
pal, there are no virgins in here. You should have heard the kind of
statement I made. Snap out of it. We ’ re all in this together. What’s
your name? Tell me about yourself.” To hear that last was, for most
new prisoners just out of initial shakedown and cold soak, a turn i n g
point in their lives.
But the new prisoner’s learning process was just beginning. Soon
enough he would realize that things were not at all like some had
told him in survival training––that if you made a good stiff showing
of resistance in the opening chapters, the interrogators would lose
i n t e rest in you and you would find yourself merely relegated to
b o redom, to “sitting out the war,” to “languishing in your cell,” as
the uninitiated novelists love to describe the predicament. No, the
war went on behind bars––there was no such thing as the jailers
giving up on you as a hopeless case. Their political beliefs m a d e
them believe you could be made to see things their way; it was just
a matter of time. And so you were marched to the interro g a t i o n
room endlessly, particularly on the occasions of your being apprehended
breaking one of the myriad rules that were posted on your
cell wall––“trip wire” rules, which paid dividends for the commissar
13 James Bond Stockdale
if his interrogator could get you to fall prey to his wedge of s h a m e.
The currency at the game table, where you and the interro g a t o r
faced one another in a duel of wits, was s h a m e, and I learned that
unless he could impose shame on me, or unless I imposed it on
myself, he had nothing going for him. (Force was available, but
that re q u i red the commissar’s okay. )
For Epictetus, emotions were acts of will. Fear was not something
that came out of the shadows of the night and enveloped you; he
charged you with the total responsibility of starting it, stopping it,
c o n t rolling it. This was one of Stoicism’s biggest demands on a
person. Stoics can be made to sound like lazy brutes when they are
described merely as people indiff e rent to most everything but good
and evil, people who make stingy use of emotions like pity and
s y m p a t h y. But add this re q u i rement of total personal re s p o n s i b i l i t y
for each and every one of your emotions, and you’re talking about
a person with his hands full. I whispered a “chant” to myself as I
was marched at gunpoint to my daily interrogation: “control fear,
c o n t rol guilt, control fear, control guilt.” And I devised methods of
deflecting my gaze to obscure such fear or guilt as doubtless emerg e d
in my eyes when I temporarily lost control under questioning. Yo u
could be bashed for failure to look at the face of your interro g a t o r ;
I concentrated on his left earlobe, and he seemed to get used to it––
thought I was a little cockeyed, pro b a b l y. Controlling your emotions
is difficult but can be e m p o w e r i n g. Epictetus: “For it is within you,
that both your destruction and deliverance lie.” Epictetus: “The
judgment seat and a prison is each a place, the one high, the other
low; but the attitude of your will can be kept the same, if you w a n t t o
keep it the same, in either place.”
We organized a clandestine society via our wall tap cod e – – a
society with our own laws, traditions, customs, even heroes. To
explain how it could be that we would order each other into more
t o rt u re, order each other to refuse to comply with specific demands,
intentionally call the bluff of our jailers and in a real sense forc e
them to repeat the full ropes process to another submission, I’ll
quote a statement that could have come from at least half of those
w o n d e rful competitive fly-boys I found myself locked up with: “We
a re in a spot like we’ve never been in before. But we deserve to
maintain our self-respect, to have the feeling we are fighting back.
Courage under Fire 14
We can’t refuse to do every degrading thing they demand of us, but
i t ’s up to you, boss, to pick out things we must all refuse to do unless
and until they put us through the ropes again. We deserve to sleep
at night. We at least deserve to have the satisfaction that we are
hewing to our leader’s orders. Give us the list; what are we to take
t o rt u re for?”
I know this sounds like strange logic, but in a sense it was a first
step in claiming what was rightfully o u r s. Epictetus said, “The judge
will do some things to you which are thought to be terrifying; but
how can he stop you f rom taking the punishment he thre a t e n e d ?”
T h a t ’s m y kind of Stoicism. You have a right to make them hurt
you, and they don’t like to do that. When my fellow prisoner Ev
A l v a rez, the very first pilot they captured, was released with the re s t
of us, the prison commissar told him: “You Americans were nothing
like the French; we could count on them to be reasonable.” Ha!
I put a lot of thought into what those first orders should be.
They would be orders that could be obeyed, not a “cover your ass”
move of reiterating some U.S. government policy like “name, rank,
serial number, and date of birth,” which had no chance of standing
up in the tort u re room. My mind-set was “we here under the gun
a re the experts, we are the masters of our fate, ignore guilt-inducing
echoes of hollow edicts, throw out the book and write your own.”
My orders came out as easy-to-remember acronyms. The principal
one was BACK US: Don’t Bow in public; stay off the Air; admit no
Crimes, never Kiss them goodbye. “US” could be interpreted as
United States, but it re a l l y meant “Unity over Self.” Loners make
out in an enemy’s prison, so my first rule of togetherness in there
was that each of us had to work at the lowest common denominator,
never negotiating for himself but only for a l l.
Prison life became a crazy mixture of an old regime and a new
one. The old was the political prison routine, mainly for dissenters
and domestic enemies of the state. It was designed and run by oldfashioned
Third World Communists of the Ho Chi Minh cut. It
revolved around the idea of “repentance” for your “crimes” of antisocial
behavior. American prisoners, street criminals, and domestic
political enemies of the state were all in the same prison. We never
saw a “POW camp” like the movies show. The communist jail was
p a rt psychiatric clinic and part re f o rm school. North Vietnam pro -

tocol called for making a l l their inmates demonstrate shame––bowing
to all guards, heads low, never looking at the sky, fre q u e n t
sessions with your interrogator if, for no other reason, to check your
a t t i t u d e and, if judged “wrong,” then maybe down the tort u re chute
of confession of guilt, of apology, and then the inevitable payoff of
a t o n e m e n t .
The new regime, superimposed on the above, was for Americans
o n l y. It was a propaganda factory, supervised by English-speaking
young bureaucratic army officers with quotas to fill, quotas set by
the political arm of the government: press interviews with visiting
left-wing Americans, propaganda films to shoot (starring intimidated
“American air pirates”), and so on.
An encapsulated history of how this bifurcated prison philosophy
fared is that the propaganda footage and interviews started to
b a c k f i re. Smart American college men were salting their acts with
sentences with double meanings, gestures read as funny-obscene by
We s t e rn audiences, and practical jokes. One of my best friends,
t o rt u red to give names of pilots he knew who had turned in their
wings in opposition to the war, said there were only two: Lieutenants
Clark Kent and Ben Casey (then-popular fictional characters in
America). That joke was headlined on the front page of the S a n
Diego Union, and somebody sent a copy back to the government in
Hanoi. As a result of that friendly gesture from a fellow American,
Nels Tanner went into three successive days of rope tort u re, followed
by 123 days in leg stocks, all while isolated of course.
So after several of these stunts, which cost the Vi e t n a m e s e
much loss of face, North Vietnam re s o rted to getting their pro p a -
ganda only from the relatively f e w (less than 5 percent) of the
Americans they could trust n o t to act up: real loners who, for
d i ff e rent reasons, never joined the prisoner organization, never
wanted to get into the tap code network, well-known sleaze balls
we came to call f i n k s. The vast majority of my constituents were
enraged by their actions and took it upon themselves to diligently
memorize data that would convict them in an American court -
m a rtial. But when we got home our government ruled against my
bringing charg e s .
The great mass of all other Americans in Hanoi were by all
s t a n d a rds “honorable prisoners,” but that is not to say there was
Courage under Fire 16
anything like a homogeneous prison regime we all shared. People
like to think that because we were all in the Hanoi prison system,
we had all these common experiences. It’s not so. These d i ff e r i n g
regimes became marked when our prison organization stultified the
p ropaganda eff o rts of this two-headed monster they called the “Prison
A u t h o r i t y.” They turned to vengeance against the leadership of my
o rganization and to an eff o rt to break down the morale of the others
by baiting them with an amnesty program in which they would
compete for early release by being compliant with North Vi e t n a m ’s
w i s h e s .
In May 1967, the public address system blared out: “Those of
you who repent, truly repent, will be able to go home before the
war is over. Those few diehards who insist on inciting the other
criminals to oppose the camp authority will be sent to a special dark
place.” I immediately put out an order forbidding any American to
accept early release, but that is not to say I was a lone man on a
white horse. I didn’t have to sell that one; it was accepted with
obvious relief and spontaneous jubilation by the overw h e l m i n g
m a j o r i t y.
Guess who went to the “dark place.” They isolated my leadership
team––me and my cohort of ten top men––and sent us into exile.
The Vietnamese worked very hard to learn our habits, and they
knew who were the troublemakers and who were “not making any
waves.” They isolated those I trusted most; every b ody had a long
re c o rd of solitary and rope-mark pedigrees. Not all were seniors; we
had seniors in prison who would not even communicate with the
man next door. One of my ten was only twenty-four years old––
b o rn after I was in the navy. He was a product of my recent shipboard
tendencies: “When instincts and rank are out of phase, take the
guy with the instincts.” All of us stayed in solitary thro u g h o u t ,
s t a rting with two years in leg irons in a little high-security prison
right beside North Vi e t n a m ’s “Pentagon”––their Ministry of Defense,
a typical old French building. There are chapters upon chapters
after that, but what they came down to in my case was a stru n g -
out vengeance fight between the “Prison Authority” and those of
us who refused to quit trying to be our brothers’ keepers. The stakes
g rew to n e rvous bre a k d o w n p ro p o rtions. One of the eleven of us died
in that little prison we called Alcatraz, but even including him,
17 James Bond Stockdale
t h e re was not a man who wound up with less than three and a half
years of solitary, and four of us had more than four years. To give
you a sense of pro p o rtion on how the total four hundred fared on
solo, one hundred had none, more than half of the other thre e
h u n d red had less than a year, and half of those with less than a year
had less than a month. So the average for the four hundred was
considerably less than six months.
Howie Rutledge, one of the four of us with more than four years,
went back to school and got a master’s degree after we got home,
and his thesis concentrated on the question of whether long-term
e rosion of human purpose was more effectively achieved by tort u re
or isolation. He mailed out questionnaires to us (who had also all
taken the ropes at least ten times) and others with re c o rds of extre m e
prison abuse. He found that those who had less than two years’
isolation and plenty of tort u re said tort u re was the trump card; those
with more than two years’ isolation and plenty of tort u re said that
for long-term modification of behavior, isolation was the way to go.
F rom my viewpoint, you can get used to repeated rope tort u re – –
t h e re are some tricks for minimizing your losses in that game. But
keep a man, even a very strong-willed man, in isolation for thre e
or more years, and he starts looking for a friend––a n y friend, re -
g a rdless of nationality or ideology.
Epictetus once gave a lecture to his faculty complaining about
the common tendency of new teachers to slight the stark realism of
S t o i c i s m ’s challenges in favor of giving the students an uplifting,
rosy picture of how they could meet the harsh re q u i rements of the
g o od life painlessly. Epictetus said: “Men, the lecture - room of the
philosopher is a hospital; students ought not to walk out of it in
p l e a s u re, but in pain.” If Epictetus’s lecture room was a hospital, my
prison was a laboratory––a laboratory of human behavior. I chose
to test his postulates against the demanding real-life challenges of
my laboratory. And as you can tell, I think he passed with flying
c o l o r s .
It’s hard to discuss in public the real-life challenges of that
laboratory because people ask all the wrong questions: How was the
fo od? That’s always the first one, and in a place like I’ve been, that’s
so far down the scale you want to cry. Did they harm you physically?
What was the nature of the d e v i c e they used to harm you? Always

the device or the truth serum or the electric shock tre a t m e n t – – a l l
of which would totally defeat the purpose of a person seriously trying
to break down your will. All those things would give y o u a feeling
of moral superiority, which is the last thing he would want to have
happen. I’m not talking about brainwashing; there is no such thing.
I’m talking about having looked over the brink and seen the bottom
of the pit and realized the truth of that linchpin of Stoic thought:
that the thing that brings down a man is not p a i n but s h a m e!
Why did those men in “cold soak” after their first rope trip eat
their hearts out and feel so unworthy when the first American
contacted them? Epictetus knew human nature well. In that prison
l a b o r a t o ry, I do not know of a single case where a man was able to
erase his conscience pangs with some laid-back pop psychology
t h e o ry of cause and effect. Epictetus emphasizes time and again that
a man who lays off the causes of his actions to third parties or forc e s
is not leveling with himself. He must live with his own judgments
if he is to be honest with himself. (And the “cold soak” tends to
make you honest.) “But if a person subjects me to fear of death, he
compels me,” says a student. “No,” says Epictetus, “It is neither
death, nor exile, nor toil, nor any such things that is the cause of
your doing, or not doing, a n y t h i n g, but only your opinions and the
decisions of your Will.” “What is the fruit of your doctrines?” someone
asked Epictetus. “Tr a n q u i l i t y, fearlessness, and freedom,” he
a n s w e red. You can have these only if you are honest and take
responsibility for your own actions. You’ve got to get it s t r a i g h t! Yo u
a re in charge of y o u.
Did I preach these things in prison? Certainly not. You soon
l e a rned that if the guy next door was doing okay, that meant that
he had all his philosophical ducks lined up in his own way. You soon
realized that when you dared to spout high-minded philosophical
suggestions through the wall, you always got a very reluctant response.
No, I never tapped or mentioned Stoicism once. But some sharp
guys read the signs in my actions. After one of my long isolations
outside the cell blocks of the prison, I was brought back into
signaling range of the fold, and my point of contact was a man
named Dave Hatcher. As was standard operating pro c e d u re on a
first contact after a long separation, we started off not with gushes
of news but with first, an agreed-upon danger signal, second, a cover
19 James Bond Stockdale
s t o ry for each of us if we were caught, and third, a backup communications
system if this link was compromised––“slow movin’
cagey prisoner” precautions. Hatcher’s backup communication for
me was a note drop by an old sink near a place we called the Mint,
the isolation cell block of Hatcher’s “Las Vegas” wing of the prison––
a place he rightly guessed I would soon enough be in. Every day we
would signal for fifteen minutes over a wall between his cell block
and my “no man’s land.”
Then I got back into trouble. At that time the commissar of
prisons had had me isolated and under almost constant surv e i l l a n c e
for the year since I had staged a riot in Alcatraz to get us out of leg
i rons. I was barred from all prisoner cell blocks. I had special
handlers, and they caught me with an outbound note that gave
leads I knew the interrogators could develop through tort u re. The
result would be to implicate my friends in “black activities” (as the
N o rth Vietnamese called them). I had been through those ro p e s
m o re than a dozen times, and I knew I could c o n t a i n m a t e r i a l – –s o
long as they didn’t know I knew it. But this note would open doors
that could lead to more people getting killed in there. We had lost
a few in big purges––I think in tort u re overshoots––and I was getting
t i red of it. It was the fall of 1969, and I had been in this role for
four years and saw nothing left for me to do but check out. I was
solo in the main tort u re room in an isolated part of the prison, the
night before what they told me would be my day to spill my guts.
T h e re was an eerie mood in the prison. Ho Chi Minh had just died,
and his special dirge music was in the air. I was to sit up all night
in traveling irons. My chair was near the only paned glass window
in the prison. I was able to waddle over and break the window
s t e a l t h i l y. I went after my wrist arteries with the big shards. I had
knocked the light out, but the patrol guard happened to find me
passed out in a pool of blood but still breathing. The Vi e t n a m e s e
sounded the alert, got their doctor, and saved me.
Why? It was not until after I was released years later that I
l e a rned that that very week, Sybil had been in Paris demanding
humane treatment for prisoners. She was on world news, a public
f i g u re, and the last thing the North Vietnamese needed was me
dead. There had been a very solemn crowd of senior North Vi e t -
namese officers in that room as I was re v i v e d .
Courage under Fire 20
Prison tort u re, as we had known it in Hanoi, ended for every b od y
that night.
Of course it was months before we could be sure that was so.
All I knew at the time was that in the morning, after my arms had
been dressed and bandaged, the commissar himself brought in a hot
cup of sweet tea, told my surveillance guard to take off my leg iro n s ,
and asked me to sit at the table with him. “Why did you do this,
Sto-dale? You know I sit with the arm y ’s General Staff; they’ve
asked for a full re p o rt this morning.” (It was not unusual for us to
talk like that by that time.) But he never once mentioned the note,
nor did anybody else there a f t e r. T h a t was unprecedented. After a
couple of months in a tiny isolated cell we called Calcutta to let my
a rms heal, they blindfolded me and walked me right into the Las
Vegas cell block. The isolation and special surveillance were over.
I was put solo, of course, in the Mint.
Dave Hatcher knew I was back because I was walked under his
w i n d o w, and though he could not peek out, he could listen and
over the years had attuned his ear to my walking “signature,” my
limping gait. Soon enough, the rusty wire over the sink in the
w a s h room was bent to the north––Dave Hatcher’s signal for “note
in the bottle under the sink for Stockdale.” Like an old fighter pilot,
I checked my six o’clock, scooped the note up fast, and concealed
it in my prison pajama pants, care f u l l y. Back in my cell, after the
g u a rd locked the door, I sat on my toilet bucket––where I could
stealthily jettison the note if the peephole cover moved––and unfolded
Hatcher’s sheet of low-grade paper toweling on which, with
a rat dropping, he had printed, without comment or signature, the
last verse of Ernest Henley’s poem I n v i c t u s:
It matters not how strait the gate,
How charged with punishment the scroll,
I am the master of my fate:
I am the captain of my soul.
