what about my need to socialize. maybe being excluded of a group is something good: you pass to the next chapter of life (step 2) eaisily. maybe this side of the world is better.

Competencia con francisco gallarini

The maximum amount of time I plan is one day. If I don’t accomplish stuff in one day, I feel bad.
Fear to death and nights.

Competition < Collaboration. And my history of competition

The problem with english isn’t that I don’t know vocabulary. Instead, the problem is that I think I think I know about words that I don’t really know. So I end up inventing words.

With the social stuff, I ‘ve been avoiding thinking what I discovered some days ago: the univ decision was taken by a clueless (I’m not saying that now I’m clueful) santi.

Reflections
Maxims
Maximize connections with interesting people. Live with Dylan/Alejo. This makes me extremely happy.
Actively read four hours per day
Be a good person; do what you love.

26/11/17
Excellent day! I was with Dylan the last two days.
The importance of connecting with people is just extremely important. I’m very happy.

The notion of productivity seems flawed.

Year’s lesson:
Taking the importance of connecting with people as an asset, and embracing it.
Never give up on my learning, my connecting with interesting people, and building stuff

24/11/17
Extremely bad day. Can’t do anything since 13hs.
I need to talk with people. I need to spare time with them. I need to connect. And what am I doing? Nothing. No connecting. No nothing.

23/11/17
My gosh. I agree: the problem of excluding myself is a real issue. Yesterday I talked like 5hs with Julia and today I had the Marketing’s presentation, Psychologist, Personal ad, and good conversation with dax and ce. Now, I’m happy and can take good decisions. I’m in calm.

19/11/17
Feelings during a crisis.
This problem is terrible. It is one of my biggest issues. It’s my responsibility to solve it, but I’m not alone.
I feel sad and can’t do anything

18/11/17
Today was an excellent day
I was happy and relaxed
I had great conversations with dax and mom, the nonna, and my cousins. I slept seven hours in the micro and three at home.
To get rid of distractions is very importing

It seems like the best thing is to study a lot

Advice
Biggest problem: not socializing
=> Get to know Rami. Talk with Dylan?, Migue?, Mike, Chona
We aren’t applying what we think about the importance of the connections between people
=> Maximize connection with people. This is as important as work.
Everybody has something to teach us.
=> try to find what everybody has to teach us. (in mom it can be what we’ve written in the essay)
Don’t socializing enough during the day
=> use more (and in a better way) whatsapp

Side-projects
Write essays
Read papers and books
=> Read more. Look for interesting books besides “The Obstacle is the WAy”
School
Startups (joe vs ale) vs university: think & talk with several people.
=> Talk with Pablo, Facu, Mati C, Family?
=> Meet Ale this weekend to improve my intuition. Maybe talk about the topic with him.

Log
An interesting thing happened today: Joe had said me that he wasn’t going to apply for a scholarship, and today (when applications were over) he said me that he asked for a scholarship
I talked about this with Pablo.
Was very tired at 15. Went to play football. Took a shower. Tea. And I was practically recovered. We can go to play football some time before being totally exhausted.
Today I read that Integrity is one key element to look for in people. Integrity + intelligent + energy

Not leave all to the last day in the application process for universities. Do it more spaced, not everything one day, or at least do my best not to get stressed.

Get better at English!

31
Not socialized enough. Let's make this the last day of having less socialization than needed. The base is project with Joe. Then Alejo, Juli G, Jero, and Dylan as friends. Julia. Julia and Emi. Clari, Franco, and Trini. Ro and Delfi. Grandmoms. Facu. Ryan and Migue. Family.

I was all the day with MIT applications. I would like to don't have to do much more stuff like this. It's just so boring! Maybe my approach was bad.

Advice
Write the three fields left and MIT specific for each teacher. Go at 11:00 to ORT to find Caro,Joaco and Daro.

30
Advice
The productivity is directly related to socializing. Let's go
Calm and socialization are the key.
Maybe calm is a subproblem in socialization
Call friends
Hangout with Dylan

Nervous with Julia

Night reflection #29
Advice
Calm is the key (=>Meditate)
Finish writing the MIT essays bad, and start cleaning them up.
Organize stuff per day, per month, per year. Use deadlines.
Do errands
Socialization is the key
Call (Clari | Franco | Facu | Grandmoms)
Everybody has something to teach us. Try to take advantage of this regarding my family
Our productivity is directly related to this. Socialize.

//It isn’t bad per se to socialize with only one person. In fact, today I didn’t have a crisis, so we aren’t that bad. Thing is, take care of this. Again, it is your biggest problem. Maximize depth * quantity

Crisis
Good.
Didn’t socialize a lot, but talk almost 1 hour with Joe. I think that that it’s the reason of the good here.

Problems
TV at night. I should have drown.
Not having interesting topics to talk with mom or dax.

Productivity
Excellent in productivity from 8 - 9 and 20 - 22:30
Bad in productivity from 12 - 15. This was related to being too focused on improving Daro’s section and in the Curt’s problem
Awful in productivity from 15 - 19

Night reflection #28
Advice
Prepare all the MIT’s Daro section.
Socialization is the key
Maybe Joe isn’t the guy to socialize. Recheck when sharing project when him, but until doing it, we should rely on others (=> calling friends | meeting (jero | ale))
Everybody has something to teach us. Find it.
Socializing is worth it. This is our biggest problem by far. Just remember the happiness I had the monday
Organize stuff per day, per month, per year. Use deadlines.
Write all the MIT Essays roughly and bad, and then clean them up.

Call friends, don't be afraid about that.
Try to be more organized and separate things to do per day!!!

Connect with: dylan, Giselle, Joe

After talking with Giselle and Joe I was excellent in energy dylans meeting wasn't productive in socializing

Night reflection #26
Screwed it up with social stuff
People with whom I connected
Migue ?

Advice
Socialize is the key. Connect with people.
That’s the biggest problem by far. Call people, send audios, talk presently with people. Everybody has something to teach us.

Night reflection #25

Have fun in football
Make the most to understand everything in math and rori classes
Errands & Reading while travelling
Finish Mariano’s recommendation letter
Finish Creactivis personal essay
Finish errands & reading
Stanford’s questions
Stanford’s short essays

Accomplished
Jose, HJ, and English: good.
Travelling to giselle: good
Giselle: bad. Too distracted.
Travelling from giselle: great. Very driven. I think it was because of the day’s socializing and Julia’s message
At home: good. Didn’t have ideas, but took determined approach (i.e., not passing to the next task until finishing the one in hand). This approach is very useful!
At dinner: bad. I mean, the situation is bad. Without TV is just good.

People who I connected
Migue (english class)
Joe (José, HJ, lunch [our relationship, Julia])
Dylan (lunch, English)
Giselle: it was interesting when I looked into her eyes. That felt great.
Some whatsapp conversations

It felt great to give the chocolates to Dani and Giselle
Interestingly enough, I didn’t connect with any of my family today.

Advice
Too much whatsapp, too little deep conversations!
It’s important to keep the happiness I have right now. It’s just directly connected to the amount of good quality socializing
So, socialize!
Start earlier with the reflection.
Connect with my family
Check if TV is persisting, if it is, remove it or change it for movies.
Use the school recesses to socialize

Night reflection #24
Have finished common app by Tuesday!
We don't want to be stressed. Work hard to finish everything by Tuesday

Make a methodical approach to the crisis

The motivation beneath our goals matters.
Becoming a better person != getting better at stuff

Was without energy, took several breaks, but were unproductive anyway
Pay attention to the energy I have, don't try to make me work if it is unproductive

Prefer personal coversarion over whatsapp with Joe and in general
Let my hair grow and grow

Night reflection #22
Good meeting today
Meeting people as well as networking are very important
Thought along Joe about univ and whether it is good for us to go to universities or not.
Maybe we shouldn't stress too much in the productivity system, instead we should focus on working on something interesting (not the case for universities)
Good socializing with individuals, have a lot to improve in socializing with groups

Night reflection #21
It seems nonsense to read all the days the same text.
Hadn't good performance on OIA, maybe it was because I didn't train
Stay up late at night
Didn't reflect in the working sessions
Didn't take enough breaks

Morning reflection #21
Stoic
I’m not the friend that I would like to be. For instance, with Ale, I think that I’m taking more from the relationship that what he is taking.
When some friend has a bad behavior with us, remember that we also had bad attitudes.

Takeaways
Eat less and faster
Don’t work after dinner
Take breaks when I feel it (keep a low threshold)
Reflect before and after working
Scheduling

Stoic - Yesterday
When someone is bothering me, I can make a better world by politely letting her know that she is annoying me. Otherwise, I think I would be rude by thinking bad about that person.
Those people are just like me. They probably have no intention in bothering us.

Sleep 8 hours
Be kind
Be myself

Night reflection #18
I changed my opinion about trying to have something with a girl talking with Pablo P and Franco the roommate. This type of talks are amazing.
During the day, there were some talks “boring,” and I was somewhat unhappy. Maybe that happened because of not feeling included in a group. This can be solved if I try something with Clari.

However, there were interesting talks such as the astrobiology, that of Carlos Balseiro, and the informal talks with the ex-balseiros

We aren’t being “productive.” The only “need” of productiveness is for the Stanford deadline, otherwise there isn’t a strict activity to do. This can be an excellent way of having holidays from the university process, and it can be better if we enjoy it with Clari

Morning reflection #17


Night reflection #17
When I remember about the Julia thing, it seems weird.

I couldn’t enjoy social moments when people were talking about what I considered it was useless stuff.

Hey! I’m happy! The nap was amazing. Something to take into account! We can write about it in the essay about productivity. Doing the practical works for the school is so relaxing. It’s pretty easy to know what to do, it is pretty straight-forward. Try to make things straightforward as that.

On school I was only studying for the exams, and I finished very tired. The soft reset was excellent. Maybe the way I’m doing things for school isn’t the best, but there are only a few exams left, so nobody cares about the school. I mean, the long-term doesn’t care because there aren’t a long term.

Hey buddy!
How are you?
Today was a great day. I just got me to hard work through the SAT and TOEFL. I did a writing mock and I corrected it. I read some pages of the Erica Meltzer Reading book. I exercised. I corrected the TOEFL writing. I started to correct the Speaking. I wake up late and I was all the day working. I think that I should have done more with the whole day, but it seems pretty difficult to do more than what I have done.

I’m talking to myself in english! That’s great
I have a stomach ache.



#4/9/2017
Hey, my friend. I just wanna say that we need to change the school. I’m leaving it in three months (incredible!), but it is pretty important to prevent other people from living that type of life. That should change. School should change. I have Marketing as a subject! WTF. Most of the subjects are easier to trick than to study for them. I’m learning almost nothing from school. I’m not saying that people don’t need to go to the school. In fact, is the place to know people when you are young; instead, I’m saying it needs to change.

I’m pretty happy. It can be because I finished the second term. Also, I have the italki class. I’m sleeping well. I’m not meditating. I’m taking baths very ocassionaly. I’m talking with girls very ocassionaly. I’m seldom doing exercise. (things to improve?)

Dear diary, how are you?



Situations that make me unhappy:
Today, at the Todaro class I feel bad because I couldn't be productive. One good method would be to use headphones. A good way of solving those situations is go to the bathroom. In general, if I get stucked in something, is recommendable to leave the place and think “out of the box”

Also at the Tribunales class I felt bad. I felt that I was at a defensive state and sad.

Sometimes I don't know what to do and that makes me feel uncomfortable. If I leave the place or I analyze the situation later, it turns out to be easy what to do, but during the situation I can't think of good things to do, and sometimes I finished doing mundane tasks and unimportant things.

Mas que un log esto sería un algo. no sé que. tenemos que escribir. me parece que es potente, el tema es que en papel no sale mucho, entonces veamos que onda este formato. lindo día hoy, estamos en uruguay por el foro cilac, viajamos en avión, algo que no hacía hace bastante tiempo. Me estoy preocupando demasiado por cosas sin sentido como la plata o lo que me estaría perdiendo, y no quisiera preocuparme tanto por eso, tampoco me tengo que preocupar por estarme preocupando (:p). La vida va bien, pp está up, hay que ver como seguimos con otros paises. a ver, pp es malo o bueno? nadie lo sabe, en arg que este red solidaria medio que molesta pero yo creo que la plataforma que hice más experiencia en el tema es un buen producto, lo malo es que tal vez le estmaos sacando potencia al proyecto grande, el cual mepa que tiene la posta, tenemos que activar para que no pase lo mismo que en GL, voy a tener que hacer alto curso o aprender rápido meteor en estos días. Estas dos semanitas vienen cargadas, pero interesantes, me perdí / pierdo algunos cumpleaños, medio molesto por un lado, pero es a cambio de una linda experiencia. SmarTACC no le deberíamos dar bola, algo minimo me pa. Sobre este documento, no es para leerlo casi que nunca, ni menos editarlo, es solo para pasarlo de la cabeza en limpio, ac+a estamos esto esta genial. creo que som esta bajando. pero no hay que estar pendiente de eso. sobre el plan, que es de las cosas más importantes, tiene la posta, hay que ponerselo a pensar muy bien, definir bien varias cosas y va a salir re copado. Estos docs son  lo más. Hay que continuar un rato con estos, probar con algun formato tipo md, y ver que onda

2/12/17
Today I was neither good or bad. When I started things, fastly I become boring at it. I was unhappy

2/18/17
I feel good and with calm. There was no crisis this last week. I recognize the fear of losing time, and now I’m doing whatever I please. I played some games and I felt weird.

Yesterday with Joel we talked about Santi. Specifically about being afraid to die.

3/24/17 Crisis
Today I enter in a sort of crisis. I begin the day trying to install lubuntu, and I meet with some bugs and difficulties. When I started to think what things I can do, I found boring things and I oversee things that applied for the moment (e.g. khanacademy).

I think that a good solution to this problem is that whenever I feel something like this coming, the more useful (and productive) thing is to take a bath, go out to walk, sleep or meditate.

3/24/17 Machine Learning
I think that the best thing that someone can do in his life is learn machine learning. Is the future.
I think that is like the Paul Graham line, that anybody says that the programming language that one knows is the best, but the programmers that know lisp are the uniques that say this confident. With ML I think that applies the same, it’s like doing any other thing makes no sense.

Sooner or later, AI will do all things that an human can right now do.

Also, I think that helps a lot in giving a solution to my most big fear, the fear to die.

Last, I like it a lot, is like programming with some nature and some maths.

A good recipe to know if you are interested in a topic is think if you can pass a whole week reading from your phone some paper about the topic.

Mind
I think that the mind needs to be almost completely free. It’s bad for us and also counter-productive to try to change thoughts. It’s like trying to change a branch instead of the whole tree. Wonder about what your mind needs.

I tried to change my thoughts about girls a lot. But I think that that wasn’t the way to do the things, now I’m doing what my mind says, and going to the root of the thoughts. In the case of the girls, is the medium-term plan to girls.

Medium-term plan to girls
The plan is first have good friends.

1/31/17 Some sort of crisis
I’m here. I have some sort of crisis, but is less painful and more often. Is like it occurs every afternoon. I think that maybe increasing the Santi’s PBI is the solution. Maybe reducing anxiety. I wrote solution right there, but seems to be no solution in the near term. And I wanted to remove the “solution” word. It’s like I wanna hide that I keep thinking that there will be a simple solution. No, the solution isn’t that there are no solutions. For one, I do not increase the PBI, so I will test it, I know that if it gives no solution in the near term, maybe it will be good anyway, but I think that some information will be given. Furthermore, it seems to be a good option.

I think it’s kinda difficult to know where I’m experiencing this crisis. When I realize that I’m in this crisis, is too late, and in general I was experiencing the crisis for few hours before.

So now, test new things. I’m going to the pain, but the crisis continues. Increasing PBI right now.

2/8/17 Anxiety
Today I was with some calm, and before going to swim, I saw a star wars: clone wars episode. After I finish that episode, I sense a lot of anxiety in me.

4/3/17
I'm writing this the day after 4/3/17, that is, before analyzing the day.

I started the day practicing for the SAT, and, after the lunch, I started to write a new version of Jocasta. I had been thinking about a new version of the system for days, it was plausible sounding, and I had been taking it with calm and without anxiety.

Yesterday, I developed a little more the concept and I started to write the

4/6/17 english + pesaj + AI + college
It has changed a lot from the last log.

College
After a talk with Mati and Joe, and various thoughts, I decided that I’m going to spend a lot of time in the college application process. I’m not decided whether I’m going to study in the US or not yet, but I’m more for the US University side that before.

English
As I choose to do the college application process, I’m improving my English.
Pronunciation
I’m using Elsa Speak app. It’s excellent.
Writing
I’m writing docs, answers in quora, and posts in medium.
Both
Talking with someone (e.g. Ale B.)

Pesaj
Within the next 13 days, and I am going to go to the school only two days. There are a lot of time to practice English, do things with girls and last, but obviously not least, learn AI

Girls
Mati C. said “Consiganse una novia.” Besides Mati C. said that I also want to get a girlfriend or at first, approach to girls.

I have differents ways to approach girls: (a) ORT, (b) English course, (c) pascua diferente, (d) dance with Mike. There are many opportunities, so if I take advantage of they and I go with a mentality of getting rejected, I think I could get good results.

Impossible things
Historically, girls and English were the two topics that I was bad at, and whatever I did, they weren’t going to change. Recently, the university decision entered in this category of impossible things.

For being in this category, most of the solutions get rejected at first glance, and I get afraid of not get the result that I want.

Now I’m trying to keep aside this feeling and improve my English, relationship with girls and my mentality in the face of the decision. I know that this will take a lot of time, and I know that I need to be very patient. So, calm! Isn’t impossible, it’s only difficult.

AGI
Ruben allowed us to make AI research as the final project in ORT. That is awesome! We are following the “Handbook of neuroevolution through erlang” as one approach, and maybe we will take another approach more.

Pebble
I bought Nico Bilinkis’ Pebble for $1200. I think the only two uses are: copying in tests and recording the time that I sleep.

4/11/17
At the morning, I watched a video of Startup School. I think that this is a good idea to do every day.
Then, I forgot about making the daily meditation. Instead, I started to do some research about the different camps. Today I decided that I’m going to apply to MILSET with Estefi and her friends.

At the noon, I went out with Julia to Deli, in La Horqueta. It was fine, I think that the last time had been better, but also it had been longer (almost twice longer). Today, I tried to improve my eye contact, I think that I’m becoming better, but I’m far from perfect. Also, I stuttered sometimes at talking. I think that I said some jokes and also that’s an improvement.

When I was going to home, my phone was without battery, and I hadn’t my kindle. I was relaxed, I remembered what Simon Sinek said at the Millenials video and I felt identified.

When I arrived home, I wrote some things about my long term plan. Then, I went to the park to play football and when I got back I continue doing some exercise

4/21/17
I’m getting troubles in school because I can’t do anything. I don’t know if it is the motivation, or the social fear of doing hard work, but I end up doing almost nothing.

I think that the

4/28/17 happy day
Today i get awake very happy. I slept for 8:30 hours and I don't take too much time to sleep. Yesterday I thought about the crisis and that the problem is that I was doing fake work instead of hard work.

6/8/17
Today I feel good. We talked about the startupschool credits with Joe. Right now, I think that the best thing to do is to give the credits to Diamond. Also, today I went to a talk in ORT Yatay about robotics. When I was returning, I talked all the trip with Chona, Sponja and Vale. I was happy when talking to them.

Girls
I’m talking with a lot of girls via whatsapp, and I feel proud and happy for that.

We just revalidated the importance of socializing. Yesterday, I was unproductive. Today, I had a great meeting with the boys and a good conversation with Migue, and my evening was amazing. This wasn’t all, of course. I have been somewhat disciplined today, so that can influence.

Hey! I’m happy! The nap was amazing. Something to take into account! We can write about it in the essay about productivity. Doing the practical works for the school is so relaxing. It’s pretty easy to know what to do, it is pretty straight-forward. Try to make things straightforward as that.

On school I was only studying for the exams, and I finished very tired. The soft reset was excellent. Maybe the way I’m doing things for school isn’t the best, but there are only a few exams left, so nobody cares about the school. I mean, the long-term doesn’t care because there aren’t a long term.

#10/9
Hey buddy!
How are you?
Today was a great day. I just got me to hard work through the SAT and TOEFL. I did a writing mock and I corrected it. I read some pages of the Erica Meltzer Reading book. I exercised. I corrected the TOEFL writing. I started to correct the Speaking. I wake up late and I was all the day working. I think that I should have done more with the whole day, but it seems pretty difficult to do more than what I have done.

I’m talking to myself in english! That’s great
I have a stomach ache.



#4/9/2017
Hey, my friend. I just wanna say that we need to change the school. I’m leaving it in three months (incredible!), but it is pretty important to prevent other people from living that type of life. That should change. School should change. I have Marketing as a subject! WTF. Most of the subjects are easier to trick than to study for them. I’m learning almost nothing from school. I’m not saying that people don’t need to go to the school. In fact, is the place to know people when you are young; instead, I’m saying it needs to change.

I’m pretty happy. It can be because I finished the second term. Also, I have the italki class. I’m sleeping well. I’m not meditating. I’m taking baths very ocassionaly. I’m talking with girls very ocassionaly. I’m seldom doing exercise. (things to improve?)

Dear diary, how are you?



Situations that make me unhappy:
Today, at the Todaro class I feel bad because I couldn't be productive. One good method would be to use headphones. A good way of solving those situations is go to the bathroom. In general, if I get stucked in something, is recommendable to leave the place and think “out of the box”

Also at the Tribunales class I felt bad. I felt that I was at a defensive state and sad.

Sometimes I don't know what to do and that makes me feel uncomfortable. If I leave the place or I analyze the situation later, it turns out to be easy what to do, but during the situation I can't think of good things to do, and sometimes I finished doing mundane tasks and unimportant things.

La vida va bien, pp está up, hay que ver como seguimos con otros paises. a ver, pp es malo o bueno? nadie lo sabe, en arg que este red solidaria medio que molesta pero yo creo que la plataforma que hice más experiencia en el tema es un buen producto, lo malo es que tal vez le estmaos sacando potencia al proyecto grande, el cual mepa que tiene la posta, tenemos que activar para que no pase lo mismo que en GL, voy a tener que hacer alto curso o aprender rápido meteor en estos días. Estas dos semanitas vienen cargadas, pero interesantes, me perdí / pierdo algunos cumpleaños, medio molesto por un lado, pero es a cambio de una linda experiencia. SmarTACC no le deberíamos dar bola, algo minimo me pa. Sobre este documento, no es para leerlo casi que nunca, ni menos editarlo, es solo para pasarlo de la cabeza en limpio, ac+a estamos esto esta genial. creo que som esta bajando. pero no hay que estar pendiente de eso. sobre el plan, que es de las cosas más importantes, tiene la posta, hay que ponerselo a pensar muy bien, definir bien varias cosas y va a salir re copado. Estos docs son  lo más. Hay que continuar un rato con estos, probar con algun formato tipo md, y ver que onda

2/12/17
Today I was neither good or bad. When I started things, fastly I become boring at it. I was unhappy

2/18/17
I feel good and with calm. There was no crisis this last week. I recognize the fear of losing time, and now I’m doing whatever I please. I played some games and I felt weird.

Yesterday with Joel we talked about Santi. Specifically about being afraid to die.

I don’t want anything with girls

3/24/17 Crisis
Today I enter in a sort of crisis. I begin the day trying to install lubuntu, and I meet with some bugs and difficulties. When I started to think what things I can do, I found boring things and I oversee things that applied for the moment (e.g. khanacademy).

I think that a good solution to this problem is that whenever I feel something like this coming, the more useful (and productive) thing is to take a bath, go out to walk, sleep or meditate.

3/24/17 Machine Learning
I think that the best thing that someone can do in his life is learn machine learning. Is the future.
I think that is like the Paul Graham line, that anybody says that the programming language that one knows is the best, but the programmers that know lisp are the uniques that say this confident. With ML I think that applies the same, it’s like doing any other thing makes no sense.

Sooner or later, AI will do all things that an human can right now do.

Also, I think that helps a lot in giving a solution to my most big fear, the fear to die.

Last, I like it a lot, is like programming with some nature and some maths.

A good recipe to know if you are interested in a topic is think if you can pass a whole week reading from your phone some paper about the topic.

Mind
I think that the mind needs to be almost completely free. It’s bad for us and also counter-productive to try to change thoughts. It’s like trying to change a branch instead of the whole tree. Wonder about what your mind needs.

I tried to change my thoughts about girls a lot. But I think that that wasn’t the way to do the things, now I’m doing what my mind says, and going to the root of the thoughts. In the case of the girls, is the medium-term plan to girls.

Medium-term plan to girls
The plan is first have good friends.

1/31/17 Some sort of crisis
I’m here. I have some sort of crisis, but is less painful and more often. Is like it occurs every afternoon. I think that maybe increasing the Santi’s PBI is the solution. Maybe reducing anxiety. I wrote solution right there, but seems to be no solution in the near term. And I wanted to remove the “solution” word. It’s like I wanna hide that I keep thinking that there will be a simple solution. No, the solution isn’t that there are no solutions. For one, I do not increase the PBI, so I will test it, I know that if it gives no solution in the near term, maybe it will be good anyway, but I think that some information will be given. Furthermore, it seems to be a good option.

I think it’s kinda difficult to know where I’m experiencing this crisis. When I realize that I’m in this crisis, is too late, and in general I was experiencing the crisis for few hours before.

So now, test new things. I’m going to the pain, but the crisis continues. Increasing PBI right now.

2/8/17 Anxiety
Today I was with some calm, and before going to swim, I saw a star wars: clone wars episode. After I finish that episode, I sense a lot of anxiety in me.

4/3/17
I'm writing this the day after 4/3/17, that is, before analyzing the day.

I started the day practicing for the SAT, and, after the lunch, I started to write a new version of Jocasta. I had been thinking about a new version of the system for days, it was plausible sounding, and I had been taking it with calm and without anxiety.

Yesterday, I developed a little more the concept and I started to write the

4/6/17 english + pesaj + AI + college
It has changed a lot from the last log.

College
After a talk with Mati and Joe, and various thoughts, I decided that I’m going to spend a lot of time in the college application process. I’m not decided whether I’m going to study in the US or not yet, but I’m more for the US University side that before.

English
As I choose to do the college application process, I’m improving my English.
Pronunciation
I’m using Elsa Speak app. It’s excellent.
Writing
I’m writing docs, answers in quora, and posts in medium.
Both
Talking with someone (e.g. Ale B.)

Pesaj
Within the next 13 days, and I am going to go to the school only two days. There are a lot of time to practice English, do things with girls and last, but obviously not least, learn AI

Girls
Mati C. said “Consiganse una novia.” Besides Mati C. said that I also want to get a girlfriend or at first, approach to girls.

I have differents ways to approach girls: (a) ORT, (b) English course, (c) pascua diferente, (d) dance with Mike. There are many opportunities, so if I take advantage of they and I go with a mentality of getting rejected, I think I could get good results.

Impossible things
Historically, girls and English were the two topics that I was bad at, and whatever I did, they weren’t going to change. Recently, the university decision entered in this category of impossible things.

For being in this category, most of the solutions get rejected at first glance, and I get afraid of not get the result that I want.

Now I’m trying to keep aside this feeling and improve my English, relationship with girls and my mentality in the face of the decision. I know that this will take a lot of time, and I know that I need to be very patient. So, calm! Isn’t impossible, it’s only difficult.

AGI
Ruben allowed us to make AI research as the final project in ORT. That is awesome! We are following the “Handbook of neuroevolution through erlang” as one approach, and maybe we will take another approach more.

Pebble
I bought Nico Bilinkis’ Pebble for $1200. I think the only two uses are: copying in tests and recording the time that I sleep.

4/11/17
At the morning, I watched a video of Startup School. I think that this is a good idea to do every day.
Then, I forgot about making the daily meditation. Instead, I started to do some research about the different camps. Today I decided that I’m going to apply to MILSET with Estefi and her friends.

At the noon, I went out with Julia to Deli, in La Horqueta. It was fine, I think that the last time had been better, but also it had been longer (almost twice longer). Today, I tried to improve my eye contact, I think that I’m becoming better, but I’m far from perfect. Also, I stuttered sometimes at talking. I think that I said some jokes and also that’s an improvement.

When I was going to home, my phone was without battery, and I hadn’t my kindle. I was relaxed, I remembered what Simon Sinek said at the Millenials video and I felt identified.

When I arrived home, I wrote some things about my long term plan. Then, I went to the park to play football and when I got back I continue doing some exercise

4/21/17
I’m getting troubles in school because I can’t do anything. I don’t know if it is the motivation, or the social fear of doing hard work, but I end up doing almost nothing.

I think that the

4/28/17 happy day
Today i get awake very happy. I slept for 8:30 hours and I don't take too much time to sleep. Yesterday I thought about the crisis and that the problem is that I was doing fake work instead of hard work.

6/8/17
Today I feel good. We talked about the startupschool credits with Joe. Right now, I think that the best thing to do is to give the credits to Diamond. Also, today I went to a talk in ORT Yatay about robotics. When I was returning, I talked all the trip with Chona, Sponja and Vale. I was happy when talking to them.

Girls
I’m talking with a lot of girls via whatsapp, and I feel proud and happy for that.

Crisis
Yoda List: be productive; be sociable; remain in calm; sleep, eat, and exercise well

Lack of confidence?
Demoralizing results

Generally, unproductiveness happens because of the following reasons
bad procrastination (fulfilling todo lists).
this happens when laziness wins. If I have two tasks, choose the harder
ask myself “is this the most important thing you could be doing?”
bad environments (school, library, some Diamond meetings)
not having something defined to work on
not having interesting and fulfilling problems to work on
not having small chunks of the problem to work on
not planning
being disorganized

Generally, not being sociable happens because of these reasons
isolating myself to work
focusing only on work
staying with the Diamond Team as my only friends
not getting out my comfort zone
assuming that I need the same amount of socialization than others
not checking whatsapp often

Generally, not sleeping well happens because
school schedule
staying up late working
being waken up by Javi
Trying to get more work done in the short term

Not being in calm => not meditating
Not exercising well => not having a daily routine
Not eating well => family, not paying attention to it, not giving effort,

When I don’t fulfill the Yoda List, I become less happy

The less happy I’m, the less I fulfill the Yoda List
short-term: being happier means having more energy and being more disciplined
long-term: I make habits of not being productive nor sociable

Negative feedback loop! In this way, I finish my days very unhappy.

There are two ways to revert the negative feedback loop: sleeping or energizing myself

Sleeping: As Fidel Nadal says “Que el sol saldrá de nuevo nadie lo puede evitar.” When we go to sleep we reset us. It can be a nap or a full session of sleeping.

Energizing myself can be done in several ways. Today I energized myself by going to play football and then taking a shower with motivating music. It took 45 minutes and was worth it.

After we revert the loop, we need to start doing activities and begin the positive feedback loop.

Crisis
As far as I know, the crisis are strongly related to being unhappy and not having a visible positive outcome (i.e. thinking that I will stay in crisis because historically that happened).

As in the past I didn’t manage well the situation, my intuition told me that it was very difficult to solve the problem, but, when I saw the crisis consciously, I realized that there were no difficult problems there.

So what’s the problem?
Firstly, I’m unhappy because I feel lonely. Secondly, I’m unhappy because I feel unproductive.
There are other factors that influence my happiness: sleep, meals, meditation, exercise, gratitude and recreation. But those are secondary.

Loneliness
Stay in home for a complete summer is insane. Just check our winter holidays or when our parents left home and I stayed at home. We just can’t carry a life without socializing.

I don’t know how much time we need to dedicate daily to social stuff, but I’m pretty sure is more than two hours.

Even though is better to have physical conversations, some conversations via whatsapp can have some effect of socializing.

It’s not about being with people. Instead, it is about how I feel. Specifically, how much included in a group I feel.

Try to greet (as Pablo taught me) all the people at ORT.
Try to feel compassion and care for others.
Try to have every meal with interesting people and talk with them.
Try to talk with people during the breaks.
Try to have every day a social activity.
Try to dedicate more time to the big family: read family groups, talk with grandmothers, talk with Facu
Try to do things with interesting people (axel fridman, rami)
Try to have mentors guiding me in the process (e.g. Mati C, Pablo P, Oliver Italki)

Girls
Try not to use Instagram

Record
After autoexcluding me for one hour to be productive for the TOEFL, I feel pretty bad.

Tiredness
I never got a crisis during the morning!!!
I used to suppose that time is fungible and that I should be productive all the day.
Maybe if I try to be productive all the day I fail during the afternoon, and I become unhappy.
Also, if I sleep less than 8 Pebble hours, in a medium term, I will feel bad and tired during the day.

Try to sleep more than 8 Pebble hours
Try to keep record of the slept hours (turning on Bluetooth at night)
Try to eat lighter and faster at night
Try to eat heavier in the tea
Try to do nothing after eating dinner

Can’t concentrate
Is there any way to focus with noise and permanent distractions? I don’t think so
I thought two ways to avoid them
Using headphones
Going to the library
Another options is to don’t focus at all
Paying attention to the class
Doing some very low demanding task as english doc, homework or courseworks (TPs)

For our health, we only can wear headphones one hour per day. Also, using headphones in the classes makes a pretty bad impression on the teachers.

Not focusing doesn’t work either, as we want to get hard work done.

Therefore, even though we can wear headphones and not to focus once or twice, the best thing seems to be going to the library often.

Try to go to the library often.
Try to minimize the work done outside a subject. e.g. Study math in the math class.

Logs
I feel pretty bad after not being able to focus when there was a movie

Unproductivity
We do know that productivity is an important factor in my happiness. I’m pretty sure that if I weren’t alone at all but I were unproductive, I would feel unhappy.

I’m not sure whether I’m unproductive because of the unhappiness. For one, we know that if I’m unhappy I will be unproductive, but I don’t know if I’m being unproductive because of the unhappiness.

Try to have always a plan and have clear what to do.
Try to never do useless things, for example: todolist, organization, school classes and movies, news and Facebook in other’s phones. If I’m going to do some of those things, I want you to be conscious by writing a small record.
Try to always work hard. Do that thing that seems like the correct but requires a lot of effort.
“Even Einstein probably had moments when he wanted to have a cup of coffee, but told himself he ought to finish what he was working on first.”

Don’t knowing what to do?
Remove the TV (piecita). Take a break. Make a good plan.

Should I do activities in fixed schedules?
Why not? I mean, we can change that at every moment and it can benefit us to have clear what to do.

Action justification
If I’m doing nothing, I will generate some excuses to demonstrate that it’s right to do nothing.
A very common excuse I create is the “I don’t have a plan”. It’s impossible to know how to make the plan if I don’t start practicing.

This is a very difficult thing to overcome. I suffered when I’m trying to be doing something and I do nothing. This can happens because I don’t have a plan, or because I’m tired and I don’t recognize it.

When we don’t know what to do, we just block ourselves. Nothing to do comes to our mind. Try to avoid this. If we are thinking too much about what to do, we react bad. We can just start with whatsapp, then something a bit more difficult and effortful and so on.

Try to divide big things into parts.
Try to just to work: without thinking, open Khan Academy.
Try to get out and take a break If I don’t know what to do.

Other factors
Try to never be too much hungry nor full. Try to eat a lot of fruits and vegetables.
Try to meditate 15 minutes per day.
Try to exercise for 45 minutes per day.
Try to practice gratitude for 15 minutes per day.
Try to have good breaks.
Try to do music meditation (e.g. listening Savoretti) once a day.

#Negative records
##2/8/17
I’m very very sad
###Univ
Lu Parrondo said that the TOEFL was easy (that demoralized me)
I don’t have a plan for the speaking section of the TOEFL

###Social
I excluded myself to work on the TOEFL
I excluded myself to go to swimming
I’m not talking with girls

##7/8/17
I can't do things good. I struggled often in the italki class. In the morning I laugh a lot, and I wasn't productive at all.
I'm sleeping bad, and the retiro made the things worse.
I think that the problem is that I'm tired, so I'm going to sleep

##20/10/17
Was unhappy because of 1470/1600 in the SAT. Went to TEDxrdelap, unhappy also.
Tried lots of breaks Guitar + Drawing with music + Football, returned a little better, started to read the obstacle is the way and feel much better and with a more defined way/ride

#Positive records
##9/8/17
I think that thanks to the 8hs of sleeping and some ideas on how to solve the moments when I feel bad, I’m improving.
I don’t feel perfect, because I can’t work hard yet.
I’m often thinking that I had to plan, but I think that’s an excuse to avoid hard work.

###Prohibiting things
I feel very anxious for the things like opening whatsapp or inbox. Maybe it is because I’m prohibiting myself those things. Try to avoid prohibitng stuff.

###TOEFL
I feel that studying for the TOEFL is a nightmare. I’m pretty sad with the TOEFL situation, and whenever I think about it, my happiness decreases. Historically, I couldn’t make too much progress on it, and the date always was near.
We need to be methodically here. Concentrate in our goals.
First, we want to be accountable. Even if the results are pretty bad, we should try to recognize them. So, we are searching for a system where we have the possibility of knowing our score.
Secondly, we want to the greatest improvement in the least amout of time. We can use our intution here, but the best way, I think, is to be accountable. Then, we should try to test lots of methods and resources.
Try to, daily, make these things: SAT Essay, TOEFL Writing (One of the two), TOEFL Speaking. Maybe is too much, in that case we can try to do only one essay and one speaking.

###Don’t plan or do plan?
There is a lot of information right on the internet. The problem is when that information is overwhelming and I don’t go to study because I keep reading, for example, blog posts.
For one, I think is very important to try to look resources for something specific. For instance, search about how to improve the score on the SAT essay, or better, how to improve the score in the analysis section of the SAT Essay.
Also, I think it’s great to, every day, have, a little amount of time to plan.

##13/8/17
I feel good, nor excellent nor bad.
Brain and Univ: I am studying hard for the SAT and also working hard for Diamond Brain.
Girls: I’m thinking and researching about girls. I’m going to the gym four times per week. I’m having conversations about girls with Mike and Migue (=D). I have been thinking quite a lot about the OMA metropolitan and the things I can do there related to girls.
Sleeping: Of the last six days, three I slept 9 hours and three I slept 8 hours
Family: A little bit more than the normal relationship.
I didn’t feel lonely since two weeks ago.
Nico Szerman, I think, makes me unhappy.

###TOEFL
Right now, I’m not practicing for the TOEFL. Maybe the unhappiness come when I start to study for the TOEFL. If that’s the case, don’t worry. We can make a plan to confront the TOEFL.

##14/8/17
Hey folks!!
I thought I was sick, and maybe I am, but I’m happy and productive.
I went to the gym after ORT.
###TOEFL
I’m studying for the TOEFL and I’m happy!!!
The italki class and the notefull videos (with the 26 guaranteed) contributed to my happiness.
I think I have a bright future in the TOEFL, so I’m pretty happy. Also, today I dedicated time to do things related to the TOEFL and I pushed myself to do more.
###School
At school I was destroyed, a mix between unhappiness and impotency of
###Reflections
I’m doing morning and night reflections, and they seems good.
###Social
Today I talked with Iara in the 15. I feel great after talking to her.
###Night
I don’t know what to do.

25/8
Im not acostumbrado to don't knowing what to do. I didn't sleep well on the last week, and I'm very unhappy because I cant do any productive thing
Feel super pretty bad after sleeping bad and feeling socially excluded


When we sleep bad or we don't eat, we have a limited version of us living our life

As mom and the whole family gave me a lot of attention, I feel bad if I don’t have it. I need a lot of attention, I need other people to care about me.

I screwed it up with social stuff yesterday

when focused on one thing and not getting results, just do anything but continue focusing on that specific thing. The relief helps to think better even about that thing



Health
I took cold a sunday. The monday and thursday I had a small headache. The wednesday I woke up with lots of mucus.

The Saturday 9/9 I had the lucre’s and ceci’s birthday and I met with the diamond team. After that, the 10/9 I didn't socialize but I were pretty productive. Other factors can be influencing me


Me pongo mal por boludeces (clari's message & modifying some letters on the oli’s session)

I think I'm very tired. Today I had an English and a marketing exam, and also I had an argument with Seba. It's pretty difficult for me to recognize I was tired. I tried listening to music on the bus and playing the guitar while seeing the fish, but I'm still tired. I will sleep for 25 minutes 0 minutes. … It seems like the nap worked really good! Just 20 minutes. Right now I’m eating some vanillas and a yogurt. After that, I had the tea with mom. And, after that I had an Italki session, Oli gave me lots of tips to improve my english. Yeah!!! The nap worked like god! I’m very energized!


When unhappy -> Sleep (or relax), socialize, just work

When I think the day’s to do things, I’m dominated by don’t loss time, and not by do whatever I want.

Productive:

Time loss fear generates
Be sad when I can’t be “productive”
Be in the comfort zone, because I do the things that sure don’t make me loss time
Be afraid of having nothing to do
When that happens, I go into crisis
Be afraid of not progressing
Be afraid that the day passed and I did few things

I say a year ago: If I don’t discover the immortality, I wanna die on the try

I’m afraid of don’t be doing all what I can, of don’t be doing the best

I'm in a crisis? => do things
Irrationalities explained
When I'm at dinner, I'm not happy with any of the two alternatives
I think how can I improve other's life if I were them
I say that my life has little action, and I want that weird and sometimes bad things happen
Tener ansias de que otros lleguen
Did jocasta
Struggle to do or think long term stuff
Uno es muy estricto cuando no confía en el proceso a largo plazo
No tengo tanta confianza en mi (me cuesta ver a largo plazo, digo que las cosas que hace la familia son bs)
Hacer multitasking es de impaciente

Temer a no progresar
Tengo miedo que joe o nico digan que no

I do things
Some stuff pass the “i filter”
Some other no
I become more irrational
I feel unhappy
I do more of 2

r=yes, i=yes then
r=no, i=yes
r=yes, i=no

r=yes, i=yes
i’m happy, the problem isn’t active
This activities become over fast in the summer
r=no, i=yes
depending on the moment and on my rationality I do things like this
That this action is irrational takes a lot of time and analysis
r=yes, i=no
I feel that I do nothing and I become unhappy
this make me need to do activities that pass the irrational filter
r=no, i=no
When I’m really bad and I have a very irrational behaviour
Just before I know that I’m in a crisis

Crisis hypothesis
When I have no more observable i=yes activities, then I enter in a crisis. The lower is the I value, the deeper I’m in a crisis.
If I do a lot of i=yes rationally I feel unhappy (we need to validate this)

Desirable behaviour
Whether the irrational filter either give us yes or no, we don’t need to pay attention to it.

Socializing
Well, I think that maybe I know why I have the crisis.
Hyphotesis: it’s because of not connecting with people, that happens because I don’t talk to people or I talk wrong with the people.
Lemme explain:

Stay at home the whole day, or even for weeks without talking to anybody.
Going to school or to sport club but just don’t talking to anybody,
Talking to the people but just in meaningless talks
Feeling excluded, for example when I was in ort and I didn’t was in Diamond. Take the case when Migue, Joe, Ryan and Dylan were festejando.
Feeling that I’m a bad person, for example with the cats
Feeling that I’m a bad person or that I’m losing my friends, for example with the joe thing,
cilac, everything can be explained with this
I feel happy when using wpp
clara thing in corea
Happy during and after caix

well, maybe it isn’t about (or only about) fake work and hard work, maybe that is rational. This seems like a big deal.

Read if I’m in a crisis
The crisis can be related to doing fake work or not socializing.
If I feel that I’m doing fake work, assure that I don’t have any todo list and also that I’m not giving any importance to the order. Read this: http://www.paulgraham.com/procrastination.html http://www.paulgraham.com/selfindulgence.html
http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/doitnow
I think the way to "solve" the problem of procrastination is to let delight pull you instead of making a to-do list push you.
What's the best thing you could be working on, and why aren't you?
If I feel that I’ll never get a girlfriend, I’m not socializing and that I’m getting nowhere, assure that the I have a plan and that it is reliable and realistic. Also, watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBIao6nI58o&t=14s http://www.paulgraham.com/procrastination.html
Doing real work and socializing with girls are both difficult, so it’s known that I need to put a lot of effort to improve my situation. It’s only with real effort that I’ll succeded
If these two are okay, maybe the crisis can be related to: general socializing, meditation, eat, exercise or sleep.

All I know about the crisis and next steps

Social crisis


Productivity crisis


We are never going to do big leaps when learning. The things we truly know seem like obvious because they are in our intuition. I think that we never can do overnight things, regarding learning.

This include sick days and bad days
I think that listen Cumbia isn't a good option to recover from the bad days
Sleep, shower, exercise, cumbia?
Don’t make any plan
Be superb pragmatic, just do things
Don’t even think whether or not plan, just do things.
When angry: exercise, shower, sleep, boring tasks

Crisis: know that I'm not alone. Family and friends are for this.

One solution is to do hard work without cuestionarse, is really a solution?


I’m tired (or ill), I don’t want to do things. Therefore, I try to find a rational argument of why I’m not doing things, so I enter in a crisis because I don’t find a reason.

Other case, I don’t do things. Therefore, I say I’m tired. As it is the starting point is the difficult one, I can trick this stuff with music or some other stimulating. We are consicus of the secondary effects of the stimulating, but it is temporary, only for the starting. We need a big shoot of energy to start doing. Exercise, a shower, motivational video, whatever it is. But, take care of this, when we have enough energy to start and we aren’t starting the problem can be other. I think that isn’t good to take these shoots of energy during good days.

It seems that the energy shoot is misdirected.

Some things I think are related to achieving unhappiness or sadness in my life.

Not having the possibility of doing things.
Todaro’s class with movie
Ruben prohibition of cellphone usage when listening Final Project presentations
having the TV on when eating at dinner.
Doing useless things.
Not being sure if I should study for the TOEFL or the SAT.
Completing a todolist
organizing my things
paying attention to something unimportant as the Dani Vena’s classes
Don’t doing social things
Feeling sad when Joe sent me the long messagei
Feeling sad at the end of the summer holidays
Feeling super great when opening the confirmation box
Feeling super great when Julia sent me a message
Feeling super great when Guada told me that she was going to go to the meeting with Cata
The day after I laugh a lot I feel super great

In home after being in the morning and lunch in ORT. Can’t produce. All things seem daunting. Without creativity nor inspiration to work. Going to try to see a video about how to kiss, exercise, take a bath. Couldn’t really work from 16:30 to 19:30, where I got inspired, but it wasn’t after taking a break. It was after being at the front of the computer for twenty minutes

Couldn’t work until 20hs. Was tired almost all the day until 20. Slept 7:15

Didn’t return refreshed about playing the guitar for 20 minutes (I was learning new stuff in those 20 minutes)


Problems with solution
Are you unhappy?
There must be a problem generating this unhappiness. Look inside me, recollect data, meditate, go for a walk, take a bath and sleep. Try to keep hoping I will find the problem and its solution. The search of the problem may take weeks.

Historically, the crisis were a hard problem to solve (as girls and english were), when I try to solve them, I feel bad and with impotency.
Try to think consciously whether the problem is real. If the problem exists, try to make a plan.

Avoiding anger?
Try not to avoid anger. Feel the real. If we avoid it, we are never going to fix the problem. Just try to calm down and think objectively about the problem.

Having trouble with the cats when leaving and entering home.
Feed them the first time I leave home.

Have breakfast in the kitchen? Have breakfast in the piecita? Have breakfast in the living room?
Have always breakfast in the living room, unless dax didn’t smoke and someone from my family is having breakfast in the kitchen.

Reading messages and not answering them.
Try to do my best to avoid reading the messages hiding some parts of the screen.

Being angry with dax.
Try to minimize the talkings with Dax at the nights and maximize the talkings in the mornings and evenings.

Bad things happening at night.
Try to go to the bedroom to read just after finish the dinner.

Feeling mega bad at night when the TV was on.
See series or movies at dinner.

I'm worried because I'm going to arrive late.
Make a rational estimation and subtract 10 minutes.

Don't know whether to work or talk with dax when traveling in the morning.
This is because I can't come up with a good topic to talk with dax. But

I'm very tired, and I don't have an according activity to do

I have anxiety in many situations in the past, for example, updating the oneplus one to marshmallow. A good opportunity to get out of the anxiety is to meditate or relax when I notice for the first time. Maybe change the activity, or do, but with a lot of calm. Is difficult because the anxiety will say me that that activity is really good, and we don’t need to think about it, but in a lot of cases that is false.

Diamond/Youtube as main activities in the pc
Situation: When I turn on the pc, the default activity is programming, and more specifically Diamond. Also we use a lot YouTube. The pc has others very good uses and we use only two or three a lot. We are doing the default things that more or less work.

Cause: Be afraid to loss time, being unstoppable and unconscious about what I am doing.

Improvement: Always do things before thinking about it. Don’t get carried away. For example, watch a video on YouTube because I decide actively and not because it appeared in the suggestions.

Get frustrated quickly when programming
Situation: Doing programming stuff like holocron.py, installing docker or difficult things in Diamond, I get frustrated very quickly. In PP, Smartacc, TPB and mom’s works times there were no programming obstacles, all was easy and straightforward

Improvement: We need to recognize that now the things are more difficult. We need to use other techniques and dedicate time to learn

Using the PC as main activity
Improvement: The default activity must be think and from there I can be sure that what I’m doing is good.

Improvement 2: Have the smartphone at hand decreases the pc activity,

Embrace your situation
Embrace your situation. I saw me trying to be someone that I’m not. Trying to avoid my own characteristics. Not accepting some things that I do, or that I did.

If I don’t accept my situation, if i don’t embrace myself, I’m going to live in a lie. We need to know objectively who we are to improve. For example with the girls, I have the need for they, or something else. But the point is that I have something. Accepting that is the first step to improve it.

Denying the things that I’m living won’t carry me anywhere, neither lying me.

I need to know myself, know my skills and defects. I need to listen my inner voice. If I have a need for something, don’t avoid it.

After socializing at ORT, after talking with Giselle and after receiving a message from Juli to meet, Im extremely driven

There is no place where I cant be productive. It's just a matter of how much driven I'm and how easy is to work there.

General logs/essays
~07/2017
Often I wonder whether there are real life lesson that someone could say me and save me years of work. Right now, I’m going to think what I would said to myself five years ago, when I was twelve-years-old.

~04/2017
Who am I
Through generations, the people ask themselves about who they are. Right now, I’m asking the same question. What things can I achieve during life? Where is the limit? The crisis and unhappiness could stop?

In one hand, I think that I can do everything, that is all a matter of effort, time and luck. Thus, removing the luck, I can control my path.

On the other hand, is very difficult to accomplish real things during life. Most of the activities I do end in nothing. Lately, I can’t go to night happy for the things I accomplished during the day.

Something
I think that all would be easy if I have clear what things I can do, and also know that if I do that activities I’m in a good path. It’s difficult to not have a plan. I think that if I have clear what I should do every day, the life could be easier and I could accomplish more.

Plan english
As the deadline for the early application to US universities approaches, I need to have a plan to get accepted in the college I want to.

First and foremost, my english is poor. Thus, I need to improve it. I’m trying different things to make it better. The activities I do for this are: write personal journals and essays about topics that interest me, talk to my friends in english, sing and listen songs, think in english and talk loudly to myself.

In addition to learn english, I need to prepare for the ACT math and science and the SAT II. The ACT math is easy, and the ACT science is a little bit more difficult. Likewise the SAT II Math is simple, meanwhile the SAT II Physics can come with some difficulties, because I need to know some theory that I don’t know yet.

Ultimately, I must complete some essays talking about the activities I do and what I want to do in the future. I think that is good to have a counselor to help me in writing this essays.

In conclusion, the most important thing I need to do right now is to learn english. Then, I’m going to practice for the ACT and SAT II. Finally, I’m going to write a lot of essays and think which activities I can do to improve my personal presentation.

28/1/17: Simon Sinek millennials video + own conclusions
Introduction
Yesterday, Dylan return to Canin, after 42 days. That was a good day for Canin, because now we are open to irrationalities, and we are eager to talk that in Canin.

After I saw the Simon Sinek’s video about millennials I noticed the cause of a lot of irrationalities. I saw my impatience, my desire to have all figured out and my desire to have instant gratification.

Impatience
I am impatient for example when I don’t want to sleep nor pass to the next day. When a Star Wars Clone Wars’ episode fulfill me more than working in a long-term project. When I wanted to have a girlfriend without having first a relationship with that girl (i.e. Martina Huertas). There also applies that I was seeing only the mountain peak without seeing the ride (and enjoying it).

For example when I was so cleany, I was sacrificing long-term benefits like serendipity to have instant gratification.

Mountain peak
When I had the crisis or depressions I found me trying to solve the problem in a matter of hours or days, and that was impossible. Maybe the problem took such time to be solved because of never take long-term actions against it. In the crisis I force me to do specific arbitrary stuff, without seeing (or searching) the real problem. In that time (e.g. Cilac) I detected some irrationalities in me, and wanting to be at the mountain peak and thinking that I could have all figured out, I write some tough changes to do from one day to another, and nothing in long-term.

In sports, sometimes I struggle because I don’t have results in a week or month. I have difficulties in sustaining thing in long-term without the short-term gratification of have some results or doing something that I like a lot, for example in Diamond.

In the matter of ideas, I was against to maintain things in long-term. For example I didn’t want to make ideas naturally or for a month, all days when I wake up, write an idea.

Mixing with impatience, when you understand that between the peak and the floor there is a hill, I think that then you need to train your patience to enjoy the ride.

All figured out
Time back at school, all things were clear and straightforward; If I study, I will have good marks. Then in olympics although it was somewhat more difficult, it was the same. Then in Personas Perdidas, some things changed. At that time I was doing stuff no more in a short-term, but in a medium-term.

I was uncertain, and that was difficult for me. I remember that I thought that I needed to know everything before start, for example how I was going to do the database. Although I managed to be happy at the project, I remember my impatience (e.g. wanting to be at the web of personasperdidas.org.ar). Also, the instant gratification of having something working fulfilled me. Finally, the TEDx talks and journalism gave me many more gratification which help me not to go away of the project (even more, it was difficult to me to think of leave the project).

When the grupal projects came, I continued trying to have all figured out. I thought that I was in the position of knowing all. In that time, I didn’t want to wait to have a team or idea, all I wanted was starting, and if it was all in a day, better.

Naturally, in Diamond, I was searching for a recipe that contains all the knowledge to start a startup, because I wanted to have all figured out. And that was impossible, it is impossible to not have uncertainties in stuff like grupal projects, things happen in the ride, and nobody knows everything. Now I am observing situations when I want to have all figured out and consciously think about it.

Force me
Yesterday I told to Dylan that he maybe found this approach useful. In a lot of situations in the past, I found me forcing me to do things that I don’t want at the moment, for example talk in public, do exercise, study or meditate. I think that the best approach is to observe the feelings that I have at the moment (and in other days too) and then analyze, with the objective of find the problem that is under all. I think that force oneself does nothing but worsen the things, first you are doing something that you don’t want to, you aren’t listening or taking attention to your feelings, you mix the data about feelings to analyze and you finish destroying your inner calm and peace. It’s like forcing someone to write with the unskilled hand.

Instant gratification
I think that this mixes with impatience. Yesterday, before going to Creactivis I found me trying to solve some programming issue in Diamond. It was getting late, but I irrationally needed that gratification of finish something. I pushed something bugged to the development branch, so I wanted to fast solve the error (I think that I wanted that for not feel me inferior). I rationally knew that I was unable to push anything at that moment, but I irrationally continue letting time pass.

When I feel bad, like in a crisis, I didn’t want to be there, I wanted to go away at that very moment. I was negating that I was in a crisis, and that didn’t let me to do a good observation of mine.

Entertainment is a good example of instant gratification, most of the things are short-term (or at least the way that I’m taking entertainment). In Star Wars for example, when I saw a episode, I was looking for short-term teachings, and I wasn’t searching for a long-term understanding.

~01/2017: Essays
Analyzing my situation on essays
In one hand, there are a lot of essays that when I read it, I feel like I figured out a lot of interesting things, that will help in my life. There are a lot of interesting and powerful thoughts right there, but for a weird reason, when the time pass, I don’t feel that read that essays is good.

In the other hand, I think that not all the thoughts have to come out of me. That makes no sense! Read books or take courses is very powerful, but I’m thinking if that extends to read essays.

Take away
For first, I think that take the essays as gold, isn’t the best way. Maybe they not apply for me at this moment, or I’m searching for a confirmation bias. I’m the only that knows which is the best advice for me.

After all, we are kinda the sum of the other heads plus our own process. We need the other heads, but also we need our own head processing all the information. I think that reading an essay at the same time that we are thinking about it, calling our own opinion, being uncertain at it, can be very very powerful.

If we read a lot of this essays in a day, or even in an hour, something is working bad. We can’t digest so many information in a day, and we will forget things. So if we read more than, say 5 essays, we are reading only for the dopamine and short term satisfaction that read that essays will generate in us.

The issue now is see how I feel with this new dynamic of analyzing more the essays.

Think alone
Also, I can’t forget that I need to think a lot alone. With the essays or not, thinking alone is extremely good. Weeks ago, I was afraid of think alone. But, with calm, the best things can come out.

Some bad decisions came out because of not listening my inner voice, feelings or fears.

A lot of good decisions came out after thinking a lot alone.

I have a inner voice saying me that the two lines above maybe aren’t true. I will continue listening and experimenting to see if what I’m saying is true.

This essays turno

I’m adopting this way of thinking, and I’ll see what turn out to be.

~01/2017
So, I have the need of girls. Usually I do the comparison between girls and projects. Now, I’m doing projects and I have not relationship with girls. If, for example, I hadn’t a project, then I would have a lot of anxiety, and I would be wondering a lot of what is having a project. I think that the same happens with girls. Only in a very few moments in my life I put in the same time in girls that I usually put in projects.

I wonder a lot about girls and having a girlfriend. Also I spend a lot of time seeing other’s relations. For some time I denied thinking in girls, but now I think that that isn’t the way.

I’m going to spend more time in the topic, in a smart and calm way. Without anxiety, of course, I can project beyond the short term. In this smart way, I will start with friends in general, to practice and to expand the people that I know.

How do I work
Fear to sleep
The fear to sleep maybe is related to the two ocassions when I think about the fear of dead at night

Anxiety
Since aprox. 5 years ago, I have problems with saliva. Usually, the problem starts with the summer and ends with the end of the summer. Also the problem is bigger at night, maybe for the position, or maybe for the anxiety. I think that this problem is related to the anxiety. As the situations accompany the relation with the anxiety, in some days full of anxiety, the problem was bigger.

Saliva: anxiety’s indicator

Counter-intuitive behaviors
Don’t be at bed unless I’m trying to sleep, and also I’m tired.
Don’t use Tandem or Speaky. It gives me too much anxiety
Meditate is so powerful! Usually, I forgot its power
Don’t start to see TV / start to listen to Franco Belloni
Play football with a lot of energies

Me
Characteristics of me
At the end of the summer I become almost crazy
Something different I have, an ability let me win almost everything. This isn’t be that I’m skilled, it’s time and practice, maybe is the determination of win

Click
I suppose that I do the click when I was 12 years old, but when I was 12 years old, the click I had done at 11 years old, a little bit before enter ORT

Constantly change
I am growing constantly, I’m nothing to do with me a year age. People is the same for ten years, they continue doing the things as the same as ten years ago, without learning new things, without change
This let you change the things more easily

Be a legend
Be a legend is to draw attention?
I do, at some way, in San Ladislao and ORC
It’s break the standards and do great things

Thoughts about santi
If I would want to come up with ideas consciously thinking about them, it would be impossible. However, when I’m focused on reading something, I come up with good thoughts and ideas. Usually what I’m reading isn’t related at all to the ideas.

A guy next to me in the airplane uses the religion to minimize his fears about dying in the airplane. I used the logic to minimize them. If it is an spectrum, what would an advanced species use?
Religion
Logic
?????

Is it possible to create a keyboard that’s used with only one hand? So you don’t need to take your hand off the mouse.

Importance of formalization
It’s not that intuitive that when two objects depend on the same variable, it is canceled. And now the relationships between those two objects doesn’t depend on that variable.

Part of distractions are just letting alive our need for “chusmerio”

If we point a telescope to a reflexive point (like a mirror) in the space, can we see the Earth million of years ago?

AI
Hardcoded stuff in humans: Liking for the small stuff. That feeling that provokes saying “Oh… It’s so cute.”

the definition of what is working hard depends on the person. a friend of mine said that all his weekends were dedicated to spend time with his girlfriends. It seems an excess to me.

Action-justification: when you are writing, you have action-justification to keep (not removing) what you just wrote. If you return to the same place some minutes later, it’s more probable to delete it.

En la big pciture, los pequeños detalles imperfectos no important. Just as when you are in an airplane and all the farms seen pretty perfect.

is there any way to measure animal happiness/ to compare it to that of humans?

back to the mean: that's the problem if you are rodeado de other people (like gi) you return to the mean easily. or with most of the people. maybe all

We (people)= do things wrong mainly because we are unhappy. Maybe, most of the people is unhappy because they didn’t find what they love.

Without solution: how not to get trapped into doing useless stuff (washing the car)?
Postulate: having an interesting (maybe hard) problem

Rl + Neuroevoution + … is the lisp of our epoch

Women are being emancipated. I think something similar could happen with teenagers in the future.

Just seeing some kids (six year old) discussing as adults demonstrate how pointless are adult discussions.

Becoming an adult (or becoming most of the things) only shows how pointless was the desire of being that first thing. (the same with girlfriends)

When don't know the solution to something, a good idea is to try new things and not to stay static thinking.

Maybe Giselle doesn’t know more about the common app, but, as she seems confident because she isn’t filling hers own app, she looks more knowledgable

a great thing of having a shortage of time is that we focus on the important things

Any language should be taught as the differential between the language one wants to learn and hers native language

Tough decisions aren't tough only because the two (or more) ways are equal, but because we fear losing things, losing doors. In a today's decisions, I had the possibility of sleeping more or going to assure the gym mark. I was thinking that I had the two things and trying to think which was the best option to lose. Instead, we can think that we already lost the two and we have the possibility of putting alive one.

Why do we blow our snots (sonarse los mocos). I think that primes (monos) didn't do that. Maybe is something added by the society.

Imagine you teletransport to other place. How can we be sure that you still feel like you did before? Even though the new you assures she is you, maybe she doesn't feel like you. She can be a robot without the feeling of living you had in the first place. This can also happen during life (for instance, when we pass from being a teen to being an adult.)

Do you remember the errors I had reading the statements of the OMA problems? Well, maybe we can extend that to life. Imagine that we read wrongly the statement of some thing of life. All the development is gonna be wrong. Maybe that generates the value of the doubt. It seems important to doubt the statement of life frequently.

when there isn’t a correct answer, maybe it is because the topic is noise (like marketing )

what happens if we excite all the senses? When we eat something delicious, we excite the mouth. When we listen good music, we excite our “ears”. When we see an excellent landscape, we excite the “eyes”. When I say “eyes” or “mouth” I mean the part of the brain related to these senses.

Global optima -- generation
Local optima --- Life
Less than local optima --- short term memory

Some things don’t work at the first time, nor second, nor up to the ten. It’s pretty difficult to keep trying when you try to do something and you didn’t success. What says us that we are going to succeed in the eleventh try? almost nothing...

Nobody has time!!! Not having time is a non valid excuse

If we are trying to remember some word, for example, take the word “casa”, if we say “el”, are we gonna take more time to remember the word “casa” than if we don’t say an article?

There are some things that force us to work hard (e.g. KA) and others that not (e.g. correct errors of the SAT)

Life is a mix between enjoying and getting out of the comfort zone. If I'm not doing any of that, just quit when possible.

It's important to not make decisions in the moments that those decisions are going to influence. For example, do not decide whether is better or not to eat roast beef with a roast beef as dish. If we do that, we are going to have more action justification that in other cases

The most common languages consist in reducing or increasing the things we are referring to. We define that each sentence corresponds to one element in a set of all the sentences. When we say nothing we are referring to everything, as we talk we reduce or increase the set of things we are referring. For example, if we say house, we reduce the things we are referring to to houses. Then, if we add big, we reduce to big houses. We can add elements to the set, for example big houses and dogs. The person who talks imagines the set of possibilities, given by the context, that the listeners have. Then, the objective of the speakers is to reduce the possibilities to one for all the listeners.

The length of a group is directly proportionally to the burocracy/lack of change

The larger one activity is from the objective, the less motivation we have in it.

Dylan and me have the same errors, so if we can recognize where we are weak we can select the option that our intuition doesn’t like.

The kids lie because is a good system

During life, never we can do what we want at 100%. Right now, I want to program or do Creactivis but I'm paying a lot of attention to studying for the SAT. When having a business, the people should pay attention to get investors and bureaucracy stuff.

Theory of multiple choice
 (knowing that the circle was counterclockwise, D is the correct)

Knowing that I have a lot of things to do prevent me even to start and focus in one specific thing at a time. When I realized that I have a lot of things to do, I get nervous and I try to do more than one thing at once. But, when I start with some specific thing, I realized that it is easy.
Getting angry if I get an error is a boludez.

Life is an infinite game

Importance of saying no

In general, people likes a lot a few things (80/20 rule). Part of understanding the people is related with their likes. Maybe by how they grew up, or by context, they have some specific likes. That likes (e.g. play football or that you like the color blue) influence in your decisions and mold your life.

Hypothesis: Psycology fartrs happen
because the people come into a great emotional state. They are ephemeral because when you leave the group, all the people outside don’t have that emotional state, therefore you end up averaging with them

When you can show off (like using the force to show off, or sherlock) you need to be with somewhat inferior people

In most of the adult’s conversations, most of the talked are spam. But often there are gold nuggets, in general very related with the field where the adult is working. Sometimes it’s worth endure the spam to get the gold. You need to pay attention if you don’t want to lose it.

Thesis: The stuff the people do is related with how depth is their base and that is related with be afraid to the death

Content (movie vs pg): Atrapante vs Useful

Correlation between fear to die and personalities

For the sake of the argument, a risk decrease the life duration by some specific time.
Say, for example, that don’t taking a risk increase your life duration by an hour, but takes you two hours preventing that risk. In this case take the risk is obviously the better option.
Someone takes risks depending on the value of his life. What happens when the life is infinite?
If the life is infinite, taking risks has no sense at all.

When you are growing, as time pass, you notice the faults of the old life's model.
You change the old life's model because you have more time to think and more information. I think most of the errors we have during life arent real errors.
What an error is?

When I sleep less than 7 hours I feel negative. Today i sleep less than 7 hours and I feel like the things were bad, that all the options I had were bad. Then, when I was in swimming I realized that the problem that I was considering was nonexistent

The happiness and no happiness go hand in hand, and adds zero?

All the time they use the music, the mysticism, the power of the words and the power of be a lot, as a resource

The nature is beautiful, and the life is completely magic, incomprehensible.
The mysticism is go near of the magic in the life

We pass like a half of the day in automatic pilot, doing repetitious actions, and running a worst version of us

We have not to duplicate, we must do libraries
Some things can belong to different categories
For example, a calendar shares content with a schedule, a to-do list and photos

In the world are a lot of people living right now, and only 200 millions take advantage of their time, for the develop of the society.
That means that there are a collective waste of time, and we need to take advantage of that free time

If you do a lot of thing, you produce more, although you get burned.
One is strictly efficient in some things, and in others not. Example: The traffics and the meals.

At the start of our lives, we can prepare to anything, but when the days go, some things already happen, so all days you are in the top of your life

This can be separated in short and long terms
The result can be in a short or long term, and can be relevant or irrelevant
Success
Things that increase the self esteem, performance or reputation
Is when something good that has few possibilities to happen, happens
Example: Found something in the bus (short), study something important to the life (long)
Failures
Things that hurt the self esteem, performance or reputation
Is when something bad that has few possibilities to happen, happens
Example: Fracture (short), study something that you didn’t like (long)

There are two types of value: Natural and artificial
The value is generated by the people, isn’t about the functionality of the things, is about the offer, the quantity. Examples: Water and artworks
There are invaluable things such as the value of a life
A boob don’t have any value, but because are all covered, generates avarice to see. But really is nothing
Artificial value
Things that aren’t functional by themselves, but the people generates value for them, for example money
The society impose that things
Natural value
Which are the things that have a natural value?

The music is a stimulating, so we only can use in motivation moments, and anymore
If we listen a lot of music, the music level fall
The music generates remembers

It will no be extension of files in the future

The first open source was when the old people told their stories to remain in eternity

The decentralization is powerful, for example that all houses produces energy on his own

People reaction
For the average people, the strong content is seen with enthusiasm, and this generate and addiction. But this doesn’t grow as the demand, to cover the free time of the people. For this, the weak content exist

Reasons of existence
The people is caught by the strong content, and kept with the weak.
There is double market.

Human behavior
Blank sheet
A lot of kids have the pain to the blank sheet
They want to start something, but they don’t know how to do it, and then they become frustrated

Pain
Is a sense that you generates to yourself
For take advantage that other or you are hurting yourself
If everyone knows which things give hurt, the pain will be unnecessary

Discomforts
The majority of the discomforts are mentals and they leave don’t thinking at them

Ancestral and configurable variables
Ancestral: We can’t change them
Configurable: We can, with effort, change them

Take risks
At some situations, you take a lot of risks more than in other situations, for example to cross the street you wait a lot, but you eat some rotten without think it, and this can have more risks.

Levelate
You sometimes are greater than others in some topics, and you tease or lie when other do one level less questions, but when they do two level less questions, doesn’t matter.
Prillo for example is infinitely levelate

Old people
They want to talk, but nobody want to listen them
They give affection, but they aren’t crack as kids
They aren’t crack, only give tenderness

People
There are a lot of people alone, that haven’t family or friends, and they lost the human natural motivation
The average of people follow the society, so they aren’t good
We born awake, and the society sleep us

Groups
At all places, are generated small groups, with similar minds applies. They tend to some group, and then be in the comfort zone
In 4th when I was searching for friends, I see that the weird people, meets with other weird people
If someone good goes with a group of bad, the average of the bad grow a little, but the good fall a lot

School
Results
The school only pay attention to the results and the marks, not to the process

Motivation
The only motivation is the title and not the learning
The school isn’t funny and put pression in the kids

Negative effects
Creativity and imaginative are degraded
The school give the question and the answer without the possibility of discover anything.
They do the things in a systematic way, without allowing freedom

Competition
They promote the competition between kids, which destroys the relations

Time
The school consumes the best time in the day

Teachers
The teachers are like the owners of the knowledge

Learning
The best learning is through experiences

Ideals
The ideals in the schools are: individualism, same age, little possibility to grow, and little creativity

Changes
The school have very little changes, and the kids haven’t the opportunity of see different schools

The ten
The measurements of the school are absurd, the ten is like you could not do better and that is lie, nobody is perfect

Hard work
I’m trying to focus on doing hard work and keeping aside all the fake work. It’s very easy to distinguish between work in general and entertainment. Sadly, it’s not as easy to discern between fake and hard work.

It’s known that entertainment doesn’t guide to success. Yes, it can help us to get relaxed, but the time we should spend on relaxing is small. Thus, as it’s simple to know what is entertainment (e.g. TV, games) if we want, we can avoid them without too much problem.

In contrast, it’s tough to know what is hard work and what is fake work. For example, both can be boring and effortful. The motivation in differentiating between hard and fake work it’s clear: we want to be successful -by definition, the hard work is the direct path to it.

In consequence, I’m analyzing the different ways to identify hard work, here are the things I found:

Difficulty
Although hard work is almost always laborious, usually we can find fake work that has the same or more difficult. Thus, we can say that if some work is easy, it’s not going to be hard work. However, if the work is challenging, we can’t draw conclusions.

Conditions
The more conditions we put to the hard work, the more it’s converted to fake work. For instance, I was looking to learn English in a matter of weeks, without dedicating too much time neither paying too much money. I put so many conditions that, in retrospective, it makes a lot of sense that I would get nothing of my try of learning English.

We can do fake work at any time, without too much preparation, and putting a lot of conditions in it.
That doesn’t happen with the hard work. The hard work is a defined path, and we can’t change it. In most cases, we adapt to the hard work.

Motivation to start
This point seems to me as a very efficient. We often require a lot of effort to start some hard-working activity. For instance, I need a lot of willpower to start doing sport or writing essays.

In contrast, when I’m doing fake work, it’s easy to start. I can watch a YouTube video in a matter of two clicks. I can read one random essay in five seconds. Without almost any effort I can do something extremely similar to work.

I think that it’s good to hesitate if it’s very easy to start some activity.

Reading one random book is as easy to find as useless to read.

Reading the book we need for our needs is as difficult to find as useful to read.

People opinions
What the people say about what you do can be nonsense, but common sense is very stable and straightforward that maybe we can make some conclusions.

Most of the people aren’t going to be supportive nor happy with you if you do hard work. Doing hard work requires a lot of effort, and some people simply don’t want to know that what they are doing is fake work. If you do hard work, then you will demonstrate them that they can do a lot more to achieve success. In general, the people have shields that protect them of thinking that what they are doing is crap.

Imagine that, from all the people, we take the portion of them that think they are doing hard work. The majority of that people is doing fake work so we can take the average of what they are doing and take that as an example of fake work.

Time
No great thing can be achieved in a day. All the important things the humanity did, took years or even decades. A startup, for example, may take five years of full-time work. Be an excellent programmer may take ten years. And yet, we are trying to learn a new language in ten days, or we are reading a book/essay/article about “How to be successful in ten days.” We must leave our anxiety of getting results in the short term.

Likes
Imagine that we are studying since two hours ago, and we take a break to get some snack before continue studying another two hours. Depending on the activity, we can have two very different behaviors in the break: (a) we make the duration of the break as lengthen as possible or (b) we finish the break ASAP to get back to work.

It’s likely that in the former case we are not doing hard work and we do in the latter. Usually, the difference between the two cases is whether we like what we are doing or not. It requires a lot of effort to do hard work in something we don’t like. I think that is more efficient to spend that willpower to do hard work instead of entertainment / fake work.

WIP: masterplan Creactivis
I feel that the development of Creactivis is going really slow. Moreover, I feel this since I’m trying to be organizer in Creactivis. I wonder if this is going to stop. Maybe it is because nobody is dedicating too much hours, perhaps it is Martin’s fault because he is slow, reasonably, it could be that as the workshop is once per week, we can’t make too much progress, or possibly, is that the adults have a very slow rhythm when doing things, and for them it is common the actual pace of Creactivis.

Fastener
It’s clear that the slowness is dragging us down. We need to decrease the time it takes to implement new politics (e.g. change from once per week to twice per week).

Get together the kids
Creactivis is a club, I think that the first thing the kids should do in Creactivis is make friends. If there are too many mentors, the groups can’t be assembled. I think that groups of three is a good way to start. With two, if they are somewhat different, they would confront, therefore, if we are sure that the two are going to form a good group, two can be a good number. Four is too much, but again, it can go good in specific cases.

There are two groups of three right now: the group that is doing the camera in the vase, and the group that is doing the labyrinthus.

What can we learn of that two groups? First, they are, by far, the six persons that play more to the ping pong. Second, as how the things developed, they haven’t a mentor who is all Creactivis long with them. Third, in my opinion, the groups are integrated by one crack-calmed person (Bruno, Franco), one crack-extroverted person, and one extroverted person.

Agus, Bruno Ziger and NIco need to have a group

WIP: Meditation & Habits
Usually, we are living in a low-consuming mode (like the unconscious mode, but a little bit more powerful). That’s ok for most situations, but there are a few that need all our attention, for example, when we are deciding what we are going to do for the whole day. When executing the actions during that day, we don’t need to be in the powerful mode.

There will always be moments better than others for taking decisions. I think that it makes no sense to consider that we are always in the same mode, we are humans and we are emotional beings, we don’t have infinite willpower. (Actually, we can be in the same mode always, but also we can spend more willpower to think in a specific moment and take time out of the other moments. I think the latter is by far more useful).

Habits
Habits are one implementation of this. We decide some crucial things in some good days, and then we can routinary do that habits without considering too much whether there are good or bad.

It’s clear that the moment we define the habits must be a good and polished one. Furthermore, we need to be sure that what we are doing is the best thing we can do, having confidence in the decisions I took later.

Decisions
Maybe, is good to give a lot of time to big decisions, not for more time to think but for going through different modes.

It’s important to discern between meaningful and useless decisions. During our life, most decision will look as big deals while they have no real importance at all.

Meditation
To meditate is a great action to enter in a powerful mode. All the environment (e.g. websites, smartphone) is trying to get our attention. There are a few ways to avoid all that distractions and think in our own. Alongside meditation, we can go out and walk, preferably if we are alone. Hiking is an excellent activity, we can think on our own while we connect with the nature.

Starting the day
At morning, when we are starting

IDK what is this
All is physics, there are no magic inside us. Ok, perfect, that’s only a definition. What about living the life, doing things, etc?

There are many biases the people have that a talk can be converted into nonsense stuff if someone doesn’t have that bias.

When I’m mentoring kids or explaining something easy, I feel super confident, like that I had all figured-out. Maybe this is part of the bad mentality of the teachers, and more generally of the adults.

During life, I passed through many different steps. Almost always the new step convert all the old knowledge in useless. For instance, months ago I was doing projects like a mini company, paying attention to all the business stuff, and not doing something that mainly interested me. After leaving the last project and weeks of thinking, together with my team, we realize that the best way to do a project is to do things we are interested in, not paying attention to business at all. Besides the business stuff, I was sort of obsessed with lead the project, and that, as was with the business part of the project, disappear with the new way of doing projects.

If life is constantly changing, and all the things I do will turn out to be wrong soon or later, when should we stop and settle down? In startups, there are an advice that says “In some occasions the projects should be continued even though it has no sense at all”.

As the time goes by, all the projects and actions we do are going to be poor. That is an indicator of success, of improvement. If that doesn’t happen we are not trying harder enough, we are not leaving our comfort zone.

I think we should have an open mind about this and recognize it. When we see our firsts drawings, essays and talks, we know that they are full of errors and we don’t want to show them to anybody. What a bad system! If only we just show them to somebody, we can improve a lot in a matter of minutes.

Moreover, adults never venture into new things because of the fear of having errors. In fact, all the things we do are full of errors. Actually, the adults are afraid to the illusion of having errors or more direct, they are afraid of the things the other people think of them, again, what a bad system!

If somebody knows too little is bad, because the people hate errors. Why people hate errors? Maybe it is because we need to think to avoid it, and think is an effortful action. Perhaps it happens because the people can have a high social status lowing the others.

If somebody knows too much also is bad for society, people don’t want to know that they are wrong, they have years of action justification.

Lucca - 250 words
Prompt: Tell us about something that is meaningful to you and why. (100 to 250 words)

I don’t believe in all-powerful gods. Instead, I believe that we, the people, have the power. The power isn't in one man but in the connection between them. Indeed, you feel the power when you look at that person you love into his/her eyes.

However, some people can’t bear this, people suffering from bullying, people socially excluded. They aren’t enjoying the best delight of living: connecting with others.

Trying to help, I became the programming tutor for four kids in Creactivis, a social community I've gone since 2013.

Lucca, one of my students, was quite shy the first time he came. And whenever I asked him something, he just didn’t answer. I tried talking about games and websites. None worked. And the situation was becoming tense.

Trying to understand what Lucca was thinking, an idea appeared: YouTubers. We talked about them, and the conversation got much more fluent. Then, I told Lucca he could make YouTube-like animations himself. When we started working on those animations, he made one of the most astonishing faces I’ve ever seen.

An acquaintance of Lucca later told me he suffers from Asperger Syndrome, a developmental disorder characterized by significant difficulties in socializing. Immediately, I realized that Creactivis would be life-changing for Lucca and his peers. For this reason, I’m focused on expanding Creactivis, and I’ve been leading the growth from ten to thirty students. And maybe, more kids would receive the most wonderful opportunity of life: connecting with people.




Lucca - 650 words
Prompt: Tell us about a person who has influenced you in a significant way / topic of your choice.

Todo: Talk more about the Lucca interaction. Add something funny. Reach 550 words.

Thesis: I care about Lucca. I’m a nice person when interacting when Lucca. Underlying motivations in Creactivis.

“The kingdom of God is among the people.” Luke 17:21, The Bible.

I don’t believe in all-powerful gods. Instead, I believe that we, the people, have the power. The power isn't in one man but in the connection between them. When people got together is when the world biggest achievements happened. Indeed, you feel the power when you look at that person you love into his/her eyes.

However, some people can’t bear this. There are people suffering from bullying. There are people socially excluded. They aren’t enjoying the best delight of living: connecting with others.

This is part of my motivation to organize and teach in Creactivis, a social community I’ve gone as a student since 2013. Now, I’m the programming tutor for four energetic kids.

Lucca, one of my students, was quiet and shy the first time he came. Whenever I asked him something, he just didn’t answer. I tried talking about sports and websites. None worked. And the situation was becoming tense.

Some minutes before completely losing Lucca’s attention, I discovered a technique that now I use with all my students: forget about myself and try to guess what Lucca was thinking and what he wanted.

After thinking for a while, I remembered that lots of kids like YouTube videos. Jackpot! He loves YouTube. We started talking about our favorite YouTubers. He became relaxed, and the talk got much more fluent. Apart from keeping the conversation, I was thinking hard about how he could learn something new from Creactivis.

Lucca had shown a passion for video games. I remember when he revealed me a folder in his notebook with all the video games he had. It was like his treasure! I told him he could develop video games like those he played. And he made one of the most amazing faces I’ve ever seen. Lucca was excited about learning. I taught him some basic programming concepts, and he understood quite good the ideas.

Thus, I put him together with three more students. Again, Lucca had some troubles when integrating with the group. For example, one day he left the table with his three friends and went to a desk outside Creactivis’s environment. When I found him, I saw him alone with his headphones and notebook. Certainly, integrating into a group was tough for Lucca. But the Creactivis’s climate and students’ warmness worked together to include him. Now, they form an excellent team. They started to develop a 3D game. And they created their own Skype group to play video games outside Creactivis.

At the end of his first class, Lucca was euphoric. And when his parents came, he proudly showed the work he’d done. Before leaving Creactivis, Lucca always tells me,

“I can't wait for the next class. During the week, I’m always waiting for Fridays to come to Creactivis!”

When Lucca’s mother comes to pick up him, she also makes an astonishing face, as if something magical was happening in Creactivis. And maybe it’s happening.

An acquaintance of Lucca later told me he suffers from Asperger Syndrome, a developmental disorder characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction. Immediately, I realized that Creactivis would be life-changing for Lucca and his peers. In this community, they find an inclusive space to share time with friends who have the same love and curiosity for video games and programming.

For this reason, I’m focused on expanding Creactivis. I’ve been leading the growth from ten to thirty students. And maybe, more kids would receive the most wonderful opportunity of life: connecting with people.






AGI - 250
Prompt: The Stanford community is deeply curious and driven to learn in and out of the classroom. Reflect on an idea or experience that makes you genuinely excited about learning. (100 to 250 words)

When I started to code, at 12, I created a program that answered questions. If it didn’t know the answer, it would learn it by receiving feedback from the user. That meant that a computer, with enough training, could answer any question. It was amazing! There, not only I discovered how powerful Computer Science was, but also a question appeared: what if computers could be more intelligent than humans?

That question intrigued me a lot. And I started to learn about Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. I read papers, took courses, and built programs.

I extract bits of knowledge from every situation to understand better our brain. For example, I learned the power of imitation by observing how my baby cousin learns. (She's so cute while learning!) Thanks to these observations, sometimes a set of realizations pop into my head like a domino, and it’s excellent.

With four friends fascinated by Artificial Intelligence, I made a research team. We’ve been investigating and creating our own algorithms. With everything we built, we wrote a research paper. Also, In this group I have my favorite conversations: everybody proposes his ideas, and we build upon the knowledge of the other. It’s like thinking at 3x speed!

I think I can answer the question I asked five years ago: getting a computer with the same general intelligence than a human will be the most significant revolution in the history. And I’m doing my best to be part of this revolution.

That meant that a computer, with enough training, could answer any question. It was amazing! There, not only I discovered the powerfulness of Computer Science, but also a goal appeared: building a computerized brain.

To understand more about this topic, I started to learn about intelligent computers: I took a course on Machine Learning and another on Computerized Neuroscience, I read papers, and I built programs. Studying about this topic excites me.

YALE: And attending Yale University could stimulate me in this area in different ways. First, when I started researching about Yale, I noticed that its Computer Science department is expanding. That showed me that CS is a top priority for Yale. Secondly, I always try to go beyond what I know. And Yale’s academic rigor could push my knowledge boundaries.

PRINCETON:  And attending Princeton University could stimulate me in this area in two ways. First, when I started to research about Princeton, lots of reviews agree that Princeton has a strong focus on undergraduates. I like that professors are approachable, enthusiastic about their students, and focused on giving clear lectures. Secondly, I always try to go beyond what I know. And Princeton’s academic rigor could push my knowledge boundaries.

CORNELL: And attending Cornell University could stimulate me in this area in different ways. First, I always try to go beyond what I know. And Cornell’s academic rigor could push my knowledge boundaries. Secondly, Cornell’s program could give me a solid foundation in CS but enough flexibility to learn about the topic from different perspectives. That’s valuable because there are lots of fields that relate to the brain, such as Anthropology, Biology, or Neuroscience. Thirdly, I value Cornell excellent faculties, with more than 40 Nobel prize winners affiliated. I certainly could learn a lot from them

With four friends fascinated by Artificial Intelligence, I made a research team. We’ve been investigating and creating our own algorithms. In this group, I have my favorite conversations: everybody proposes his ideas, and we build upon the knowledge of the other. It’s like thinking at 3x speed! With all that we built, we wrote a research paper. The opportunities I had to research in my school were limited.

YALE:

PRINCETON: I think this is completely different in Princeton. And that excites me a lot. In a review by a student, I read that a Princeton faculty said, “we love working with undergraduates on research. In fact, sometimes we give undergraduates the strangest and most challenging problems.“ That’s excellent for me! Building a computerized brain is certainly challenging. Also, as building a brain requires views from different perspectives, the interdisciplinary programs on research at Princeton appeal to me. I also value that Princeton Engineering brings together people from different backgrounds and academic disciplines.

CORNELL: However, an education at Cornell University could provide me several research opportunities. Cornell has one of the leading Artificial Intelligence groups in the world. Particularly, I’m impressed by its Machine Learning research group. Also, I find fascinating the cooperation between the different research groups in Cornell. Indeed, understanding the brain requires that cooperation.

/*
Another experience I had in Engineering was the informatics olympiads. I’ve participated since I’m 13 years. In this olympiad, I learned a lot of programming.

PRINCETON: Thirdly, as I stated in my personal essay math attracts me. So the focus on math and theory that Princeton has excites me.
*/

Also, I’m interested in launching a tech startup. I participated in two educational small startups. And I know that the way startups behave matches the way I like to work: doing something I love and working hard to improve the product. Although I learned a lot doing these startups, I think that some experience will improve my chances of success.

PRINCETON: Princeton has a vibrant community passionate about building startups. The Keller Center startup incubators and lectures make Princeton an excellent place to launch a startup. Also, the Entrepreneurship Club drew my attention for being one of the largest groups at Princeton. Reading some reviews, I noticed how Princeton’s student remark the great deal of advice, support, and a strong community for startups that Princenton gives.

CORNELL: Cornell has an excellent startup environment and is focused on giving its alumnus exciting opportunities, such as Cornell Silicon Valley that connect alumnus with industry innovators. Cornell is known for having very smart alumnus, and this will help me in getting a co-founder for launching the startup. Also, the eLab (Cornell accelerator for student startups) is characterized by its interdisciplinary, a topic that fascinates me.

I think I can answer the question I asked five years ago: getting a computer with the same general intelligence than a human will be the most significant revolution in the history. And I’m doing my best to be part of it. I know that to make a revolution I need knowledge and hard-work. For me, learning and researching are the best activities I can do in my next four years. I’m sure that if this revolution is achieved with responsibility, the world will dramatically improve. Probably, humans won’t need to work any more, and as we don’t need to pay machines, humans will have enough money to live a good life. This will enable the world population to work on the things we really love without money constraints.

With four friends fascinated by Artificial Intelligence, I made a team to research about the Brain. In this group, I have my favorite conversations: everybody proposes his ideas about new algorithms, and we build upon the knowledge of the other. It’s like thinking at 3x speed! We’ve been investigating and creating our own algorithms. With all that we built, we wrote a research paper. But the opportunities I had to research were limited. However, this is different in Yale. I read that Yale gives numerous research opportunities to undergraduates. For me, the best things Yale has is the particular focus on Artificial Intelligence. The Yale's Computer Science website states that one of the two main reasons Yale focuses on Artificial Intelligence is that this type of research can shed light on understanding how people are possible. This is very close to the mission of my research team!
I think that the best way to understand the brain is relating knowledge from different disciplines such as Neuroscience, Mathematics, and Computer Science. So I did courses on Computational Neuroscience, Machine Learning, and Psychology and read books on Anthropology and Neuroevolution. I'm looking for a university that puts a great deal of importance in multidisciplinarity. After researching, I found that Yale has a culture of interdisciplinary learning. Yale's CS department is closely connected with the Engineering department and has exciting multidisciplinary research opportunities.
Another experience I had in Computer Science was the informatics olympiad. I participate in it since I was 13 years. In this Olympiad, I learned a lot about graph theory and programming in C++. From the first day I trained for this Olympiad, I tried to learn beyond what I knew and get out of my comfort zone. I think that attending Yale University could stimulate me in this area in different ways. Yale’s academic rigor could certainly push my knowledge boundaries.
Also, when I started researching about Yale, I noticed that its Computer Science department is expanding. I like that Yale recognizes the importance of Computer Science field. Indeed, CS is a top priority for Yale.
In the last years, I participated in two educational startups. The most exciting part was testing with real users and focusing on building something useful for them. Regarding startups, Yale has a vibrant community passionate about building startups. Specifically, I like Yale's institutional support. Yale is continually investing money into startups from its alumnus.


TEDx - 150
Prompt: Briefly elaborate on one of your extracurricular activities or work experiences. (150 words)

"The best thing was listening to young speakers like Santiago. He’s a highly positive effect on teenagers.” (TEDxRiodelaPlataED audience feedback.)
It all started with my first TEDx talk. My message was simple: teenagers can accomplish great things. And I spent months improving my speech, rewriting it over and over.
For my performance in that event, I was invited to talk at TEDxRiodelaPlataED and at a UNESCO Forum. I loved crafting the speeches for these two talks: it was weeks of writing ideas and experiences until the best ones appeared.
In all the events, I was the youngest speaker. And I was afraid to talk. But conveying my message was more important.
Indeed it was. One day, Mariano (16-years-old) told me that his parents believed he couldn’t achieve anything. But he said that my TEDx talks have helped him believe in himself. And proudly, he showed me the app he created.

Prompt: Write about something you would like us to know about you that you have not conveyed elsewhere in your application. (250 words)

"The best thing was listening to young speakers like Santiago. He’s a highly positive effect on teenagers.” (TEDxRiodelaPlataED audience feedback.)

It all started with my first TEDx talk. My message was simple: teenagers can accomplish great things. And I spent months improving my speech, rewriting it over and over.

For my performance in that event, I was invited to talk at TEDxRiodelaPlataED (largest Argentinian TEDx educational event). I loved crafting the speech for that talk: it was weeks of writing ideas and experiences until the best ones appeared.

After those two TEDx, I gave a talk in Chile. Before me, a rock band played; after me, a singer was going to play. And there I was, trying to convey my message to 3,000 people that were expecting anything but a kid talking about education. Another day, I was in a UNESCO Science Forum in Uruguay. It was full of influential people from around the world. I asked myself: what am I doing here?

In all the events, I was the youngest speaker. And I was afraid to talk. But conveying my message was far more important. I knew they were people that needed some motivation to start their projects. And I felt I had to support them.

The effort was completely worth it: One day, Mariano (16-years-old) told me that his parents believed he couldn’t achieve anything. But he said that my TEDx talks have helped him believe in himself. And proudly, he showed me the app he created.



Background - 250
Miguel, after suffering from a Cerebrovascular Accident, forgot in which side of the bed he slept. But his technical knowledge and passion for work remained impeccable: he went to work every day almost until his death at 71.

Ángel, leaving his entire Peruvian family to travel to Argentina at 18, was recognized in his community for being highly devoted to helping others. He was the Peruvian Cultural Center’s President, energetically assisting immigrants to adjust to their new life.

Miguel and Ángel were my grandfathers. And they modeled my personality as much as my parents, Diego and Cecilia, did.

Diego started to work at 16 in a greengrocery to help his family after losing their house to a wrong investment. And he was a volunteer firefighter for more than 25 years, completely changing the Fire Station’s values from laziness to hard-work. He loves his work.

Cecilia showed me through her actions the definition of loving others. Always ready to help her neighbors, her life goal was to raise the happiest children. She was there whenever I needed her.

Some days ago I read:

“You have two essential tasks in life: being a good person and pursuing the occupation you love.”

My family, now I realized, instructed me by example on the two most important things in life. My mother and grandfather taught me how to love and connect with others. My father and other grandfather taught me the passion for working hard - from 8am to 8pm every single day.

Miguel, after suffering from a Cerebrovascular Accident, forgot in which side of the bed he slept or which was his toothbrush. But his technical knowledge and passion for work remained impeccable: he went to work every day almost until his death at 71.

Ángel, leaving his entire Peruvian family to study in Argentina at 18, was recognized in his community for being highly devoted to helping others. He was the President of the Peruvian Cultural Center, energetically assisting immigrants to adjust to their new life. His college friends recognize him for being “always ready to lend a hand.”
Miguel and Ángel were my grandfathers. And they modeled my personality and actions as much as my parents, Diego and Cecilia, did.
Diego started to work at 16 in a greengrocery to help his family after losing their house to a wrong investment. Now, he loves his work. Diego was recognized internationally by the Social Innovation’s Carrefour Award for the work he did integrating women into the company in which he works. His work ethic is admirable: my father shows me the values of honesty and integrity by example. He was a volunteer firefighter for 25 years, completely changing the Fire Station’s values from laziness and rudeness to hard-work and security.
Cecilia showed me through her actions the definition of loving others. Always ready to help her neighbors, her life goal was to raise the happiest children possible. She was there whenever I needed her. When my brother was born, Cecilia arranged everything to work in my home so that she can be present for my brother without stopping to work.
Some days ago I read:
“You have two essential tasks in life: to be a good person and to pursue the occupation you love.”
My family, now I realized, instructed me by example on the two most important things in life. My mother and grandfather taught me how to love and connect with others. My father and other grandfather taught me the passion for working hard - from 8 am to 8 pm every single day.
I’m always trying to get better at these two areas. I deeply love the concept of connecting with others. I think this is only achievable in the right situations. And the result is excellent. Understanding others and being understood can make us have feelings that we don’t have in our day-to-day life. As weird as it can seem, I think the same happens with work. In the right moment and right work, we can achieve a state-of-mind where we are deeply connected with what we are doing, and we can continue working for hours and hours.
If accepted at Rice University, I think that this type of love, both to work and to people, would be the best contribution I could give.


Background - 100
Miguel, after suffering from a Cerebrovascular Accident, forgot in which side of the bed he slept. But his technical knowledge and passion for work remained impeccable: he went to work every day almost until his death at 71.

Ángel, leaving his entire Peruvian family to travel to Argentina at 18, was recognized in his community for being highly devoted to helping others. He was the Peruvian Cultural Center’s President, energetically assisting immigrants to adjust to their new life.

From Miguel and Ángel, my grandfathers, I learned my best asset: love, both to work and to people.


I was 8 and obsessed with understanding how things worked. "Why?" I asked my dad until he ran out of answers. "What will this marble have inside?" I tried to answer while I hammered it. Two years later, I started participating in the mathematical olympiads. That was my world: they gave me math problems and I was surrounded by people who loved what they were doing. What more could I ask for?

Actually, I could ask for more: having a computer to code. The math was interesting, but the programming was fascinating. Back then, I still had two years left before coding classes were available to me. “Two years!?!?” That seems like an infinite time when you’re 12! So I started doing courses and reading books on my own. With what I’d learned, I started making games and web pages.

Then, thanks to the programs I’d built, I realized something: teenagers don’t need to turn 18 to start influencing the real world.

When I knew this, my vision of what I could do changed completely. There was a problem that was swirling around in my head long ago, and apparently, now I could solve it. My father was a firefighter for 25 years. And he’d told me that every day, in Argentina, a person with Alzheimer's or similar diseases gets disoriented and becomes lost far from his home. Some take years to return; others never do.

There was no technological platform to help in this situation, so I came up with the idea of creating a network of volunteers connected by smartphones and computers to help find lost people.

I felt that solving the problem was my duty. But I knew that people weren’t going to take this project seriously. People would think that I was playing games all day because of my age. But, as the great Richard Feynman said,

"What do you care what other people think?"

That's how I started: being 14 and knowing a little about programming. During a year and a half, I spent most of my afternoons learning and coding for this project. I remember that feeling of “Oh. This is just impossible to accomplish.” And after a week of work, I was saying, “Ha. This couldn’t be easier.”

After that year and a half, I presented the platform to the Argentinian Organization Personas Perdidas, which looks for missing people. And after several meetings, they began using what I’d created as their official website and app. The platform received 124,000 users. And in the last two years, I’ve been using the users’ feedback to improve the site and app.

The application and website have received 450,000 page views and reached 2,770,000 people through social networks. These users have helped to search 1,100 missing persons. And the platform appeared on the cover of the two best-selling newspapers in Argentina and on the four most important television news programs in the country.

However, the impact I had on my community is more valuable for me. A mission I had in doing this project was showing my peers and myself that we can influence the real world. And I spoke in two educational TEDx and two innovation forums conveying this idea. I keep in my heart what a girl said after listening to my second TEDx,

"We, the adolescent audience, feel very identified with Santi, and he even shows us that people of our age not only have a voice but are also worthy of admiration."

I’m not a teenager anymore. But life already set me another challenge: extending life. I’ve been investigating on Artificial Intelligence and the Brain with my research team. And I realized there is nothing written in our DNA that says we have to live 110 years or less. The trip won’t be easy, but I know this research project will guide me to continue doing what I love: programming and helping people.

S: Algo que se relaciona un poco con el tema sería hacer un thought experiment (simular en la cabeza) qué pasaría si ponemos un humano actual en un contexto de hace millones de años o que pasaría si ponemos un humano de hace millones de años en el contexto actual.

A: No se si el experimento tendría muchas conclusiones interesantes: el primero se parece al escenario de Naufrago y el segundo sería casi como poner un chimpancé en capital. Como lo pensas vos? Creo que con ligeras modificaciones el experimento se puede volver interesante:
En vez de trasladar a un solo humano, trasladar a toda la humanidad
Mezclar todas las humanidades de todos los tiempos: agarrar todos los humanos que alguna vez estuvieron vivos y sus fechas de nacimiento y asignar las fechas de nacimiento aleatoriamente a cada uno de los humanos. Ver que pasa, sería muy raro.

Quizás podemos escribir en forma de debate entre nosotros dos. Otra cosa que estaría bueno considerar es que nuestro essay debería aportar algo a alguien, no ser un simple artículo.

S: Qué te parece hacer que esto mismo sea el artículo? Sería incluir desde el primer párrafo que puse hasta el fin de lo que escribamos.

S: Sobre que le aporte algo a alguien, vale que esos alguien seamos nosotros? En cosas de startups muchas veces dicen que te enfoques en hacer algo que te sirva mucho a vos solo, sin fijarte en los clientes.

S: Claro, trasladar a toda la humanidad sería más “justo” y más conclusivo. Sería divertido ver cómo la información (tanto la que tenemos almacenada en la cabeza como la que está en un soporte externo) nos define. Por ejemplo, qué pasaría si de repente sacamos toda la información que tenemos en un soporte externo, o mejor, qué tanto hubiéramos progresado sin la posibilidad de un soporte externo? A lo que me intentaba referir al principio de todo es ver si físicamente la humanidad actual tiene diferencia con la de hace millones de años o es solo el soporte el que hace que nos diferenciamos tanto de nuestros antepasados.

A: Esto definitivamente va a ser divertido. Respondiendo a si es solo el soporte externo lo que hace que la humanidad sea como es:
Como primer impedimento, tenes el concepto de neuroplasticidad. Nuestros cerebros sufren cambios estructurales y funcionales para adaptarse al ambiente. Por lo tanto, nuestros soportes externos ya han condicionado definitivamente nuestras redes neuronales.
A nivel más general, no existe tal cosa como un humano “limpio”, “reseteado” o “sin soporte externo”. Básicamente, estamos definidos por la compleja interacción entre genes y ambiente. Un gen no es nada sin el ambiente, ya que un gen flotando en el mar no expresa ninguna característica. Es solo mediante el contacto con el ambiente que los genes expresan características y una vez que ese contacto sucede, ya se tiene un soporte externo.

A: En conclusión, creo yo, nuestras redes neuronales se vieron irreversiblemente modificadas por el “soporte externo” y resulta imposible separar humano y soporte. La pregunta es, hasta que punto es eso verdad? Una cosa que se me ocurre es que si el progreso actual fuese solo el resultado del progreso acumulado en la historia, sin contar modificaciones en nuestras redes neuronales (es decir, un modelo simplificado), eso explicaria por que la Law of Accelerated Returns es exponencial.

A: Creo que esta bueno que funcionemos como una GAN, compitiendo para refinar nuestra argumentación y conclusiones, que opinas?

S: interesante lo de que nuestras redes neuronales hayan sido afectadas. Yo creo que si de repente sacamos a todo lo que yo llamo soporte externo, el progreso se estancaría, por no tener un dataset grande para entrenar a los humanos. Como aprenden los bebés a leer? Además de escuchar a la gente, tienen libros. Como aprendieron Newton o Feynman de física? Seguro que también con libros.

S: Se me viene a la cabeza la importancia de la comunicación en el progreso. Como sería no poder comunicarnos? Esencialmente terrible. Existe una segunda dimensión en comunicación que no estamos utilizando actualmente que supondría un cambio enorme?

S: Qué te parece que yo siga hablando en inglés?? A mi me sirve bastante para el tema de practicar para las universidades.

S: cómo sería en la implementación ser una GAN? Cuáles serían los roles?

A: Con sacar el soporte externo, te referis a que desaparezcan todas las construcciones artificiales (desde libros a edificios o internet)? [Translating Ale Software...Update installed] If so, the information would be retrievable since someone created it in the first place, and thus it is stored in some mind. I won’t deny progress will slow down -- a lot. However, I argue humans won’t devolve (as in backwards evolution), but will rather figure something out and keep going. Essential information wouldn’t be destroyed in this scenario.
If you mean deleting every person’s memory alongside artificial structures, that’s the worst case scenario (and one I would rather not live in!). I still stand by my initial argument neural nets were permanently modified, which takes us to the next point. How did you delete the memories? Did you modify the neural nets to do it? Probably. Did you have to devolve neural nets to their prehistoric state?

A:  I would like to know your definition of communication. If we go by my personal definition, the absence of communication implies no sensorial stimuli is entering the brain. That is, a complete sensorial shutdown. If that’s the case, we would have things other than progress to worry about. Like die from hunger.

A: English is so cute. Here we go! I need to improve my speaking skills though, they are awful.

A: Generative Adversarial Networks are also cute (cuter than a bunny!). The general idea is that you have two ANNs “playing” against each other (game theory! Yay! This particular kind of game is called zero-sum game). One is the generator ANN, and the other is the discriminator. The “game” is as follows: The generator is fed with random noise, and its role is to, from that noise, generate an output to “trick” the discriminator. The discriminator takes two inputs: A real input and the generator’s output and its goal is to separate them, to discriminate between the fake data and the real data. So, the generator gradually becomes better at tricking the discriminator and the discriminator becomes better at distinguishing the generated data and the real one; until the system converges and there is insignificant difference between the two inputs fed at the discriminator: the generator became two good at its task and is now creating real data. Fascinating.
For us, it would work like this. One generates an argument and the other discriminates between the bullshit and the real. Then we reverse roles, and the other generates an improved argument (based on the bullshit he discovered) which will be evaluated by the now discriminator. Until the system converges and our arguments become extremely powerful. Basically, I try to find what could fail with what you said, propose an alternative approach; then you try to figure out what’s wrong with my approach and develop an improved one so the cycle continues.

S: Yeah, I agree with your first point (about artificial structure)

S: My definition of communication is the exchange between two humans beings. Using my definition, if you are alone in the world, you would have no communication. That takes us to the importance of the communication and being a social being. Many times I have listened that the human is a social being and that the learning is an emotional process. It seems like the best way to learn is through communication

S: The structure of a neural net on its own contains information. Therefore, if you want to remove the information, you need to delete it completely. If it has a structure, it has information. What happens if you shut down a human? (I mean a real shutdown, you disconnect the “power supply” of a human) I think that, at least partially, the human will lose information. Will it lose all the information? Which kind of information it will lose?

S: We can do something like this but spoken (in english) to practice the speaking part.

S: The GAN system is excellent! Some stuff to talk before implementing it:

(a) you said that the generator uses noise as input. Why noise? We have a lot of knowledge (real data) to feed us, so why not use that data?

(b) I think it’s important to select a good topic as a base of the cycle, otherwise we are gonna get really far in an unimportant field.

(c) although we have the bullshit argument generated by us, we don’t have a real argument to compare with the bullshit.

(d) in the GAN system, the generator is trying to maximize the credibility, but not the reality of the argument. Is better for the generator to make a plausible-sounding argument than a real argument. For instance, the generator would make use of logic fallacies. In conclusion, we should take care of going in the right path.

Importance of saying what anybody wants to say; as a individual and as a society.

Kids start their life making things that nobody cares about. People say children need to learn the basic skills to start creating. Yeah, they need those skills to produce stuff at the same level of that of the adults, but who said that building has to be productive?

I mean, people always say that school was boring. Why so many topics? No way I will feel like I can do great things if the main thing to optimize through childhood is the school.

Let’s imagine that a kid says “Yeah, I wanna do great work!”
What is this kid going to do? Try to optimize her scores at school!!!

And what happens next?
Next, she associates great work with boring things.

In fact, it seems that the unique way to do great work is to do things that you love.

I say: “I wanna do great work”. What comes next?

Many things are gonna prevent me from doing great work.  In general, those things are going to make our time of a less quality by forcing us to focus on other fields such as our Ego. Consequently, the hard-work will be reduced.

Family and friends
Even though we have a strong emotional link with them, they can prevent us from working on great things. Maybe they never work on great things, and, with good intentions, they teach us that working too much is bad.

It seems important to be around smart people, because you can't you

Ego
Doing great things and satisfying our ego are mutually exclusive. In fact, you can spend your time being or doing, but not both. Giving talks and interviews can make us focus on maximizing them and not

Distractions
When you need to do hard work, it is easier to be distracted.  Some people can work with some noise, whereas others can only work in silence.  Anyway, in most of the ways to hard-work, silence and concentration is needed.  Just one distraction can break half an hour of inspiration.

Socializing
We are social animals, and it can be extremely easy to forget to socialize.  Furthermore, if we don’t socialize, it will be difficult to socialize later on.  The importance of this point depends on the personality of the people, but, in general, some time dedicated to talking to others will benefit our productivity.  It helps to get a broader perspective of the world and to calm down our ego.

Sleeping
Sleep deprivation can have terrible effects on us.  It can affect both our mood and productivity.  The worst thing is that, when we are sleep deprived, we think that our feelings were always like that.

Eating
Being too hungry and being too full both drain out our concentration.  Just having a balanced diet will be good.  Something like four strong and two light meals is fine.

Exercising
It is unnatural to stay sit for the whole day.  Our bodies need some movement.  It can be walking, dancing, hiking, swimming, or other activity, but the point is to do it many times per week.  After doing some activity of these, we feel more energetic.

Nothing of all this advice will be useful if we don’t consider our own cases.  We need to listen and talking to ourselves.  We need to recognize our needs and desires.  We need to experiment and try new ways of improving us.

What things should we write to remember us? Like the essay of pg about the todo but general. What are the other things that we write to seem like we know or we are going to do something

Do we want to improve us, or do we want to believe that we are improving? Take the former. We want to get better through changes. If we aren't convinced whether some change is good, we will never do that modification in us. This can't be changed even if we remember us every day to do that change. In fact, we can obligate us to do something, but that, I think, is counterproductive.

When we wanna do a change, the best thing to do seems to be to evaluate the change. If we continue showing us a reminder that obligate us to do something, we are going to do that but without doubting whether is correct or not.

Thus, when we find us writing something to remember or obligate us, we can try to find which change we are looking to do and then try to think about it to determinate whether it’s a positive change, finally we can incorporate it.

I’m going to write a story, I will try to leave some life advice during the tale.

He was a very joyful person. He had a bunch of good friends and he had the freedom of a twelve-years-old kid, mainly because he had twelve years. This young kid was modest and happy. He was one of the best students in his class. Also, he was very curious and he was always asking how things work. It was the moment of the change, it was the very moment of the inflection point, when the change didn’t happen.

Why didn’t the change happen? Because of their parents. They didn’t help the kid.

The revolution Part I
What are we gonna do here? Nobody knows.

Just write, write and write.

Yeah, that’s a good topic.

Let’s talk about the business people and that stuff.

Why? Why do they seem so wrong? I mean, they are a lot of businessman and marketers. Are there plenty of people doing nothing in the world? Do this business really need to exist? Do they need to have business people working on it? Near my house I have two huge block towers full of people. Most of them are in suits. I’m pretty sure they are doing nothing. Those blocks are the “administrative” part of the company. Well, maybe they are doing something, but I think is nothing compared with the potential they have being, for example, scientists.

Some people are worried about the arrival of artificial intelligence and the following replacement of people at work. Right now, most of the people are doing fake work, I think. There are millions of lawyers around the world. Are they necessary? We do know that it is possible to make people think a field is important even though that field have nothing inside it. Take for example the marketing field. I have a subject about it, in which I have an unending book. I’m pretty sure that there is nothing important inside it. Nothing to squeeze. Nothing to apply in life. It is noise. I even listened to somebody saying “The marketing is important for this or that reason”. Bullshit, I thought.

Something similar happens with the TV, specifically with news programs. All the stuff they show is trash. Simply, it is noise. All those people look very serious, but, really, their work worths little. If I see a movie, for instance, I will get some interesting facts about life and human behavior. However, if I see a news program, I will get only worries.

Take now the case of Facebook, or even Whatsapp. They are social networks, right? Social. Networks. Social. Social. One can get easily the benefits from a social relationship from the comfort of one’s house or even when travelling in the bus. It seems very easy. This is related to the study mentioned in the video from Simon Sinek about millennials. In that video, he says that when people are depressed they tend to use more the social networks.

Instagram! Oh, my dear Instagram. Yesterday I used it. I used it because I wanted to see some images from Cata, I girl that I like. It’s really weird, just with two clicks, you can access to pictures of the boy/girl you like. That photos are pretty produced, and in some cases they are of some parts of the body that you will never see during a normal day. How, then, do we explain our brain that we need to put quite a lot of effort to get the same result that I have with two clicks? Yeah, big problem.

Why do people use Facebook? Maybe the question should be: why do people get distracted? Why aren’t people doing what they really like?

The answer seems really simple, they need to do things they don’t like to maintain their families. How does it work? Aren’t there a good distribution in which people could work of what they want? This maybe excesses my knowledge.

What we do know is that people see TV, use Whatsapp, or use Facebook most of the time. Therefore, it seems that the problem isn’t that they don’t have time but they don’t want, they don’t get encouraged by anybody.

The title is “The revolution” and we talk nothing about the revolution so far. What do I mean by the revolution?

You, you the people have the power.

Indeed, we have the power. Nobody is going to take our power. The power is ours.

How can we take the most of our power and make it real?

Why is it so bad? I mean, all the people know that the politicians are bad, that the education is awful and that most of the system are corrupt. Why does this happen? I think that the problem is related to what the TV did and what Facebook, Twitter and online newspapers are doing.

They are worrying us. They make us think we are doing things when we are really doing bad things to ourselves. Why do they are doing bad things to us and how can we fix it?

First, they are trying to maximize

---- we are not being objectively enough, I think. That happens because of yesterday I was very angry with the tv -----

----

Maybe Argentina isn’t as bad as everybody thinks. Maybe we are good or very bad and nobody knows.





Why are so many people seeing TV? Why are so many people using Facebook?

---------------------------
Most of the people say that they don’t have time. The majority of us are trying to do more things that what we can. That gives us unhappiness as we are not achieving what we want. I think it is a key characteristic to pay attention to the important activities.

The people who say that they can't do in other way the things they do because they become bored are great.

Talk about how thinking that the things that we want to happen should happen bring unhappiness

Talk about friendsnds
How important is to have friends? It is very important, I think.

When I was a kid, I had several friends. It’s interesting to see my changes in friends and the changes in the activities I do. Ivan and Bruno were the first best-friends of whom I remember. Then the group of Brian and Juani Caporal. As I was doing more “intellectual” activities I was changing of friends. I’m not sure when I became friend of Brian, but probably it was in fourth or fifth. In that years I was starting Olympics. Also, when I was doing Olympics and the admission course for ORT, I leave rugby. Maybe the environment was undesirable, maybe the friends weren’t the type of people I was looking for. Anyway, I leave rugby.

When I started ORT, I sit with Bruno, Fede and Teo. Fastly, I went to the table with Ryan, Baran and Joe. Within that table, in a matter of months I was sitting with Joe. I became friend of Dylan in the second year. In the middle of fourth I became friend of Migue.

I never had a good friend who is girl.

Why it seems so difficult to achieve things? Or why it seems even impossible?

We are in a very interconnected world, that means we are aware of the life of many people. In a day to day basis we are seeing the awards of other people and we see our lives and it seems like crap. Just open Instagram and you will see a large number of people in foreign countries and some perfect-looking faces. Why do I want to use Instagram so much? Why can't I resist to watch tv?

Here we have two things: (a) the seemingly importance of the TV (and others), and (b) how we see the others’ life compared to our’s.

We are going to think a little bit more about the (b). Recently I entered to some social networks. I said it was for research, but maybe it was irrational. I feel somewhat bad when using Facebook or Instagram, but isn’t something with the social networks. I don’t know, is difficult to explain.

---
Today I have had two problems: (a) in the todaro class, we were seeing the movie “Reality bites” and I feel bad, and (b) I feel sad and unhappy in the english class in Tribunales.

Firstly, let’s talk about the Todaro class. I was trying to focus on the activity I was doing. I was using Khan Academy. But the movie was distracting me. I lose a lot of time thinking in the dilemma of seeing the movie or studying. It wasn’t clear for me which option was the correct.

When I go to the bathroom to clean my hands, sometimes all of a sudden I feel like peeing. But, when I pee, I discovered that the feelings cheated me. Therefore, I developed a method to avoid this. Always that I go to a bathroom and I feel like peeing, I repeat to myself “If I didn’t feel like peeing outside the bathroom, then my feelings aren’t real”.

I think that the same can apply here. If when five minutes before the movie I don’t feel like seeing the movie, then when the movie begins, even though I feel like seeing the movie, I should repeat to myself “If I didn’t feel like seeing the movie five minutes ago, then my feeling aren’t real”.

I think we shouldn’t expect too much innovation or critical thinking of me during those situations. It’s really difficult to know that you are being fooled by those movies. The same applies with lots of things, for instance, social networks. When you are in, it’s very difficult to leave them.

The difficult situation here is that the movie or the TV isn’t self-imposed: I don’t decide to see the movie or to see the TV, but are other people like Dax or Todaro who imposed the movie in the environment I am. An advantage of this is the highly predictiveness of the occurrence of the situations. With Dax, for example, most of the dinners are going to be like this. In Todaro, most of the classes are going to be like this (It not only applies to the classes we see a movie, but the ones Todaro talks).

In conclusion, it can be useful to repeat us “the feelings I’m having aren’t real”. Also, I think it’s important to make the most to disconnect us from the class. We have several options to do this. We can leave the class, we can use headphones, we can use earphones, we can sit at the back of the class, we can read the final of the movie on Internet, we can do the most interesting things so we don’t need so many willpower.

Of the tasks that before doing them I don’t feel like doing and when doing them I feel like doing, are there tasks that after doing them I felt I took a correct decision doing them?

----------
time & todo
What about the todolists?
In the last two years, when I wanted to be productive and didn’t know what to do, I simply took some item from the todolist and, just for completing the task, I got dopamine. Also, when I did know what to do but didn’t want to do some hard work, I took one task from the list.


----

The approach we are going to have to deal with the days I don’t feel happy is the following: try to recognize the errors/problems of the day. Write a report of the errors and try to find a solution to them. Voila.

------

Instead of the daily log, I’m going to write the peaks and valleys of happiness and productivity. Therefore, I will record only the important things. Also, we can do a weekly log or something like that.

The daily log without too much details seems interesting…

I think that not being with the family at night, knowing what to do always, doing something relatively interesting and talking to girls via whatsapp were the key to happiness days ago. I think that it was the hard work I did, and that was because it was really clear what to do. Right now with toefl and sag isnt clear, maybe it isn't clear because I'm trying to avoid hard work

General
Additional Information
Special circumstances
Because of my family’s economy, I went to a small primary school (elementary and part of the middle school) which had a poor English level. Therefore, while most of my high school friends went to a primary school from 8:00 to 16:00 and spend their afternoons on English classes, I went only from 8:00 to 12:30 with brief English classes. Thus, when I started high school, I began with a low English level. However, I taught me English in the last four years (especially in the summers.) That was enough to achieve proficiency in all areas except speaking. That’s why I got a 106/120 overall in the TOEFL and 760/800 in the SAT Reading and Writing but a 22/30 in the TOEFL Speaking Section. I know this isn't problematic because I maintain fluid conversations with my friends in English without difficulties. But to be completely sure this isn’t going to be an issue in the following years, I'm dedicating a significant amount of time to get better at speaking. And I'll continue to do so in the following months.

Why are you drawn to the area(s) of study you indicated earlier in this application? If you are "undecided" or not sure which Brown concentrations match your interests, consider describing more generally the academic topics or modes of thought that engage you currently. (150 word limit)
I remember when I coded my first programming project. I was on holidays, and I convinced my family to return earlier so I could assist to my first hackathon. That project didn’t work very well. But it was my first step in building programming projects.

In the last four years, I’ve created more than 25 apps and websites. Regardless of the successes or failures, building those projects gave me something unique: a thirst for knowledge.

In my free time, I’m always learning about Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. Now, I’m taking some MOOCs and reading a book about Machine Learning and another about Human Evolution.

After learning a lot about Artificial Intelligence, a goal appeared: building a computerized brain.

A Computer Science (or Cognitive Neuroscience) degree in Brown could give me the knowledge foundations, research experience, and environment (both people and faculty) to continue learning and hopefully achieve my goal.

/*

Computer Science mixes “Computer” and “Science,” the two disciplines I love.

Since I was a child, I’m fascinated by computers. They’re the best tool to materialize ideas. When I started to code, I discovered that I could change everything at my pleasure.
For me, Science is the best tool to understand how things work and then make better versions of those things.

Also, studying Computer Science will help with my main goals: launching a tech startup and building a computerized brain.

Regarding the startup, having a solid foundation in CS and the environment from CS (both professors and students) will be quite useful.

Regarding the brain, having a deep understanding of computers and the research opportunities in the field will certainly help me. This goal also makes me interested in Cognitive Neuroscience.

I could spend all day programming. I feel my brain working different that in the day-to-day life.

Why Brown, and why the Brown Curriculum? 200
I first heard of Brown University from Esteban Safrachnik, a sophomore student at Brown. He attended the same high school than me, but he is two years older. He gave me the starting point to start examining Brown.

The Brown's program appeals to me because it's ample possibility of exploration. I read on Quora that after studying in Brown, you will forever expect to be engaged and interested in what you do. That’s what I’m looking for! Coming from a self-learning experience in programming, I know this way of learning matches me perfectly.

I also like the open curriculum because it attracts students that are more passionate about what they’re doing and want to learn for the sake of learning. When I’m learning something I love, I like to have long conversations with other people about the topic. And Brown’s environment encourages this.

Esteban also told me about the rigor of the classes and the world-class quality of the professors. He remarked the clarity of the professors' explanations. Both the precision and quality fascinate me because I'm always trying to get a deep and clear understanding of how things work. And I try to go beyond my knowledge boundaries.

Tell us where you have lived - and for how long - since you were born; whether you've always lived in the same place, or perhaps in a variety of places. (100 word limit)
I've lived my first six years in a small house in Buenos Aires. In 2006, I moved to a bigger house that had an advantage: a little room in the backyard. At first, it was full of useless stuff (paint pots, roof tiles) but little by little I took everything out of this room. Now, as a friend said, "it's my bunker." There I created my best projects and had my best ideas. Whenever a friend comes, the whiteboard and sheets of papers with formulas stuck on the wall are interesting and funny enough to forget about the little space.

We all exist within communities or groups of various sizes, origins, and purposes; pick one and tell us why it is important to you, and how it has shaped you. (100 word limit)

Caltech
What three experiences or activities have helped you explore your desire to study and possibly pursue a career in STEM? (200 words max)
First, when I started to code, at 12, I created a program that answered questions. If it didn’t know the answer, it would learn it by receiving feedback from the user. That meant that a computer, with enough training, could answer any question. It was amazing!
After that program, I learned about Artificial Intelligence. And with four friends, I made a research team. We’ve been investigating and creating our own algorithms. With everything we built, we wrote a research paper. Also, in this group, I have my favorite conversations: everybody proposes his ideas, and we build upon the knowledge of the other. It’s like thinking at 3x speed!

Secondly, I participate in several STEM olympiads since I was ten years. These olympiads modeled my way of thinking towards a scientific one. I love to tackle the hard problems that these olympiads give.

Third, I remember I convinced my family to return earlier from a holidays trip so that I could arrive at my first hackathon, which was organized by Creactivis, a social community I assist since I’m 13. There, I discovered the power of learning by doing projects. With friends from Creactivis, I developed websites and researched about Machine Learning.

Book 1: "Elon Musk: Inventing the Future" by Ashlee Vance
Influence
It gave me a role model and exciting insights about startups and learning. Understanding Musk's life helped me define that I want to make a significant impact on the world.

Book 2: "The Obstacle Is the Way: The Timeless Art of Turning Trials into Triumph" by Ryan Holiday
Influence
This book shifted my perspective on problems. Before reading it, I thought problems were something to avoid. Now, I recognized problems as an opportunity to grow and understand myself.

Book 3: "The Man Who Calculated" by Júlio César de Mello e Souza
Influence (200 char)
I read it when I was a kid. It’s about a man with exceptional skills in maths. This story showed me how interesting is to know a lot about something. It motivates me to never stop learning.

Members of the Caltech community live, learn, and work within an Honor System with one simple guideline; 'No member shall take unfair advantage of any other member of the Caltech community.' While seemingly simple, questions of ethics, honesty and integrity are sometimes puzzling. Share a difficult situation that has challenged you. What was your response, and how did you arrive at a solution? (200 word max)
“Imagine you are driving back to your house after buying a hamburger. It's night, and it's cold. In the middle of the trip, you come across a young kid starving.

Somehow, you know that if you don't give the hamburger to the kid, she will die. But if you do give it, she will survive and return with her family.


Wouldn't you give it to her?”

When I came up with this story, it puzzled me. Now, there are people starving that I could be supporting only by donating the money I used to buy my new t-shirt.

I don't have the full answer to this dilemma. But I know it influences me:


It reminds me to recognize everyone as a peer. I remember a conversation I had with Luis, a peddler that was selling cookies. After having talked for some minutes, I recognized that Luis was more intelligent and compassionate that several of my friends. I spoke with him for more than an hour. And he demonstrated me that honesty and integrity aren’t strongly correlated with money and reputation. Now, I try to judge people not by their status or appearance but by what they say and their behavior.



Caltech students have long been known for their quirky sense of humor, whether it be through planning creative pranks, building elaborate party sets, or even the year-long preparation that goes into our annual Ditch Day. Please describe an unusual way in which you have fun. (200 word max)
Regularly, I met four friends to research about the brain on Saturdays. Sometimes, we arrived at night very tired, after a complete day of work. During the day, we have talks being very rational. We are organized while talking, and the fluency of the conversation shows that we know each other since long ago. Some of our best ideas in the research project happened while talking.

But in the night, we just can't continue thinking at that level. And the best thing appears: whenever someone states a flawed argument, we shout "Logic Fallacy, Logic Fallacy." (With the beat of “Turn down for what”)

And this is the most normal part. After some hours, we can't even state arguments. When unconsciously everyone accepts this, we start to talk like salespeople. We use big words such as "disruptive technologies" or "unconventional merchandise." We have no idea about the real meaning of those words. But by how we use them, it seems like we know what we are talking about.

In the worst cases (and the funniest) we start using fun words such as "bumfuzzle" and “ranzoneta.” And we reach the point when we can't say a word without laughing for minutes.

In an increasingly global and interdependent society, there is a need for diversity in thought, background, and experience in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. How do you see yourself contributing to the diversity of Caltech's community? (200 word max)
I’m a programming tutor in Creactivis (social community). Lucca, one of my students, was quite shy the first time he came. Whenever I asked him something, he didn’t answer. After thinking hard, I discovered a technique that now I used with all my students: forget about myself and think what Lucca was thinking.
It worked: Lucca started to develop a 3D game, and when he leaves Creactivis, he always says “I can’t wait for the next class.” I also use this technique to explain difficult concepts to relatives and friends. And according to my grandma, it works perfectly!

Besides, it's remarked of Argentinian programmers that they know a lot about different areas. As we are in a third-world country, we have to build with what we have. For example, in the Physics Olympiad, we had to measure a pendulum’s period. But we didn't have the right materials. So, I ideated a new device, attaching a protractor to the pendulum with tape, using a column as the zero-reference, and tilting the apparatus with a rules' stack.

I think that by ideating ingenious ways of working and being useful to my peers and a good teammate, I could contribute to Caltech's community.


Scientific exploration clearly excites you. Beyond our 3:1 student-to-faculty ratio and our intense focus on research opportunities, how do you believe Caltech will best fuel your intellectual curiosity and help you meet your goals? (500 word max)
In my school, I get bored in classes where I'm not challenged. But when I'm challenged, my brain starts to work, and I begin to think about engaging questions and ideas (this mainly happens in the STEM classes.)
So, when I started my college research, Caltech's academic rigor and emphasis on STEM drew my attention. I think that a degree in Caltech is one of the best ways to stimulate my curiosity by setting high standards on what I can learn.
When I was a kid, I wanted to be a mathematician. This changed when I started to code, but I'm still very interested in math. Thus, I think that the stress that Caltech puts on math and theory fits me.
I like the Caltech’s “Honor Code.” I think it makes Caltech a healthy community and one that promotes collaboration over competition. That matches my way of work. I believe that collaboration is fundamental to achieve great things.
I have two main goals in my life. The first is building a Computerized Brain and the second is launching a startup.
Regarding building a Computerized Brain, Caltech is well-known for the solid foundations it gives in the sciences. The knowledge that I could acquire in Caltech would help me in having a good background to start researching about the brain. For me, people are a precious asset. And what I value the most of Caltech is its people. I read that Caltech’s students are always focusing on experiments and ideas that haven’t been done before. That matches perfectly with my aim to building a computerized brain! The Caltech’s community is one of the few that could give me the courage to tackle this goal.
As regards launching a startup, Caltech has an exceptional startup community. Indeed, it has one of the best ratios in the number of startups created per student (1 startup per 250 students.) I read on Caltech’s website that one thing that characterizes Caltech’s students is that they “are willing to swing for the fences.” That’s the main skill I look for in a co-founder!

I first heard of Columbia University from Salvador Moncayo, a freshman student in Columbia. He is one year older than me, and I met him in an international camp. He passed me his excitement when we talked about Columbia.

One of the things that I value the most about Columbia is its academic rigor and excellence. As Salvador told me, he is studying at a level never seen in his Argentinian school, and I love that. I like being challenged and going beyond my knowledge boundaries.

I have two main goals in my life: launching a startup and researching about Artificial Intelligence and the brain.

As regards researching about Artificial Intelligence, my main goal is to build a computerized brain. For doing this, I need a great deal of research experience. And Columbia research opportunities and connections with 200 research institutions undoubtedly could help me. Further, the best way to build a brain is through learning about different disciplines and mixing the knowledge. Therefore, the focus Columbia puts on interdisciplinary studies interests me. Also, the Columbia Core could be useful to see the topic from different perspectives. In Columbia's Engineering site I read about several students that besides their field of study, they met with opportunities related to other areas of study. This multidisciplinary is what I’m looking for.

Regarding launching a startup, it's excellent the importance Columbia gives to the entrepreneurship environment. It has several exciting clubs and labs such as the Columbia Entrepreneurs Organization and the Columbia Organization of Rising Entrepreneurs. Columbia has generated many successful entrepreneurs such as Ben Horwitz, one of my favorites entrepreneurs.

Cornell
Cornell Engineering celebrates innovative problem solving that helps people, communities…the world. Consider your ideas and aspirations and describe how a Cornell Engineering education would allow you to leverage technological problem-solving to improve the world we live in. (Please limit your response to 650 words.)
When I started to code, at 12, I created a program that answered questions. If it didn’t know the answer, it would learn it by receiving feedback from the user. That meant that a computer, with enough training, could answer any question. It was amazing! There, not only I discovered the power of Computer Science, but also a goal appeared: building a computerized brain.
To understand more about this topic, I started to learn about Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence: I took a course on Machine Learning and another on Computerized Neuroscience, I read papers, and I built programs. Studying this topic excites me. And attending Cornell University could stimulate me in this area. I always try to go beyond what I know. And Cornell’s academic rigor could push my knowledge boundaries. Also, Cornell has enough flexibility to give me a solid foundation in CS while also providing me with classes on different disciplines. That’s valuable because there are lots of fields that relate to the brain, such as Anthropology, Biology, or Psychology. Further, I value Cornell’s excellent faculties, with more than 40 Nobel prize winners affiliated. I certainly could learn a lot from them.
Besides, with four friends fascinated by Artificial Intelligence, I made a research team. In this group, I have my favorite conversations: everybody proposes his ideas about new algorithms, and we build upon the knowledge of the other. It’s like thinking at 3x speed! We’ve been investigating and creating our own algorithms. With all that we built, we wrote a research paper. But the opportunities I had to research were limited. However, Cornell is known for its numerous opportunities for undergraduates to conduct research. What interests me most about Cornell is that it has one of the leading Artificial Intelligence Research groups in the world. (Artificial Intelligence is the field that deals with intelligent machines, closely related to building a computerized brain.) I believe this research group could provide me the right environment, faculty, and opportunities to make my goal come true. I can see myself working on a research project there. It could be amazing! Also, I find exciting the cooperation between the different research groups in Cornell. Indeed, understanding the brain requires that collaboration from various disciplines.
In the last years, I participated in two educational startups; one was a tech workshop for kids and the other an app to make learning more engaging. The most exciting part was testing the app with real users and focusing on building something useful for them. My goal in the following years is to launch a startup solving some huge problem in the world. Regarding startups, Cornell has an excellent startup environment and is focused on giving its alumni exciting opportunities, such as Cornell Silicon Valley that connect alumni with industry innovators. Also, Cornell has the eLab (Cornell accelerator for student startups) which is characterized by its interdisciplinarity, something that fascinates me.
After thinking a lot about my goal of building a computerized brain, I reached the following conclusion: getting a computer with the same general intelligence than a human will be the most significant revolution in the history. And I'll do my best to be part of it. I know that to make a revolution I need knowledge and hard-work. For me, learning and researching at Cornell are one of the best ways to take advantage of my next four years. And if this revolution is achieved with responsibility, the world will improve dramatically: computers will be an extremely powerful tool for humans, probably enabling us to end poverty and cure the most terrible diseases.



Dartmouth
While arguing a Dartmouth-related case before the U.S. Supreme Court in 1818, Daniel Webster, Class of 1801, uttered this memorable line: ''It is, Sir…a small college. And yet, there are those who love it!'' As you seek admission to the Class of 2022, what aspects of the College’s program, community, or campus environment attract your interest?
The professor-student synergy is relevant for me, and Dartmouth is well-known for teachers who love their work and engage with their students. I even read about a program to take your professor to lunch. I admire that level of interaction! I also like the fact that Dartmouth is highly devoted to undergraduate teaching.

Coming from the experience of self-learning programming, I appreciate the freedom that the D-plan gives. Creating my calendar could give me the flexibility to pursue what I love.

Finally, the small size of Dartmouth could enable me to participate in research projects with prominent faculty members.

When I started to code, at 12, I created a program that learned from the user to answer questions. That meant that a computer, with enough training, could answer any question. It was amazing! There, not only I discovered how powerful Computer Science was, but also a goal appeared: building a computerized brain.

For this goal, I need a solid foundation in Engineering. Duke Engineering's approachable professors, small classes, and academic rigor makes the perfect environment for me.

Also, building a brain requires knowledge from several different fields, such as Anthropology and Biology. Thus, Duke’s focus on interdisciplinarity is what I was looking for.

I'd love to work at the Levine Science Research Center, the largest interdisciplinary lab in the US. For me, it seems like the Bell Labs of the 21st century. I see myself working there in the intersection between Computer Science and Cognitive Neuroscience.

(Optional) Duke University seeks a talented, engaged student body that embodies the wide range of human experience; we believe that the diversity of our students makes our community stronger. If you'd like to share a perspective you bring or experiences you've had to help us understand you better-perhaps related to a community you belong to or your family or cultural background-we encourage you to do so. Real people are reading your application, and we want to do our best to understand and appreciate the real people applying to Duke. (250 word limit)

Harvard
What specific plan do you have, if any, for using the education you hope to receive?
My two goals are building a computerized brain and launching a successful startup.
An education in Harvard will give me the research experience and knowledge foundations required for investigating the Brain later in my life. Also, it’ll provide me with the right people, ideas, and environment to start a business.

Your intellectual life may extend beyond the academic requirements of your particular school. Please use the space below to list additional intellectual activities that you have not mentioned or detailed elsewhere in your application. These could include, but are not limited to, supervised or self-directed projects not done as school work, training experiences, online courses not run by your school, or summer academic or research programs not described elsewhere.

Together with four friends, we developed MindLab, an app that made learning more engaging. After hundreds of hours of development, we went to the underground to advertise it. Explaining the app to strangers helped us in defining our mission.

Together with three friends, we developed Resúmenes, an educational suite to integrate technology in schools. It had collaborative documents, calendars, and messaging.

With my project to look for missing people, I participated in the Virtual Mind Incubator for 4 months. There, I received mentorship in design, programming, and business.

With the Creactivis workshop, I participated in the Y Combinator’s Startup School MOOC. Received one-on-one mentorship from Ritesh Patel, a successful entrepreneur from Silicon Valley.

I learned about web development in Creactivis, a project-based tech community where now I’m an organizer.

Informatics Olympiads training in my school (extracurricular activity). There, I learned about algorithms mainly related to graph theory (Dijkstra, Dynamic Programming.)

Princeton
If you are interested in pursuing a B.S.E. (Bachelor of Science in Engineering) degree, please write a 300-500 word essay describing why you are interested in studying engineering, any experiences in or exposure to engineering you have had, and how you think the programs in engineering offered at Princeton suit your particular interests.
When I started to code, at 12, I created a program that answered questions. If it didn’t know the answer, it would learn it by receiving feedback from the user. That meant that a computer, with enough training, could answer any question. It was amazing! There, not only I discovered the power of Computer Science, but also a goal appeared: building a computerized brain.

To understand more about this topic, I started to learn about Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence: I took a course on Machine Learning and another on Computerized Neuroscience, I read papers, and I built programs. Studying this topic excites me. And attending Princeton University could stimulate me in this area. I always try to go beyond what I know. And Princeton’s academic rigor could push my knowledge boundaries. Also, when I started to research about Princeton, I noticed that lots of student reviews agree that Princeton has a strong focus on undergraduates. I like that professors are approachable, enthusiastic about their students, and focused on giving clear lectures.

With four friends fascinated by Artificial Intelligence, I made a research team. In this group, I have my favorite conversations: everybody proposes his ideas about new algorithms, and we build upon the knowledge of the other. It’s like thinking at 3x speed! We’ve been investigating and creating our own algorithms. With all that we built, we wrote a research paper. But the opportunities I had to research were limited. However, I think this is different in Princeton. In a review by a student, I read that a Princeton faculty said, “we love working with undergraduates on research. In fact, sometimes we give undergraduates the strangest and most challenging problems.“ That’s excellent for me! Building a computerized brain is certainly challenging. Also, as making a brain requires views from different perspectives, I like the Princeton interdisciplinary approach to research. This is reinforced by the fact that Princeton Engineering brings together people from diverse backgrounds and academic disciplines.

Another experience I had in Engineering was the informatics olympiad. I participate in it since I was 13 years. In this Olympiad, I learned a lot about graph theory and programming in C++. So, my foundations in programming are quite theoretical. Therefore, I like Princeton’s focus on theory. I’m more interested in learning the fundamental principles of Computer Science than learning software engineering skills.

In the last years, I participated in two educational startups. The most exciting part was testing with real users and focusing on building something useful for them. Regarding startups, Princeton has a vibrant community passionate about building startups. I noticed that Princeton takes the startups seriously for The Keller Center startup incubators and the Entrepreneurship Club. In fact, the Entrepreneurship Club drew my attention for being one of the largest groups at Princeton.


In addition to the essay you have written for the Common Application, please write an essay of about 500 words (no more than 650 words and no fewer than 250 words). Using one of the themes below as a starting point, write about a person, event, or experience that helped you define one of your values or in some way changed how you approach the world. Please do not repeat, in full or in part, the essay you wrote for the Common Application.
1. Tell us about a person who has influenced you in a significant way.
[REFERENCE TO LUCCA - 650]

Please tell us how you have spent the last two summers (or vacations between school years), including any jobs you have held. (About 150 words)
Summer 2017: Besides meeting with friends and travelling to the Argentinean North with my family, I was dedicated full time to two educational projects. One was Creactivis, a tech community for kids. There, I taught programming to my students and made the workshop grew. The other project was MindLab, an app I developed with four friends to make learning more engaging. At the end of the summer, after producing a stable version, we tested it with real users: we went to the underground to advertise our app. It was a great experience because explaining what the app was helped us in defining our mission.

Summer 2016: I spent most of my summer in internships and camps (I won merit-scholarships for all of them).

I participated in the following trips:
- International Junior Science Olympiad (South Korea)
- Hebrew University of Jerusalem Internship (Israel)
- Biology ORT Summer School (Panamá)
- Bayer Kimlu Leadership and Science camp (Chile).

I had deep conversations about my life goals that changed the way I experience life. After those trips, I became more devoted to help people. I gained a deeper understanding of the world by visiting different cultures and talking with lots of people from around the world.

In both summers I worked as a freelance web developer and as the programming assistant in my mother's business.

Rice
With the understanding that the choice of academic school you indicated is not binding, explain why you are applying to that particular school of study. (150 word limit)
[REFERENCE TO AGI - 150]

How did you first learn about Rice University, and what motivated you to apply? (250 word limit)
I first learn about Rice University when I was volunteering in the EducationUSA WHA Regional Forum. There, I talked to a Rice's representative. After that conversation, I began to research more about Rice, and I found that it has remarkable attributes.

First, I value a lot the quality of the people. Particularly, I care about the professor-student synergy. When researching about Rice, I read a blog entry stating that Rice’s professors eat with their students to know them better. I love that level of engagement!

Secondly, the emphasis on inclusiveness that Rice has interests me. Being an international student from Argentina, I like the fact that Rice seeks for students with a diverse background.

Thirdly, I love to learn beyond my limits, and Rice's academic rigor excites me. Also, I care about the education quality, and the fact that most professors are the best in their fields is excellent. Some professors, such as Ankit Patel, are not only outstanding in Computer Science but also in other areas such as Neuroscience and Mathematics. One of my life's goal is to build a computerized brain, and I need knowledge from several fields to build it. Therefore, researching with those professors could be excellent.

Fourth, the unique focus that Rice puts on undergraduate teaching combined with the 5:1 faculty-student ratio make Rice great.

Fifth, the research opportunities that Rice offers are exciting. Particularly, programs like Century Scholars Program would give me the experience I need to continue researching on Artificial Intelligence.

The Committee on Admission is interested in getting to know each candidate as well as possible through the application process. The following essay questions are designed to demonstrate your writing skills and facilitate our full appreciation of your unique perspective. Please respond to each of the following prompts.

Stanford
What is the most significant challenge that society faces today? (50 word limit)
Knowing ourselves.

Often, we’re living other’s life, mixing how things are with how we wish they were. Thus, we end up being delusional and working on things we don’t really love. Knowing ourselves enables us to control the direction of our life and work on the things that matter.

----


Recognizing everyone as an equal.

Globalization distances us, making us living in a bubble and thinking we are special. That mindset brings wars and corruption. The truth is, everyone is a human and deserves to be treated as so. We should stop thinking about ourselves and care more about others.


/*
When we think we are better than others, bullying takes away compassion, corruption takes away justice, and fear takes away love.

Recognizing that everyone can do great work but it takes lots of effort. In our hyper-connected world, we only watch the achievements of others and never the hard work beneath. When we try to do great things and don't achieve results in the short-term, we surrender.

Not giving up fighthing the "tentaciones" of the instant gratification. Social networks, TV, and the Internet make us think that everything in life is easy, fun and require little effort.
Recognizing the others as equal.

How did you spend your last two summers? (50 word limit)
Summer 2017: Dedicated full-time to Creactivis (tech workshop). Had endless meetings with friends talking about applied philosophy. Family trip to Northern Argentina.

Summer 2016: Internship at Hebrew University (Israel), Biology Summer School (Panamá), International Junior Science Olympiad (South Korea). Understanding the cultures from different countries helped me redefine my personality.

What historical moment or event do you wish you could have witnessed? (50 word limit)
I’d have loved to work at Bell Labs in the late 20th century. I’d have learned from several of my idols, such as Feynman and Hamming. And I’d have taken part in the development of the C programming language, one of the most significant achievements in Computer Science.

What five words best describe you?
Half social entrepreneur.
Half scientific, curious about the brain.

When the choice is yours, what do you read, listen to, or watch? (50 word limit)
Besides building projects, I spend most of my time learning.
Books about: interesting people (“Isaac Newton,” “Elon Musk”), startups (“Lean Startup”), philosophy ("Meditations"), and psychology ("Mastermind," "Mindset").
Articles/papers: arxiv.org (scientific papers); paulgraham.com, samaltman.com (startup essays.)
Messaging with friends around the world. (I also enjoy calling them.)

Name one thing you are looking forward to experiencing at Stanford. (50 word limit)
I’d love to meet professor Andrew Ng. He's a pioneer in Artificial Intelligence and Education. His Machine Learning MOOC was my entrance door to Artificial Intelligence. I’d like to discuss with him about the future of computers and participate in his research team that applies Artificial Intelligence to Education.

Imagine you had an extra hour in the day — how would you spend that time? (50 word limit).
At night, I try to reflect on what I’ve done that day, remembering the deep conversations I had and my accomplishments and errors. Paradoxically, I often commit the error of staying reading a book or doing a project and forget about reflecting. That hour would help me reflect more.

The Stanford community is deeply curious and driven to learn in and out of the classroom. Reflect on an idea or experience that makes you genuinely excited about learning. (100 to 250 words)

Virtually all of Stanford's undergraduates live on campus. Write a note to your future roommate that reveals something about you or that will help your roommate -- and us -- know you better. (100 to 250 words)
Dear future roommate,
I'm sure you came across on the Internet with some of those articles saying something like "The 11 Things You Didn't Know about The Success of Mark Zuckerberg." Personally, I try to avoid these lists, but you know, sometimes procrastination wins the battle.

So, what better time than now to procrastinate a little bit and read "The 6 Most Weird Things about Santi"?
1) I follow a Japanese technique where everything in the room has its place. Yes, you'll see piles of clothes in random places. But the places will always be the same!
2) I'm always ready to help, but my methods are a little particular. I try not to do the work for my peers. Instead, I try to help them in learning to solve the problem. So I can help them in the long-term. It'll seem weird at first, but my grandma reports that it's pretty useful!
3) You should watch out for the ideas you propose me. Very likely, we end up building a big project together!
4) Usually, I don't see myself in the mirror, but my friends say that I'm constantly smiling :)
5) I'm more of an early bird than a night owl. But surprisingly, you’ll find me some nights staying awake: some ideas just can't wait!
6) I often go for walks, and they take between fifteen seconds and three hours. I'll be glad if you want to join me. We'll surely end up with some exciting ideas.

Tell us about something that is meaningful to you and why. (100 to 250 words)

1. Which aspects of Tufts’ curriculum or undergraduate experience prompt your application? In short: “Why Tufts or SMFA at Tufts?”
For me, the quality of people and student-professor synergy are essential. Tufts's professors are recognized for being approachable and exceptionally dedicated to their students.

One of my life-goals is to build a computerized brain. And one way to make it is by understanding the brain through different perspectives. Thus, the interdisciplinary approach to the study of Tufts Engineering considerably fits with my goal.

Also, I’d love to research in the following years. And the Machine Learning Group and its connection with the Human-Robot Interaction Lab caught my attention both for being focused on Artificial Intelligence and being multidisciplinary.

Pomona
I couldn’t decide between a fictional or a real location. So let’s talk about two locations: the kingdom of god (fictional) and a social community called Creactivis (real.)

“The kingdom of God is among the people.” Luke 17:21, The Bible.

I don’t believe in all-powerful gods. Instead, I believe that we, the people, have the power. The power isn't in one man but in the connection between them. When people got together is when the world biggest achievements happened. Indeed, you feel the power when you look at that person you love into his/her eyes.

However, some people can’t bear this. There are people suffering from bullying. There are people socially excluded. They aren’t enjoying the best delight of living: connecting with others.

This is part of my motivation to organize and teach in Creactivis, a social community I’ve gone as a student since 2013. Now, I’m the programming tutor for four energetic kids.

Lucca, one of my students, was quiet and shy the first time he came. Whenever I asked him something, he just didn’t answer. I tried talking about games and websites. None worked. And the situation was becoming tense.

Some minutes before completely losing Lucca’s attention, I discovered a technique that now I use with all my students: forget about myself and try to guess what Lucca was thinking and what he wanted.

After thinking for a while, I remembered that lots of kids like YouTube videos. Jackpot! He loves YouTube. We started talking about our favorite YouTubers. He became relaxed, and the talk got much more fluent. Apart from keeping the conversation, I was thinking hard about how he could learn something new from Creactivis.

Lucca had shown a passion for video games. I remember when he revealed me a folder in his notebook with all the video games he had. It was like his treasure! I told him he could develop video games like those he played. And he made one of the most amazing faces I’ve ever seen. Lucca was excited about learning. I taught him some basic programming concepts, and he understood quite good the ideas.

Thus, I put him together with three more students. Again, Lucca had some troubles when integrating with the group. For example, one day he left the table with his three friends and went to a desk outside Creactivis’s environment. When I found him, I saw him alone with his headphones and notebook. Certainly, integrating into a group was tough for Lucca. But the Creactivis’s climate and students’ warmness worked together to include him. Now, they form an excellent team. They started to develop a 3D game. And they created their own Skype group to play video games outside Creactivis.

At the end of his first class, Lucca was euphoric. And when his parents came, he proudly showed the work he’d done. Before leaving Creactivis, Lucca always tells me,

“I can't wait for the next class. During the week, I’m always waiting for Fridays to come to Creactivis!”

When Lucca’s mother comes to pick up him, she also makes an astonishing face, as if something magical was happening in Creactivis. And maybe it’s happening.

An acquaintance of Lucca later told me he suffers from Asperger Syndrome, a developmental disorder characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction. Immediately, I realized that Creactivis would be life-changing for Lucca and his peers. In this community, they find an inclusive space to share time with friends who have the same love and curiosity for video games and programming.

For this reason, I’m focused on expanding Creactivis. I’ve been leading the growth from ten to thirty students. And maybe, thanks to this fusion between the kingdom of god and Creactivis, more kids would receive the most wonderful opportunity of life: connecting with people.

PENNY the last jedi essay The last PERDI jajanoperdichauococococo oc Coco
How will you explore your intellectual and academic interests at the University of Pennsylvania? Please answer this question given the specific undergraduate school to which you are applying. (400-650 words)

*Students applying to Digital Media Design and Computer & Cognitive Science should address both the specialized program and single-degree choice in their response. For students applying to the other coordinated dual-degree and specialized programs, please answer this question in regards to your single-degree school choice; your interest in the coordinated dual-degree or specialized program may be addressed through the program-specific essay.

When I started to code, at 12, I created a program that answered questions. If it didn’t know the answer, it'd learn it by receiving feedback from the user. That meant that a computer, with enough training, could answer any question. It was amazing! There, not only I discovered how powerful Artificial Intelligence was, but also a goal appeared: building a computerized brain.

For this goal, I started to learn about Computer and Cognitive Science. I took courses in Machine Learning, Computational Neuroscience, and Psychology. I read books on Anthropology and about the memory. I read papers on Neuroevolution and Reinforcement Learning. I learned everything by myself because at my school I only had some classes on Computer Science and none on Cognitive Science. This could entirely change if I’m accepted at Penn. Indeed, it has something unique in comparison to other colleges: the dual-degree in Computer and Cognitive Science. I love that it combines the two fields that I’m most excited about! In fact, I believe that the intersection between those two areas contains the foundations to achieve my goal of building a computerized brain. Moreover, I care about the community. Being surrounded by students intrigued by Artificial Intelligence could be amazing. In a review I read, a student said that everybody in this dual-degree seems extremely happy.

Besides, to understand better our brain, I extract bits of knowledge from every situation. For example, I learned the power of imitation by observing how my baby cousin learns. (She's so cute while learning!) Thanks to these observations, sometimes a set of realizations pop into my head like a domino, and it’s excellent. Thus, I think that comprehending how the brain works is a multidisciplinary task. It's great that Penn encourages interdisciplinarity. For example, I like that Penn promotes students to take classes in all its schools. While most colleges have only two schools, Penn has four. I think this is, in part, what produces entrepreneurs like Elon Musk, one of my role-models.

With four friends fascinated by Artificial Intelligence, I made a research team. In this group, I have my favorite conversations: everybody proposes his ideas, and we build upon the knowledge of the other. It’s like thinking at 3x speed! We’ve been investigating and creating our own algorithms. With everything we developed, we wrote a research paper. However, we had limited opportunities to research. If accepted at Penn, this could radically change. Penn is a pioneer in Artificial Intelligence, and it has exceptional faculty such as Mitch Marcus. I’d like to research with Mitch. He’s an expert in Artificial Intelligence, he’s very exciting research going on, and his students estimate him a lot.

During high school, I participated in Informatics Olympiads and developed several programming projects. There, I discovered my admiration for computers. All these years of training made me strong in Engineering and Computer Science. That’s why my secondary school choice is Engineering. My single-degree choice is Computer Science because I think I’m better with CS and I could achieve more from this discipline. Also, in comparison with the Applied Science Program in Computer and Cognitive Science, I’m more interested in only CS. That happens because to have the foundations to achieve my goal, I believe I need a complete degree in CS. Further, I think that a BSE education matches me more than a BAS: I always liked more the technical and theoretical parts than the applied ones.

I think that building a computerized brain will be the most significant revolution in the history. And I’ll do my best to be part of this revolution. Just as Penn provided the right people, environment, and resources to get the ENIAC built and consequently start the Computer revolution, I believe that Penn could be the next best place to host the revolution of Artificial Intelligence.

And I'd love to contribute to it.

For example, I write essays the same way I write software: I sit down and blow out a lame version 1 as fast as I can type, then spend several weeks rewriting it.

Thomas Huxley said "Try to learn something about everything and everything about something."

Working on hard problems is not, by itself, enough. Social sciences is an example of this, they are working in big problems but with a wrong approach.

I was never opposed to reading something as much as 10 times until I squeezed everything out of it.

Advice for a teacher
http://www.paulgraham.com/raq.html
Students will test their teacher (e.g. doing little work, bad behaviour). They won’t respect teacher with low standards.
Good teachers like their students.
Good teachers love what their teach. Like boredom, enthusiasm is contagious.

How we should teach Science
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gstcvew6FVM
Great scientist see a problem, like chess players, and intuitively have a movement, an insight.
If you do the same thing many times, for example copying and pasting code, as the time pass you will slowly start to understand things.
You don’t want to overwhelm your consciousness because you finish doing nothing, but also you don’t want that your consciousness do no effort at all, because you’ll never learn, you need the consciousness to learn.
Now the problem is one of optimization, where between overwhelm and no effort is the best way to teach

Learning with a purpose is better
It seems obvious, but sometimes we can forget it. It makes little sense to read random article Wikipedia. If we have a purpose or some activity where we are going to apply the acquired knowledge, it's gonna be much better.

Feynman technique
We should have true understanding of what we are learning. We shouldn't care about the details if we don't know how the general things work. A food indicator of this is to try to explain others what we’ve just learned with our own words. So it's very important to take notes with our own words. We don't want to do that because it's difficult and that happens because it makes us think.

The Science of Thinking - Veritasium
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBVV8pch1dM
Learning is the process of building more and bigger chunks by storing and furthering connection information in long term memory.
When we read something that doesn’t make sense, the intuition can’t solve it and consciousness appears
If you really want to learn and get better on everything you have to be willing to be uncomfortable because thinking takes effort, it involves fighting to confusion.

I don’t know what to do, and I need to make decisions.

Those decisions were related to going to unis in the past.

Now they are related to meeting people.

You’re completly free. Now, however, we have no schedule. The idea is the following:
have defined in what I’d like to work. Roughly, it is:

Playing football
Writing
Try to do everything from unis in the next four days.

If I’m working on stuff related to (1), it doesn’t seem like I’d do things wrong.

What I do have to care is to have clear what to do. Have goals. If I don’t measure anything, I don’t produce anything. I should make the habit of, when starting to do something, know what I’m gonna do.

The only thing to do is to shutdown all devices after 21:00 and just read. Yeah. That’s seems good.

Errands is work. Get together a lot of errands.
Thinking/planning is work also. But take care of this. It’s optimizating, and I have to avoid optimizating when it’s premature.

Lunch-tea-dinner: think about what can I do here. Actitud > amount of time spend

Insecurities. I have lots of them. Why?

mmm. Let me ask a better question.

What’s the origin of all those insecurities?

Let’s talk a little more about them. Do you remember when the guy from CNBA told me that Zoe was deeply in love with me? Yeah. The feeling of somebody loving me was something I couldn’t dimensionate. Do you remember when mom talked about what she felt when Lucho Calcero was admiring Javi?

This is my therapy.

I made an error. I said “la chica ocupada” to Julia M. This is similar to the error I made of chafing with Julia the waiter on the Bowling. I was nervous. I didn’t know what the hell do. And I was afraid of that. I think I made those errors because of insecurities, because of thinking that people don’t like me. That people are joking with me. That people (others than my close family) can’t love me.

The problem with Julia C and the bowling wasn’t that I didn’t have a clue about the topic. The problem was that I didn't have a clue about the topic and I cared about it. Generally, the problem isn’t uncertainty. The problem is that we start the loop from hell based on something irrelevant. Not knowing what to do isn’t a problem. As a lower bound, it’s the reality. And what’s happening is that you are doing difficult things and you are leaving your comfort zone. And that’s fucking excellent. Just trying and failing is better than no trying.

So, no to mistreat people. Yes to recognize that I have insecurities and address them. Yes to recognize the uncertainty of life and being comfortable with it.

I should recognize who I am. I should know myself. Through writing, thinking, and walking.

Why do I think that people don’t love me if I know that it’s otherwise?

Are there people that love me?

Zoe. Take the lovely letters. Joe, Dylan, Alejo, Clari, Julia.

Do I love them? Why it’s so difficult for me to demonstrate them my love (both physically and verbally)?

I recognize they are great people.



Being other doesn’t work in the long-term, and I end up doing shitty stuff like sending the message “la chica ocupada” to Julia M. Maybe she didn’t notice this. But I did notice. I did notice that I mistreated her. And that isn’t me. Be yourself, in the sense of not trying to seem ruder in wpp conversations or lying in common app.

Not being yourself seems powerful in the long term. But take care. It’s a trap! If I am not myself, I will end up with shit everywhere. Shit in what others believe about me. We are lying others. Shit in what I believe about me. I’m lying myself. And not being myself wastes a great deal of energy.

The problem is about me. If I write something saying other thing that what it really is, I will end up believing that. Surely the story about Lucca now is full of shit in my head. And that’s so bad. Because now my goals are full of shit. It isn’t that I’m becoming the person I say to be. That would be so easier! If that was the reality, just with saying stuff like “We should play Age of Mythology more often” this would work. Or, more drastically put, “I should be more like Elon Musk.” This has no value. “I should be more honest.” What the hell am I supposed to do with that string of chars? After lying for some time, the liar starts to think that being we can achieve a characteristic just by saying “I have X attribute.” And that’s so bad! In this way, the liar forgets about the hard-work beneath the goals.

Why do I continue lying and trying to be other person?
Maybe I don’t believe enough in myself.

Why don’t I believe enough in myself?
The rejection I felt from Joe when I sit with him in secondth.
The media explosion when I was in third maybe influenced me in starting to be insecure.
The rejection I felt from Joe when I wasn’t accepted in Diamond Team.
The rejection I felt from Joe when Migue, Joe, Dylan, and Ryan were in a group.
The rejection I felt from Mati for “selecting” Joe.
The impotence I felt with girls.
The toxic relationship with Migue.
Mom’s education.

(This lack of confidence produced things like leaving GL, Chona et al, believing in others’ opinions [particularly, joe’s])

About the rejections in general: it was less personal than what I believe. And maybe Dylan and Migue had a reason to reject my proposal of joining Diamond. I mistreated them.

About Joe: this is a big deal. Why do I suffer that much in the relationship with Joe? Why don’t I leave the relationship?

If I hadn’t gone to all those trips in 2016 (including the retreat), maybe I would have converted into something like Gino Tubaro. Canin surely had some effect here.

Hell, the story of my life shows me how I’m very very hard-worker, but I spent my time on useless stuff. (SAT, univ, late pp, late smartacc.) So there you have the value of thinking, walking, and writing.


My core is competition. I should write some other essay addressing competition. But let’s look at the gist of the problem.

Why am I competitive?
Maybe dax passed me some of his competition.
Going to San Ladislao can explain some stuff. I was in a competitive environment. Competition can be defined as the desire of being better than others. Valedictorian, best friend, writing contest. Yeah, the situation was just one part of the process. The other part was my mentality.

What started my competitive mentality?
Since I’m a child I’m competitive in playing football.

To BE continued

What I did bad
I had no confidence in myself.
I took decisions based on what others were doing instead of what it would had added more value to me.
I was excluded from Diamond and that hurted me.

What I’m gonna change
Do what I love - programming, thinking, reading, being with people, building ideas, playing football - no more of postponing.
Be 100% honest. No place for lying.
Do what adds more value at any given moment.
Know myself, think about me.
Limit univ stuff to a 25% of my time.
Limit self-improvement ot a 25% of my time.
Get rid of distractions. Arrange everything to work with silence and in calm.
Think think think. Walk walk walk.
No more of suboptimal stuff. You can do great things, but that’s only achievable when you do what you love at that moment. That’s why it feels bad to date a girl that I loved and not that I love right now. Suboptimal stuff feels extremely bad when you are aware of it. (remember thinking about Luchi in the National OMA.) Why in the world are you doing something suboptimal my dear? FEARS and PRESTIGE and NOT THINKING FOR YOURSELF and FOLLOWING WHAT OTHER THINK and NO HAVING CONFIDENCE IN YOURSELF and NOT GOING ALL THE WAY. Well, that was maybe too much.
So, let me state this question again and center it.

Why in the world are you doing something suboptimal?
(this is similar to: is this the best thing you can be doing?)

Maybe you are dreaming about that “success” of Mark Zuckerberg.

How can we decide whether something is suboptimal or not?

My goal is going all the way in doing what I love. So an action is better than other if it makes me do more of what I love in the long run.

Spending a year in doing something I don’t love is a big deal.


What about the next days?

30,31,1,2: 33% University stuff. 33% being with family (30,31). 33% reading Sapiens, writing “A simple description of language and oratory,” building NN, (30,31) Then, 50%, 50%

Nico: conoces el problema de la induccion? Es un problema bastante importante dentro de la epistemologia, que es una rama de la filosofia que estudia el conocimiento cientifico. Dice que la induccion (fuera de la matematica) no es un razonamiento valido. Por que? Eso es por que basandote en muy pocos casos particulares ya asumiste que todo universalmente como pensas. Y ademas, como vemos y pensamos al mundo esta influenciado previamente por ideas y teorias, que no nos permiten una observacion completamente pura e inmaculada. Asi, nuestras observaciones no son plenamente datos del mundo, de la realidas, son ademas teorias y analisis previos, y experiencias, y hasta tal vez influenciadas por nuestros sentimientos.
El tema esta en que cada vez que postulamos una ley general lo hacemos de hecho por induccion, que fuera de la matematica, como vemos, no garantiza nada. Y luego... como es que vale lo que decimos?

Nico: Hay una postura, que sostuvo Karl Popper, que es que hay que sostener provisionalmente lo que tenemos hasta que nos demos cuenta que esta mal y construyamos otro nuevo sistema de teorias, otro modelo para entender el mundo. Pero este tambien tiene problemas.
Asi, el problema de encontrar un metodo que nos lleve al conocimiento es todavia vigente sin ninguna solucion aparente. Es muy loco eso.

Santi: Cuando decís que tiramos el modelo anterior y construimos un nuevo modelo, sería manteniendo reglas como la lógica y la inducción y tirando cosas construidas a partir de cosas como la lógica y la inducción ? O “tirar el modelo anterior” también significa tirar la matemática (lógica, inducción, etc)?

Nico: Estaba hablando más de ciencias empíricas, como las naturales (fisica, biologia, quimica, etc.) o sociales (historia, filosofia, sociologia, psicologia, etc.) pero especialmente las naturales.
Cuando se descubrió que el modelo de Newton de la mecánica clasica no era del todo exacto, se lo pudo reemplazar por el modelo superador de Einstein y la relatividad, como ejemplo.

Santi: Claro.



[8:25 AM, 4/24/2018] Nico Agote: Eso es un resumen de IPC; a mi me parecio interesante, si te copo tal vez te pueda pasar unos resumenes en papel de los argumentos de cada pensador y demas.

Santi: Dale. Que pensadores vieron?

Nico: Inductivismo, versiones mas debiles de inductivismo, falsacionismo (Karl Popper), versiones mas debiles de falsacionismo, Thomas Kuhn, Imre Lakatos, y Feyerabend.

Santi: si tenés cosas de inductivismo, me coparía leerlas! :)

Nico: Uhh… los cuadernillos me los presto un amigo, y se los devolví. Pero tengo mis apuntes y resúmenes. Te voy a pasar los libros si los encuentro en PDFs, y si queres cuando nos vemos te doy resumenes.


[8:26 AM, 4/24/2018] Nico Agote: Te decia esto porque la persona que sepa predecir donde cae la pelota de Rugby lo hizo necesariamente por induccion. Pero la induccion no le garantiza nada. Luego, es eso conocimiento?

Santi: Le garantiza cierto grado de garantía, me parece. Podés decir que tiene cierta certeza de que la pelota va a seguir lo que el espera que vaya a pasar. Sería como decir: el resultado del experimento es 5 +/- 1 con un 90% de seguridad. Si eso no es conocimiento, que es lo que sería el conocimiento?

Nico: El tema es que la cantidad de casos en que puede caer una pelota de rugby es en principio infinita, o por lo menos demasiado grande para cualquier persona (pensa en todos los momentos del tiempo y del espacio en que caiga y pique una pelota de rugby). Luego que haya pasado en 5000 casos te dice poco si son prácticamente infinitos, y así en realidad no tenes ese 90% de chances, sino algo que tiende a 0. Tus casos en que salió bien, sobre los casos totales (muchísimos) es un número muy chiquitito.
El problema de todo esto es que todos esos tipos no se deciden en un método válido para llegar al conocimiento de la verdad, y luego no te aseguran que la conozcas, ni que necesariamente lo que sepas valga para el siguiente caso. Honestamente eso es un gran pregunta, y me encantaría poder darte una respuesta superadora, pero estoy pensando sin demasiado éxito. En la práctica, te la doy que lo que decis es el “conocimiento”.
Todo esto es parte de los problemas de la inducción fuera de la matemática.

Santi: me parece que no coincido con el primer párrafo (desde “El” hasta “chiquito.”) Imaginate que tenés un generador de números random del cual no tenés información. Recién corrí un programita que hace el promedio de 5000 de esos números random entre 0 y 1 y calculé el promedio. Ese promedio me dio 0.50024. También corrí un programa que corre 5000 casos del número random y agarra el mínimo de los 5000 (me dio 0.0002.) Y el maximo me dio 0.9999. Ahora, con esa información te puedo predecir con un 99% de seguridad los rangos de cualquier generador de números random del cual no tengas información. Lo que acepto es que nunca vas a estar 100% seguro. Pero, para vos acá no tengo información de como se van a comportar los infinitos casos?

Nico: De por sí, como es un programa de computación, ya tiene que ser una lista ordenada de pasos. No te asegura que puedas volver para atrás, pero en teoría te da mas info sobre donde vas a caer, no? Además como ejemplo se toca demasiado con la matemática, en donde la inducción de hecho funciona perfectamente, algo formalizada.
De todas formas, en la práctica lo que tomamos por conocimiento es eso. Ahora, los epistemólogos se están preguntando qué es el conocimiento científico, y es natural que busquen los casos límites para una pregunta tan amplia. Y el caso límite, o lo que presuponen las leyes naturales, es que funcionan para todos los casos. Y no es que en casos como ese descubrimos/inventamos una ley natural a partir de nuestra experiencia? Pero son los pocos casos que conocemos los suficientes para garantizar que siempre fue, es y va a ser asi, como pretende una ley? Esas son las preguntas de los epistemólogos, y de hecho entienden que en la práctica podamos pensar así de todas formas. Lo único que dicen, es que no es del todo fiable defender eso como método para llegar al conocimiento científico.







[8:30 AM, 4/24/2018] Nico Agote: No lo se. Tal vez uno de los peores problemas de decir que hay una Verdad es decir especificamente que es.
Tal vez por como lo dijo, puede ser que se refiera a una "Teoria del todo", por ejemplo, como buscan los fisicos hoy en dia... la ecuacion que conecte todas las fuerzas fisicas, y la explicacion de como estan hechas todas las cosas materiales a partir del principio material primero (hoy en dia postulan las cuerdas)

Santi: Claro.




[8:34 AM, 4/24/2018] Nico Agote: Me da la sensacion de que nuestra interioridad, y nuestra capacidad de pensar, puede ser necesaria para entender la libertad.

Santi: Pienso que podríamos entender la libertad sin vivirla.

Nico: Lo decía como mi intro al resto del argumento. De todas formas, me parece interesante que plantees eso. Como dirias que entenderíamos la libertad así?
Santi: a lo que me refería es que “entender la libertad” no implica estar viviendola. Por ejemplo, podemos entender como funciona una hormiga (y no somos una hormiga.)
Nico: Claro



Nico: Asi, no solo hay que tener en cuenta al ambiente y la experiencia sino que tambien a nuestra condicion de seres pensantes.

Santi: Claro. Mi pregunta es: cómo esa condición de seres pensantes puede ser autonoma? Si se basa en el pasado, fallaría por lo que dije antes. Entonces para ser autonoma no solo se basa en el pasado. Hay algo más. Que pensás que sería ese “algo más” que hay?

Nico: Es una buena pregunta, y me encantaria poder responderla, pero no creo que pueda. El ejemplo que seguia era para poner algo parecido como ejemplo concreto de lo dificil que es encontrar esa pieza que falta. Para explicar esa libertad muchos sugirieron un alma inmaterial, y la defendieron en cada caso. Por mi parte, mas que eso no te puedo decir.




Nico: El argumento que me tienta mas y conozco es este: si pensamos, vemos distintas acciones posibles e intuimos sus resultados. Pero si al final de hecho actuamos y optamos por una y descartamos las demas, es que esto no fue autodeterminarse, y ser libres en sentido minimo?

Santi: me parece que el “intuimos sus resultados” está dado por nuestro modelo del mundo. Y ese modelo del mundo es información y nada más en principio. El “vemos distintas acciones posibles” pienso que también está dado por el ambiente. Puede ser que tu versión de vos en el pasado influya a tus acciones en el presente. Pero en algún momento naciste. oops. Estoy aplicando inducción. De qué forma podría ser que falle la inducción acá?

Nico: De vuelta, si es todo materia y reglas físicas entonces ni vale la pena ver la inducción, en realidad pensar es reacciones quimicas y fisicas y de hecho es como un sistema super complicado en el que en cualquier punto voy a poder predecir qué pasa en el siguiente.
El tema es que si asumimos que se puede autodeterminarse, el momento cero no es ningún problema: haces algo sin saber muy bien lo que va a causar, pero estuvo en vos haberlo hecho. Después con el tiempo vas puliendo lo que eligis, y así siguiendo vas logrando elecciones que intuis te acercan al fin que queres lograr.
De nuevo, si no agregamos ese condimento extra tu argumento es bueno, segun lo veo.

Santi: (voy a seguir pensando esto)






[8:39 AM, 4/24/2018] Nico Agote: Pero ademas hay que tener en cuenta otros problemas... si es que esto es un todo ordenado, hay una Verdad, es que cabe la posibilidad de que seamos libres?
Si es todo materia, y es todo ordenado, todo se resume a leyes fisicas y quimicas y biologicas, con lo cual nuestras elecciones tambien, y no dependen de nosotros, sino de ellas, y no hay libertad.
O sino, si hubiese libertad... como se mantiene el orden? Es parecido en mi cabeza al problema que tienen uds. los computologos pars para generar un numero al azar. El proceso para elegirlo es una lista ordenada de pasos, y luego, fue realmente ese numero elegido al azar? Y similarmente, en un mundo ordenado, como explicar la libertad?
Si hubiese cosas mas alla de la materia, cosas inmateriales, ya no se muy bien como encarar una respuesta.

Santi: interesante esto. Mi intuición me dice que es todo leyes físicas. Pero ese es el caso fácil. Veamos el otro caso. Supongamos que hay algo que no entendemos, algo que no parezca muy intuitivo. Vos preguntás “como se mantiene el orden?” con eso funcionando. Yo te pregunto “porqué debería haber un orden?”

Nico: Si pretendes explicar el Universo de alguna forma, y que esa explicación de hecho se condiga con el Universo, no es necesario que esté ordenado? Y si no lo está, tiene sentido plantear cosas como verdad, explicacion, libertad o no libertad, ciencia, etc.? Realmente todo seria azar, y no habría nada que predecir.

Santi: creo que estoy flasheando/delirando, pero podría ser que el orden que vemos en las ciencias sea una especie de ilusión. También puede cierta parte del universo se comporte azarosamente y cierta otra no. Coincido con lo que decís.

Nico: Sería interesante ver si se pueden sostener orden y azar a la vez. Me quedaría pensar si se puede, porque es algo que mucho no me plantee.

[8:41 AM, 4/24/2018] Nico Agote: Había entendido mal lo que querias decir, perdona. De todas formas, medio tramposo 2,5 jajajajaja.

Santi: jajajajaj. creo que también vale con A := 3 y B := 1 con la regla de que A sea mayor estricto a B (puse los := solo para tirar facha :)

Nico: Luego 3-1-1-1=0.
El tema es que si me decis dos numeros positivos cualquieras dentro de los reales, yo elijo el contraejemplo para cagarte. Luego elegir a y b y restarle a a el numero b (a/b) veces deberia dar exactamente 0. Si es verdad que en muchisimos casos eso que decis pasa, pero no en todos.

Santi: oops. Lo expliqué mal. Lo que digo es que la operación que haces es A := A - B. Es decir, A pasa a ser A - B. Por ejemplo, en el “3-1-1-1=0” cuando hacés el último -1 estás haciendo 1-1 y no es válido.

La paradoja que tal vez queres mencionar es que de hecho si sumamos:
1 + ½ + ¼ + ⅛ + … de hecho nunca llegamos a 2, pero si la consideramos una suma infinita decimos que es dos. Asi, para aplaudir, si empiezo con las dos manos separadas por 2 unidades de distancia, para recorrerlas primero tienen que recorrer mitad del camino y quedar a una unidad de distancia. Y despues tienen que recorrer mitad de lo que queda y llegar a media. Y asi sucesivamente, y vemos que nunca van a quedar a 0. Pero el aplauso se escucha, asi que de hecho recorrieron las 2 unidades, aunque recorrieron infinitas mitades de camino.

Santi: apa. no la había tenido en cuenta a esta.


[8:49 AM, 4/24/2018] Nico Agote: De toda esta linea de razonamiento, no sabria bien como responderte, no porque no entendi la pregunta pero porque es realmente dificil, segun me parece. A mi me gusta mas, e intuitivamente prefiero, la linea en la cual hay un Modelo ideal al que tendemos, luego hay una sola forma de realmente explicar a la realidad, en correspondencia con la Verdad. Asi, mi postuta diria que me gustaria que haya un solo grupo de "axiomas", y creo que eso te responde tu pregunta. Sin embargo, si planteas la Verdad Empirica Ideal como un axioma, por lo que dijo Godel es imposible que explique todo, porque necesariamente va a haber alguna afirmacion que no sepa decir si es verdadera o falsa. Por eso no se si lo definiria en ese cado como un unico axioma, o si es algo mas fuerte, y distinto del axioma.
El tema esta en que psra responder la pregunta de si podrian existir dos modelos no contradictorios en si mismods que expliquen toda la realidad habria que tomar dos modelos: uno  podria llegar a ser el cientifico, pero el otro tal vez deberia ser uno no cientifico (y no conozco demasiado modelos asi). Y hasta si fuese posible, podriamos tomar tal vez dos modelos sin que ninguno sea el cientifico y que cumplan lo que les pedimos.

Santi: que pasa si aplicamos godel a un sistema de n axiomas? Sería algo así:

“Esta es una sentencia que no se puede concluir a partir de ningún sistema de axiomas”
Supongamos que se puede concluir a partir de un sistema. Entonces la sentencia es falsa. Entonces un sistema dice falsedades.
Supongamos que no se puede concluir a partir de ningún sistema. Entonces la sentencia es verdadera. Entonces hay una verdad que ningún sistema tiene.

Que te parece?

Nico: Lo que dice Godel es que hay afirmaciones que simplemente no podes decir ni que sean necesariamente verdaderas, ni que sean falsas.
A mi entender, lo que probó es esto: tengo un sistema de axiomas, sin pedirle nada al sistema. Luego, siempre va a haber una proposición no verificable dentro del sistema de axiomas, o sea, no se sabe si es verdad o es falsa.
Supongamos que la incorporamos al sistema de axiomas, como verdadera o como falsa (en ambos casos pasa lo mismo). Ahora tenemos un sistema de axiomas. Y luego podemos encontrar una proposición que no sabemos si es verdadera o falsa… y así sucesivamente.
Lo que probó es entonces, que siempre va a existir esa proposición que no sabemos si es verdad o falsa, y entonces nuestros axiomas no van a estar completos.
Dicho esto (igual estamos hablando de algo que ninguno de los dos entiende, no se cuan productivo puede ser), probar un para todo con un sistema de axiomas debe ser super dificil. No se, es interesante pero algo no me cierra.

Santi: que sería lo que querés probar? no entendí bien a que te referís con “probar un para todo con un sistema de axiomas.” Creo que con lo que puse arriba con los bullet points, sin tener que invocar a Godel ni a ningun dios matemático, se demuestra que o bien ningún conjunto de n sistemas de axiomas es completo (ie, hay verdades que no están) o bien algun sistema de axiomas del conjunto de n sistemas tiene contradicciones (ie, hay falsedades en el sistema.)

Nico: Me gustaria saber mas de como funcionan para poder terminar de responderte. Tu argumento no parece poco convincente, pero bueno, creo me falta contexto para poder aceptarlo o rechazarlo. De todas formas, quedara para que lo piense mas.




[8:50 AM, 4/24/2018] Nico Agote: Perdona la longitud de los textos (mas que nada por si queres hablar de otra cosa), sos libre de decirmelo, y cambiar de tema

Santi: me copa así como está!!!


Sobre la inseguridad: I think that people don't like me enough. I can't conceive that someone could be in love with me. When a guy told me that a girl was strongly in love with me, I said/feel something like, "oh this never happened to me. I was never secure about something loving me." And after listening that from this guy I approached the girl and then kissed her and all that stuff. She didn't show me more love than any other girl. In fact, I'd never have thought that she liked me if this guy hadn't told me that.

How can a girl love _me_? I think. The reality is there were lots that did. Indeed, when I did not extremely bad (via whatsapp or Vale's case) it worked like a charm.

"The thing of approaching the girl is extremely easy" I think. And that's what makes me feel unhappy.

My process of thought is, "if it's that easy, why am I so bad at it?" who said you are bad at it?

How do you know it's so easy?

I don't think it's so easy. Lots of people only went out with 2 - 3 people. Actually, I don't think it's important to consider what others think. Let's think about me.

I met a billion times with Julia and I did nothing. Different days; different mentalities. Nonetheless, I couldn't get anything. It isn't that it's one trick and that's all. When I did things to approach Julia, Clari, or Zoe, I applied a lot of effort. With Julia, I desired that she wasn't there.

The thing to consider is why I want to be with girls. If it's all about kisses recognize that.

Whatever you want, we could try hard to do it. And although I’m gonna suffer at some time, it wouldn’t be a waste of time. And as it’s something I decide to work on, working on that wouldn’t be that bad. After all, I decided to work on that. And at least I learn from that.

Really, it isn’t that difficult. But why do I want to do it?

What if I tell you that it’s because it makes me feel good?

Perfect. Great. Excellent.

I said, “being in the bed with Clari makes me feel secure.”

Hey. There’s a difference between secure and good. There’s a great difference there.

(there isn’t so many things I’d like to do now. Girls/Football/Startup/Brain/Learn/Writing. Of course, there are other interesting things like travelling. But I don’t care about them too much)

Okay. I’m sure that some part of being with girls is like admiring the nature. I almost can’t explain what I feel when I see a girl into her eyes. Looking into the eyes to Cata or Luchi was extremely powerful. A caress it’s so great.

But, take care. This is mixed with my feeling of insecurity.

So you say it’s easy, how do you know?

Probably most of the girls are doing nothing. Analyzing all the past and how I “succeed” will tell me how to continue doing it.

I also shouldn't consider that it’s one step more and I’m done. This will never be the case. It’s like a continuum. More generally, I think we are too centered in a small part of this continuum, and we think that it’s one step more and we finish. The reality is, now I couldn’t say to Delfi what I felt. Some time ago, I couldn’t say anything with sense to Ivi or I couldn’t say to a girl what I feel when I was alone with her. Now maybe it’s easier to say what I feel to a girl if we are alone. Today I struggle with talking with the girl when we are in groups. There's always gonna be some next step. And if I’m thinking that this is all, that this is the step and the next is the finish, I’m never gonna enjoy the present moment. And it turns out that the reality is quite enjoyable. Quite enjoyable. I can take my phone, tell to a girl to go out, and we are gonna have a great great great conversation. So, there is not a next step that it will make life more enjoyable. Life is enjoyable now. If I’d like I can go to cordoba and see clari. If I’d like I’d talk to zoe and go out with her. Now, I don’t have 0. And in the future, I’m not gonna have infinite. Now I have 100 and tomorrow I can achieve 101. But who cares about that?


---
So the solution to suffering was that “the solution” didn’t exist. Suffering is something normal.







Box 1: Why why
The questions of “Why do I do X?” are extremely difficult to answer. Why?

This is an easy “why” question :). I think that answering them could generate an considerable change in my life. And also it could show that I was doing things extremely bad. The reality is, I’m always making things extremely bad. So it would be extremely bad to think that everything is going alright. Indeed, things would never be extremely right. If everything seems okay, chances are I’m not seeing that they are really bad.

That what I do is really bad isn’t a problem per se. The problem is that I feel bad at doing things extremely bad.

It’s so good to feel bad!!! If I weren’t feeling that bad, I would be doing suboptimal things.

Maybe answering the why’s is so difficult because it could change my life.


-------------------------

Really Santi, why do you want to meet girls?

Mmm. I think I can get interesting insights with the following question:
Why did I want to meet girls?
Why did I want to meet Cande?

I don’t know, Santi. She was pretty. That’s all. And she seemed intelligent.

It’s interesting that I can’t support how vain I was two years ago. I think i couldn’t be friend of me two years ago.


Why?

Two options: nature, everything okay; insecurities, everything not okay.

Picking a life partner is the third option. But is new and logical. It isn’t the real reason.

Nature or insecurities? Nature or insecurities?

Of course that I have some insecurities in this topic. However, the fact that I feel more secure when I do something doesn’t mean that I do that because I feel insecure.

Why do I relate with people?

Because it makes me happy indirectly by mutual help and talking about interesting things.

Why do I like to meet alejo/dylan/joe?

Because I like the conversations I had with them. I like the mutual empowering to work. I like to be with people who can support me and whom I can support.

Maybe I need them so bad because I don’t have my needings fulfiled yet.

Why did I feel so great when I could meet with Alejo? Because I was extremely alone.

Let’s say I meet with girls for insecurities and nature.

If it’s for insecurities, it will never end. I’ll be a jealous friend/boyfriend. If I meet girls because that would make me feel that I “know it all,” I’ll have extremely crappy relationships with extremely crappy people.

Okay. But I still feel insecure.

Why in the world am I insecure?

If you feel integer with what you’re doing, there’s no room for insecurities.

What torments you, santi?

Thinking that nobody likes me. Is that really?

To decide consciously about how you measure and what are your goals. Indeed, you build what you measure. Not to measure money or kisses, but to measure to improve yourself, to be calm, to he yourself. Kisses, sex, and all that stuff seem to be a byproduct of the things that really matter. Maybe you get more kisses if you measure them. But who wants kisses? You can get those easily. And focusing on them will make you being less focused on the things that matter: deep conversations, being useful to the other, connecting to them, looking them into the eyes, being integer and honest, being yourself. Those things are the ones worth measure. Yeah, maybe you don't get the kiss today if you behave in that way. But I think the love you'll obtain in the long term will be better.

Indeed, I got those kisses easily. And that wasn’t the way to behave. Remember when Clari told me, “let’s talk,” and I was too focused on kissing her and seeing the next steps and all that stuff.

I often think about how great it would be to know it all about “relationship with girls.”

There’s a completely rational thing to meet girls in a romantic way: to look for a life’s partner.

Watching a girl, for me, it’s like watching an impressive landscape. Looking her into the eyes feels excellent. But what about that feeling?

For sure, I had a unmet need in the past. When I was on porn, or when I was with the apps to talk with people to learn a language.

Connections, my dear. It’s all about that. A kiss can go without a connection. But as it’s a by-product of a connection, I think that I have to measure that. Wrong! hahaha. The kiss in itself represents nothing. Having sex in itself is nothing. But if you are in a relationship in which you are connected, the kisses will be a by-product that shows that you’re doing good. Remember the kiss with Zoe. As itself, it doesn’t represent a shit. It’s the connection the thing I want to maximize. We don’t need to look up for that kiss. If we do things right, it will happen.

Connecting isn’t easy, but it’s great. Although I can suffer in the work to achieve a connection, it feels great. To maximize kisses you need to feel secure and a “know it all” person. However, to achieve a connection, you need to open yourself, show your insecurities, show that you

In the best case, a “siento algo por vos” should be an explicitation of the connection. But really, it’d work well without even making that explicitation.

Now, the answer to “why do I meet girls?” is easy.

I like the connection with them. This is somewhat related to nature.

It’s easy to get kisses. You can go to a night-bar and get lots of them. But don’t let you get trapped by the fact that, physically, the kiss between two connected people is the same that one between two people in a night-bar.
What you feel from the first kiss? Something meaningful.

A kiss is worth nothing by itself. Why in the world should we measure something as worthless as a kiss? Why should I focused on my beautiness if my perception of it changes somewhat randomly and I can’t change it that much anyway?

Let’s measure the things that matter for once. It’s more about lifting up calmy something that it felt to her and less about nervously making a joke about the waiter. The former example could seem worthless. But it’s not. It’s what shows who I am. Deeply caring about Ro’s goal is another thing to do more. The way to showing off to a girl shouldn’t be to look confidently or that stuff. The way to show off should be being honest. If a girl doesn’t like that, probably she wasn’t a good option in the first place. It’s more about listening to the songs of Savoretti/Santiago Nahual Cossarini and less to Rombai/that cumbia.

This is not to say that the relationship should be something serious without playing nor having sex. In fact, with friends like Joe/Ale/Dylan, we had a lot of fun and I’m pretty sure we never looked for that. All that stuff is a by-product of the connection. By no means I would avoid those moments of playing.

Okay. You are talking about this concept callled “connecting with others.” What is it all about?

Solving some insecurities plays an interesting role here. If I’m insecure, I can’t open myself enough. If I’m insecure, I can’t say what I feel. By contrast, if I’m secure, I can say what I feel: “que más anti-sistema que decir lo que pensas?”

Connecting with others.
Now, I know what I’d like to maximize. It isn’t texting Delfi, asking her to go out, and trying hard to kiss her. But it is talking to her, caring about her, asking her to go out, and connecting with her.

Yeah, there are gonna be extremely beautiful people. But it’s like fat. Eating your veggies makes you feel more energetic. We live in a context called “humans,” and we should take advantage of it. We are hard-wired to look for fat and beautiful people. But eating fat or having sex with a beauty person (per se) gives us a high. And nothing else.

Connecting with others. Okay. It gets interesting when I ask you, “so if your goal is connecting with others, why do you want to do it specifically with girls?”

One answer could be that I’m bad with girls and good with boys so I get enough with boys and not enough with girls.

But not. It’s different.

Don’t get me wrong. I don’t mean that sex isn’t necessary. I mean that focusing on getting sex is unhealthy.

What’s special about connecting? Remember the letters from confirmación, kimlu, and balseiro. They are connections in its purest way. It’s saying what you really think. And yeah. I know that those letters represent what I’d like to do with my life. Remember touching other’s hands in Ítaca. Or all those looking into the eyes.

Is there something special about connecting with girls specifically? What I feel for Delfi Ballester isn’t something similar to what I feel for Delfi Rj. What I feel for Delfi Rj is something about her as a person. When I think about her, I imagine us talking. Yeahhh. I think there’s something different with girls. I feel so. But I don’t know what.

Do machines connect between them?
If not, it makes sense that a connection could be different between the same sex and between different sexes.

I think this is hour to leave.

Now I know what I like, I know my goal. I like to connect with people. To be in calm, look into his/her eyes and feel great. To have those deep conversations. To say, I like/love you. Indeed, it’s not about sex, a kiss, or a high. It’s about connecitng.

I don’t know if makes sense to continue going down. Why do I want to play football/to code?

Connecting with people is inherently human. It makes us happy in the long-term. And that’s what I’m looking for. A kiss per se doesn’t makes me happy in the long-term. However, a kiss can represent hours of understanding the other. More relatioships like the one with Clari, and less like the one with Zoe. Just check our Whatsapp’s chats and you can tell.

I see myself more beauty in some random moments, and that maybe is linked with my happiness. This can also apply to how I see the other girl. If I connect with them, my perception of beauty will make his work.

What were two of the moments where you connected the most?
Talking about our life’s goal with Julia in Kimlu’s forest.
Playing with the cards with Clari in the reencuentro Bayer.

Maybe those moments enabled the relationship with Julia/Clari. Indeed, those moments built the relationship.

Let’s get things clears, again. It isn’t that I shouldn’t enjoy a kiss/sex. It is that I shouldn’t measure myself by that.

The TL;DR is:
I shouldn’t put the goal of kissing a girl. That would maximize shitty things like looking confident, being a fake alpha male, being jealous.
My goal should be connecting with people. That would maximize interesting values such as deep conversations, being useful to others, being integer, being myself, looking into her eyes, and being honest. Sex, kisses, and all that stuff would come off. And I can assure you they will feel x3 better than coming from the fake alpha male. And I’m not talking necessarily about the long-term.







---------------
Life’s goal: connecting with people, between others.

Btw, distractions are a big big deal. I had two recurring bad habits about loneliness and distractions, often not caring enough about them.
The power of asking the right questions

Does it influence my connection with a person if she is deeply connecting with other? Maybe, in the long-term, a good connection is given by a lot of time. And you can achieve that with only one person. Two means halving the time.

The difficulty of building a brain can lie in a computational level and not in what we know about the brain. Indeed, a computer with enough processing power can solve any problem using brute force. Also, forty years ago, neural nets were shelved because they required more processing power that the available at that time.

Moreover, without computers, AI would be unthinkable. So, are there any technologies that can enable a new version of AI? (as actual computers enable the actual version of AI)

Quantum computers can be an option. What about a massively parallel computer?

Parallel computing appeared as an opportunity for processors when in 2004 frequency scaling didn’t work any more. Moreover, some years ago, chip companies arrived at a possible physics limit. State-of-the-art transistors are 10nm wide (considering that each atom is from 0.1 to 0.5 nm, that transistor is 50 atom wide approx.)

Taking that into account, it would be useful to have some alternatives. A parallel computer is useful if we can divide a task into several independent suproblems. The problem arises when there is a portion of the problem that can’t be parallelizable. If we have a program that takes 20 hours in a single CPU, from which 1 hour isn’t parallelizable, then our maximum speed-up is 20 (no matter how many processors we use.)

Let’s consider each neuron as a CPU.

The brain is a massively parallel machine. Now, the supercomputer with most cores has around 20 million and it uses 20 MW. If we compare the raw numbers, we are far away from building something similar to a brain. It has 100 billion neurons and the system as a whole consumes 20 W.

The latency between two neurons can vary between 0.5 ms and 10 ms.

Pinging my router gives me a latency between 0.7 ms and 4 ms (using a cabled connection).
Pinging Google (8.8.8.8) takes between 8 ms and 13 ms.

Also, there are approx. 2 billion smartphones and another 2 billion computers in the world. In total, there are between 10 billion and 30 billion devices connected to the Internet. That isn’t that far from the 100 billion neurons.

We should consider that not all those neurons are used for interesting things such as critical thought. For instance, some neurons have to be used to control how we walk or talk. A gorilla has 42 billion neurons and doesn’t do any interesting thing.

So, what would happen if we use all the connected devices to simulate a brain? Would it work?
I don’t know. Let’s say it doesn’t work. In principle, it wouldn’t be a problem of latency nor a problem of amount of devices. It could be a problem of our lack of understanding of the brain.

Society of mind
There are three different time scales
Evolution
Learning during life
Ideas developed in the last twenty centuries. This field isn’t that explored.

Physics has a dozen of theories that explain everything. In contrast, psychology could have more than a hundred. But those hundred theories are additional rules, not other rules, to those of physics.

When the human knows intuitively how to do something, she discards what she knows as “common sense.”

It isn’t that the mind has something special. It’s just a collection of neurons working.

“In general, we're least dwdre of what our minds do best.”

If we model each complex action as a set of concepts in the model I’m building, then the part that’s most difficult for the brain is the frontier in those connected concepts. Executing those concepts is easily: we recognize characters, then words, and then concepts in milliseconds.

Each task is divided in subtasks. Each task can be compromised with other task. That is, both want to be the actual action but can’t happen at the same time.

The weaker the subordinates are, the less competent the superiors are. If subordinates are competing, they make their superior weaker.

Pain and pleasure distract us from our long-term goals, focusing us on minimizing pain / maximizing pleasure in the short-term. If solving the pain requires a long-term solution, we have a tough problem.

Two ways to see ourselves:
single view: I think
multiple view: one part wants to play soccer; the other part wants to study. This view can be related to the mammal mind confronting with the human mind. However, maybe we don’t need the mammal mind in an artificial intelligence.

A mind can be as an artwork. The beauty isn’t in any specific place per se.

To understand how something works, one has to know its purposes. Why does this want to do that? Our goals produce our behavior.

We can’t directly switch on/off anger or hunger. Evolutionarily speaking, it would be terrible. So, there are tricks to do what we want. But they are indirect. We can’t change for one day to the other, for we can make mistakes. It’s better to have an average of our mindsets.

In part, self-discipline is making our emotional/mammal brain biases point towards our goals.

We have ideals that define how much we care about our goals. These ideals should be reasonably stable. It can work as a long-term memory through generations.

Reality isn’t always a “A => B.” Usually, it’s “A => B & B => A.” That’s more difficult to understand.

Circular questions: “What’s the purpose of life?” It never ends because to every answer we can ask “What’s the purpose of [answer]” (For instance, “what’s the purpose of following your interests?”) “Just because” isn’t a valid answer!

Let’s say “we” are composed of ten things, and each of these ten things is composed of another ten things, and so on to neurons. What’s the immediately next things after brain? An answer could be systems: seeing, touching, smelling, and so on. But they are related: a smell can evoke a picture (seeing)

We learn by analogy. But the first times you can’t learn by analogy: you don’t know anything! So, can we enable the learning that isn’t by analogy in our adulthood?

The human evolve to get the practical knowledge of things, not for philosophy or science. When we think of a glass, we only think that’s something to drink. Knowledge is useful only when we can exploit it to help us reach our goals.

Understanding our consciousness has the problem that we must use our mind to understand our mind. So, as we are using it, we are modifying our consciousness. When we are evaluating some options, we can carry out little experiments (in our mind, or in reality) to recollect information.

We can have multiple layers of the brain, the first one connected to the reality, the second one connected to the first one, and so on. In this way, we can achieve a high-level management in the higher layers.

The time doesn’t occur linearly in the brain. We can have certain “peajes” that slow the process.

When learning a concept, we do a lot more than memorizing. Memorizing is connecting the concept with only one other concept. Learning is making a network of concepts. So, if one road fails, we can follow others.

If inquiry is suppressed, then one would think that there are no questions unanswered. The problem is, there were no questions at all! If something seems to be very powerful, maybe we didn’t ask enough.

Different parts of the brain use different languages; they can’t communicate among themselves. If I have a system that does a specific set of actions, and another that does another set of unrelated actions, they can communicate among themselves. This happens because there are no conceivable translation of the actions; they live in a different world.

Boringness and curiosity seem a good motivator for exploration. They can worth studying.

Consciousness arrives when our brain detects some failure. Both pain and confusion are signals of change: we don’t want to continue what we were doing.

Common sense is a big deal. It isn’t something trivial. Common sense is composed by a lot of different task, each one with its own representation. When we have one representation and some training, executing new cases is easy. First law case is far more difficult than the hundredth one.

Maybe we can add to the GAN system a way to share a goal, so they work together a way to communicate. The test system can give feedback in how to improve to the generator system.

Maybe reinforcing only the good actions isn’t the best option. Solving hard problems consists of exploring bad actions. Something like novelty is interesting in this case. Maybe we should apply the concept of novelty in RL.

k-lines: when we have an idea, we connect to a single neuron all the neurons that were turned on. Later, when we want to remember something, we turn on that single neuron. Instead of creating a single neuron for each memory, we can connect create a k-line (neuron) by connecting it to older k-lines (neurons.) This is more economical.

When two or more parts of the same division are activated, we have troubles. In contrast, when two or more agents of different divisions are activated, everything is okay (e.g., a small white ball)

Model: a kite can be strongly connected to string but lowly to red and white. If they are conflicts in the connections with red, they are easily suppressed.

Generally, we only want some details, clearly not in the atomic level.

The brain usually puts together two agencies if they process something related (e.g., how large is an object.) This should be recreated in an AI.

Usually, it’s not useful to use a new agency because it can fail. However, we can append it to the agent’s brain and simulate how good is it working.

“a diagram can only illustrate a principle: there cannot be any compact way to represent all the details of full-grown mind-society”

sensations on their own are nothing. Instead, we can describe sensations relative to others.

“touching nearby spots of skin will usually give rise to similar sensations: this is because the corresponding nerves run in parallel courses and thus cause similar activities inside the brain”

What does the brain do with contradictorial information? Maybe that’s the reason of childhood amnesia.
The first step in developing a brain that senses could be recognizing external places (ie, a set of sensors.) After that, the brain can create complex relationships between those places.

“children seem to recapitulate the history of astronomy: first they imagine the world as centered around themselves-and only later do they start to view themselves as moving within a stationary universe,”

Predestined learning: although we learn several things during life, we are predestined to learn them. Evolution provides the foundations to later on learn.

“we know that when a major brain area is damaged in a young person, the mirror region can sometimes take over its function.”

The mirror regions allow comparisons of different versions. This is similar to Double Q Learning.

There are different types of learning:
Uniframing: combining several descriptions into one
Tolerate, prevent, enforce: the three ways of describing a policy. (tolerance=indifference)
The brain can store different memories as the diff between the memory we want to store and a main memory.
Accumulating: combining incompatible descriptions into one entity. They aren’t the same, but this is useful to make connections.
When several descriptions don’t fit into one, the brain uses accumulating. But this is pricey, so when the brain has a lot of accumulated descriptions, it starts to uniframe them.
This is related to the view that first we learn each case as a different point of view. And as time passes, we relate them and uniframe them.
Reformulating: changing one description
Transframing: connecting two concepts.

To recognize things, the brain connects functions and descriptions. And it’s not only at a high level (e.g., chair => sit.) Instead, the brain makes connections such as chair back is to support sitter’s back.

“Many good ideas are really two ideas in one-which form a bridge between two realms of thought or different points of view”

Exceptions: brain’s generalizations tolerate some exceptions in its models. The brain doesn’t need to fit everything.

Animals tend to develop sensors that detect stimuli that can be affected by their actions. As we grow up, we want to predict what our actions change.

To define some terms such as chair or game, it’s not enough to talk about the physical traits. We need to use psychological terms such as our goals.

Definitions are connections between our agencies, so they aren’t a sharp definition of the things. When we talk or exemplify, we are giving hints of that definition.
Seeing and believing
Creativity: new ways to look at things

We always see things as partially different, so there is an arbitrary boundary that makes us say that two things are the same even though they are partially different.

Do we know how 1-year-old babies see/think? It would be interesting to know that.

“An expert is one who does not have to think. He knows” This is related to the power of intuiton in people who are very knowledgable.

When we learn, we take a lot of time to perform the first action. But as we practice, we simplify the process, maybe storing only the low-level actions without the high-level processes.

Body-support: the body is the primary goal. The support are the other features that make the body possible.

“To understand how something works, it helps to know how it can fail.” When we remove an object and a part of the system fails, now we can know the function of that object.

“We often self-impose assumptions that make our problems more difficult.” That’s why it’s good to take nothing for granted if we are thinking about ideas.

Our perception is influenced both by our expectations and sensations (reality)

When we are stuck, seeking novelty wins the day.

One thing that makes us not solving all problems is that there are strange problems, and if we overfit to them, we lose our precious generalization that solves a lot of problems. So if we aim to solve all problems, we can end solving less problems whatsoever.

If evolution is so short-sighted, how did it develop things like humans?

Old ideas are dangerous because we already patched them for exceptions and mastered them. A new idea that we didn’t grasp yet, however potentially powerful, can’t fairly compete with the olds. In the short term, usually the old idea would win. If two ideas one old and one new seem equally powerful, it makes sense to err on the side of the new idea. The unconfidence when starting a new project or idea is related to this. An AI should praise novelty.

There are two strategies to achieving a goal: discerning the requirements between the goal and the actual situation, and working in those requirements. Or sometimes, when we think we lose everything, it makes sense to imagine the worst situation and seeing the difference between our actual situation. In general, we are comparing our situation with the two ends of the spectrum: the goal and the antigoal.

Interaction: when two or more agencies achieve a state that neither can do on its own. (e.g., horizontal and vertical movement going in diagonal.) It makes sense to make something like a table of what happens if we mix together two or more actions. (we should also consider that each action can be activated by a certain degree.)

CONSCIOUSNESS AND MEMORY
Consciousness is the simple act of agents that receive as input the state of other agents.

As the short-term memory is limited, we can’t carry out the details of great ideas, because the great ideas use most of the slots of the short-term memory. That’s why we don’t know how they were formed. Also, this is why some ideas are a synchronous chain of thoughts, because old thoughts disappear to leave usable space.

There are some memories in which we see ourselves as a third person. These memories probably are reconstructed ones. They can be “memories of memories.” I think that if we remember a memory many times, the memory converts in the “memory of the memory,” making the memory in a third-person view with the perceptions from our older-views. This is why lying is problematic.

As I write earlier, the brain has to remove some memories to make sense of the world. Maybe that memory (or agency) helps in reaching objects when we can’t walk.  It doesn’t make sense to store a memory when we couldn’t walk, for it’s not useful at all. So if we feel that we are losing our memory, that could mean we are learning and removing our past conceptions.

Memory: sensations + perceptions. It can reactivate our brain in similar ways that it was activated in the past.

“There is evidence that long-term memories can never form at all unless their short-term antecedents are permitted to persist for certain intervals.”

As humans, we act in a high level called language. What’s something higher than language?

“The child who is asked to "take turns / share toys" might fear that by the time its turn arrives, it may not want the object anymore”

“The Recursion Principle; When a problem splits into smaller parts, then unless one cdn apply the mind's full power to each subiob, one's intellect will get dispersed and leave less cleverness for each new task”

“In any case, our culture wrongly teaches us that thoughts and feelings lie in almost separate worlds” emotions are a resource used by our agencies to fulfill their goals. This isn’t irrational.

“unlike all other animals, we humans make for ourselves most of the problems we face” => Nothing is a problem on its own. It’s only our perception of them.

“the swarms of social ants and bees are really multibodied individuals whose different organs move around freely” Do ants learn from errors committed by another ant?

Cross-exclusion: when we start to do an activity, it inhibits its competitors. For instance, if we want to eat and to drink, if we go to eat, we inhibit our need to drink. This is in part why it’s useful to start doing an activity even though we don’t have enough motivation: doing something will provide the motivation.
What prevents us from starting to do lots of things at once?
Conservatism: we provide a fixed amount of resources
Negative feedback: the more energy the system requires, the more we inhibit it.

The brain has different levels for the vision (from the pixels’ to the goals’ layer.) If it wants to allucinate something, it’s enough with arousing the higher layers.

Theory for babies’ brain: they start with separated agencies.

Babies are so emotional because they life depended on how they expressed. If they had shown mixed feelings, it would have been difficult to notice what they wanted.

Infant: her emotions clearly mean something. (e.g., she cries => she wants to eat.) However, when we grow up, we use our emotions to our advantage, trying to impose in us the ideas from the people that surrounds us.

Development
Learning could happen in layers. We use an inner layer to learn the outer layer. We only activate the outer layer when it passes the tests. One way to see this is that the new layer is a new version of the old layer. Another way is that the outer layer bases in the inner layer to do higher-level actions.

How a baby develops values and goals? It takes generations and lots of people to create a civilized community. We can’t do it during our life. We base our values in our parents. (this could have been done by natural selection.) First we learn to recognize our parents, then we learn their ends.

Whatever one’s goal, he often ends seeking knowledge and trying to understand how things work. In the road of trying to accomplish a low-level goal, he will face several tasks. For the cross-exclusion principle, we inhibit the other tasks. Thus, we are interested in learning how to improve in this task. And we are short-sighted, so if we saw that this task helped in accomplishing a goal, we have labeled it as good. This produces a chain reaction of working.

Check piaget’s work.

Investment principle: doing something makes us continue doing it because we are receiving feedback and thus getting better at it. This could explain why there are people that are extremely good at what they do (e.g., Messi) while most of us are pretty average.

Exception principle: if an agency A becomes too good at doing something, several other agencies will depend on it. The agency A will become a fat monster who has to satisfy everyone and thus can’t change that much.

Something that isn’t present in the AI field is parenting and learning in societies.

In contrast to learning skills, we acquire our goals by signals of love and rejection of our parents. This is a way to organize our initially separated brain-agencies. When one parent is dissimilar from the other, one tend to remove one to simplify the learning process and be less confused.


Attachment is created quickly but fades out slowly. (we take a lot of time to stop feeling love for a person.)

As there are fears runned by emotions, we can fear about intellectual situations. When a child has a flawed reasoning, such as one is near two and n is near n+1 => one is near infinite, he could detect that the result is wrong but he sees no problem in his reasoning. This could lead to unconfidence and make the child say, “I can’t do this.” We usually treat the lack of information in a problem as if something were wrong either with the person who write the problem or with how we processed the problem.

As we attached emotionally, we are attached intellectually. We learned the opinions and styles of our heroes. Those images constraint how we have to think. There isn’t such thing as a “purely rational” being. In our work, there are decisions that we approach with how we are.

Reasoning
“Logic no more explains how we think than grammar explains how we speak; both can tell us whether our sentences are properly formed, but they cannot tell us which sentences to make”

Generate-test method: we don’t need a complex system to solve a problem. If we have a generator of solutions (it could be random) and a tester, we could combine both.

Logic is different from common sense. In logic, there is a link between two concepts or there isn’t. In common sense, we can add evidence to a link and the argument can become partially better. In common sense, we also see how much an argument matches with reality.

Logic serves to clean an argument and test whether it’s right or not.

There should be something like logic but with uncertainty. Is that related to bayes theorem?

If we prove the same thing in several ways, that is, if we connect several arguments in parallel to a final conclusion, we make our reasoning stronger. Similarly, if we connect several arguments in a serial connection, we make our reasoning weaker. (the chain is as strong as the weakest link.)

We often don’t need to know the best thing to do in a given moment. We need to know which is the best option of a given set of alternatives.

It’s impossible to be completely understood because the speaker isn’t identical to the listener. Our minds isn’t like logic: to know the meaning of two, we have a network of concepts. This could be better, for if one concept fails, we have others as a backup.

Scientists build math as thin as possible. That is, they try to make their logic all in a serial connection, so if one thing fails, everything collapses. This helps scientists to quickly notice if something is wrong. However, when people teach math, they shouldn’t do it in the way math is built. Humans learn by a network of concepts. So if a learner didn’t grasp something, she can use it another concept from the network.

How the brain is so robust?
Redundancy: having multiple copies of the same agencies.
Distributed: having agencies spread out in the brain.
Accumulation: having several agencies to fulfill the same goal.

The feature of accumulation is interesting. It’s function is to have available different ways of accomplishing the same action. If something fails or turns out to be bad, we can use other agency. As we grow, I think that a set of a few agencies dominates the others in the low-level. For instance, I don’t have many ways to write in a keyboard (low-level action.) However, I do have different choices in how I decide to write (high-level action.)

Words and ideas
[check Samuel Jonhnson’s life]
Why do words stop to have meaning when we repeat it several times?

It’s interesting that our conscious brain uses words as a way of thinking. Clearly the unconscious brain doesn’t use them. Is the conscious brain really using words? Can we devise something with a higher level than words and use it to think? In what “language” do animals think?

We can represent things as a set of properties. We look for properties that don’t change usually and that are independent from one another. If the properties are continuous, and we have an object that doesn’t fit in one of the properties, we can imagine increasing the value of one property. For instance, shape, color, and size are common, independent properties. Shape is somewhat discrete (non-continuous.) If we imagine an apple, we arouse several separated agencies. It’s interesting that arousing one agency can arouse another. Thence, with partial information we can produce a chain reaction that gives us a lot of information. (This is called reminding.)

To produce a high-level agency that’s useful, we don’t have to put together two random low-level actions. Instead, putting together two useful agencies will probably give something interesting. (this is similar to the interesting things that happen in the intersection between two different fields.)

Context and ambiguity
It isn’t only that words are difficult to express: thoughts are also ambiguous. When we think about them, we change. We can’t get the state of several low-level agencies because we can’t communicate with them. Also, each agency is acting in different times.

Each word is ambiguous on its own. It’s when we put a lot of them together that we can refer to one action in the spectrum of things we can be referring to. Thus, as it’s useful to use specific words, it’s helpful to use words that have completely different meanings than the ones we already said. If we say PC and notebook, we aren’t conveying that much information.

Our low-level agencies react quicker but we put less confidence on them. So we can make an initial impression about somebody and then override it with high-level agencies. Acting slow has it benefits. If we are acting too quickly, it could mean we are giving up to superficial meanings.

Understanding is a process of some steps that reinforce the meaning. As we understand something, and recognize it, we suppress the competition for other meanings. (this is related to the disadvantages of being too confident in something we don’t know: we end up assuming we know something and it’s wrong.)

What we think doesn’t depend that much in our sensors. Instead, we think taking into account the context and previous thoughts.

TRANSFrames
A low-level agency can use the state of another low-level agency. So high-level agencies don’t need to convey information to their children. I think this starts to happen when we are so good at something that we don’t need regulation from high-level agencies. Thus, the process is started by some polyneme (a set of sensors with a meaning) and excites a low-level agency. Then that agency excited another low-level agency and so on.

Pronomes: placeholders to store the information we should focus on in the next actions. (it’s like a dictionary. e.g., origin: boston. destination: new york.) We can’t multitask, so I think we can’t store more than one thing at a time.

Kids easily forget. They don’t control good enough their memories. Any interruption will erase their memory. Older kids remember more. Having a better control of memory allows comparisons and predictions.

EXPRESSION
Polynemes: permanent k-lines. Long term memories. They apply different ideas to different things. (an apple has color red, and medium size.)
Pronomes: temporal k-lines. Short term memories.
Isonomes: each process has something similar. The isonomes take advantage of this. They apply the same idea to many different things at once.

It takes approx. half an hour without serious disturbances to form a long-term memory. If we want to learn something, we should have long sessions without interruptions. Some evidence suggests that we can be forming several long-term memories at once.

If we think in terms of pronomes (i.e., placeholders) we can de-specialize an action. We first learn using specific polynemes, and then replace them with pronomes.

We should limit with what we feed our isonomes. That is, we can’t generalize to “put the ocean on the bucket.”

Treating our thoughts as things helps us in using our learned knowledge to deal with things.

“Without that ability to reflect [that of contemplating the products of our thoughts], we would have no general intelligence-however large our repertoire of special-purpose skills might grow”

IMP: As humans we are continually trying to understand the causes of the events because that will help us in predicting future events (both in the world and our minds.) Also, this leads us to find causes that aren’t really there such as false gods and superstitions. We are a machine that looks for patterns.

If the listener know what to expect, it’s easier to communicate.

Communication: Ana wants to communicate some structure P to Beto. Ana begins to create an structure Q in her mind and Beto’s mind. For each difference between P and Q, she uses a mental process to change Q in his mind and an expression (equivalent to the mental process) to change Q in Beto’s mind.

Making an efficient differential between two things seems as an important task and one that humans do often.

When we communicate something, we are oversimplifying our state of mind. That helps us in making better formulations.

Comparisons
A lot of things can be represented by differences. Let’s say we are in state A and know that with procedure P we arrive to Z. Let’s call D the differences between A and Z. Later on, if we observe differences D we can infer that P was the cause.

We make differences of higher orders. We make differences of differences. (e.g., height of an object is difference between top and bottom.) We can reuse an agency multiple times for higher orders. That is, we can feed an agency with its own output and it can produce useful results.

If the brain want to compare things, it should compare the outputs of nearly identical agents. Otherwise, nothing useful will come out (a possible cause is that each agency has its own language.)

Brain’s sensors are in part change detectors. If a sensor’s input doesn’t change, the brain doesn’t care about it. Thus, a way to detect differences between states is to store memories P and Q, input P to an agency, and then input Q to the same agency. This doesn’t allow the brain to make comparisons between more than two objects. Maybe humans share the same limitations.

Why is it impossible to become native in a foreign language when one is an adult? It can be because we are genetically programmed to avoid learning from a certain age on. Some thousand years ago, this could have prevented humans from adapting to the language of its kids and thus not teaching them the developed language.

Frames
Generally, our sight comes together with memories. If we listen “it’s raining frogs,” a lot of different thoughts appear in our mind.

Frame’s terminals: blanks for each characteristic of a frame.

When we identify a person, dog, or other thing, and we don’t have the value for some terminal, we assume the default value.

“Each reader reads only what is already inside himself. A book is only a sort of optical instrument which the writer offers to let the reader discover in himself what he would not have found without the aid of the book”

Default assumptions are a big deal. The brain never sees the world complete. It’s always erring on the side of default assumptions - that seems to be a process of our unconscious mind.


Random stuff
Talk about quantum computing
Check largest neural network
check how much does it take to do an arithmetic computation.

the confidence in the young people is something interesting. We don’t follow our gut because we didn’t yet see our intuition become reality. We simply didn’t live that much. It can happen that when we start to believe in ourselves, we don’t have good ideas anymore.

Continuing with Frames
Read about the unconscious.

Recognizer: the opposite of a k-line. It should be able to recognize the presence/absence of objects and relationships between those objects.

Frame-arrays
In a section of a picture we can’t see two things at the same time. If we have an optical illusion, we either see the picture in one way or the other. Thus, it should exist some “locking-in” property in our mind.

As we move, something will change in our internal representation of the world if it doesn’t change its form. For instance, if we move past a circular dish, we will expect it to have an ellipse form. If our sight change in that way, we will regard it as normal.

There are certain triggers for the frames. Some can be direction-nemes: we see a section of a room, and we remember that on the right there is another image. Other can be polynemes: we see a door and we remember the frame for the room inside that door. The latter trigger is generally used in places we are familiar with or that seem strange.

Persistence
The concept that every great thing takes a lot of work is powerful. Working for that thing isn’t easy. It’s all about infinite average wednesdays.

What I do want (curiosity)
If we want to optimize something, first we should have clear what’s that something. My goal is: going all the way with what I love. But what does it mean? There are a set of things that interest me. There are some topics: the brain, being with people, playing football. And there are some methods: programming, thinking, reading, writing. I love questions, I love understanding. With regards to going all the way, it’s simple: being persistent in spending a lot of effort. Beauty seems to be an interesting way to discover your interests.

[I need a connection between my goals and what activities I can do]

What I don’t want (productivity)
Generally, when we aren’t confident of ourselves, seeking prestige, being competitive, or rejected, we don’t follow our curiosity. That isn’t that important because we’re looking for validation. The first step, I think, is to accept that we’re satisfied with our version of ourselves. We have to accept the reality and accept that there are always problems. This is how the world is, and now I’m going to build upon it. If we’ve been looking for validation for a lot of time in the past, changing to following our curiosity will take time. (check “persistence” section)

Discerning between both
A good filter: when I’m doing a given activity, do I forget about the clock or do I even look the clock and desire to pass slow?
People: looking into the eyes, talking 6 hours with people.
The same activity can be driven by curiosity at first and by productivity later, or vice versa: working on AI.

Crisis
For the past year and a half, I suffered from something I called “crisis.” You can think it as something near a depression, but not that bad. It was terrible because I felt bad for a lot of time, but I wasn’t getting the solution to the problem. I didn’t understand it, and believe me that I tried hard. At some point I noticed something interesting, I never felt this “crisis” in the mornings. Later on I noticed something else: if I worked on useless, boring stuff or alone, I felt the “crisis.”

Eureka! The solution arrived. I was forcing myself to work when I just couldn’t. I think I’m very disciplined, so that makes me push myself to work if that’s what I want to. But it turned out there are days or specific times when it’s way more difficult to get myself to work. Interestingly, I discovered that I work better with people and in the mornings. And as everybody, I can work more if it’s on useful. interesting stuff.

I’m not sure if I can’t work at specific times of the day. All what I know is that forcing myself to work made me helpless and sad for more than a year. Thus, I’m finding alternative methods to make myself work.

One great thing is to have available different tasks about different topics to do. That’s useful because sometimes it isn’t that I don’t want to work. What happens is that I don’t want to work in the specific thing I worked in the last couple of hours. So all what I need is a change of activity. Also, this helps in changing between difficult and easy activities depending on my energies.

Breaks are also useful to recharge energies. The things that work for me are walking, exercising, talking to people, playing some instrument, drawing, eating, meditating. The ultimate thing here is to do something that allows you to relax and wonder a little bit. During these breaks, I think it’s important to not think too much about the last activity, but forcing that doesn’t seem good. For instance, if you exercise, talk with people, or meditate, probably you aren’t going to continue thinking in the last activity.

After all, the bad thing isn’t that we sometimes can’t get ourselves work. The bad thing is that we can’t accept we sometimes can’t work because we end doing fake work instead of changing to other type of real work.

This is the mindset that make us work in fake stuff: I’m trying to work on interesting stuff, but I have no energy. So as I can’t accept I’m not having the same productivity, I change to other activity, one that reads “I will give you the same productivity that the other hard activity, but spending half the energy.” You can see why this will be wrong.

In the book The obstacle is the way I learned something important: every problem can be converted into an opportunity. When we can’t work, we shouldn’t be anger at ourselves. We can take advantage of this situation and spend time in ourselves. Yesterday, when I couldn’t work, I started to read So good they can’t ignore you. It turned out to be that I was doing a lot of things wrong with my life. Discovering that was great. Also, if we can’t work, we can spend some time enjoying life: walking or connecting with people.

Life is what you make of it
If we have interesting things to work on, life will seem interesting. Otherwise, we will feel that it’s boring. It’s the same with books: how can we do to read more books? Having interesting books available. [WIP]

How many hours does a life have?
Let’s say we live for 80 years and say we are 20 years old. That gives us 60 years, 22000 days, or 350000 awaken hours. A year has 6000 awaken hours.

Being confident enough
Two years ago, I started four different projects. When the first wasn’t working, I started another. And so on. Some months ago, I noticed something interesting: I started several MOOCs and books, but I always stop doing them at 30%. And I think something similar happened to me in relationships with people and other stuff.

In retrospective, I think that the problem wasn’t that the projects weren’t working or that the books weren’t worth it. The problem was that I gave up too early. This can happen for two things: don’t being confident enough and [other thing]

Don’t being confident enough is a big deal. If you want to do new things for the world, you aren’t going to have a handbook on how to do it. As the song Renegades says, “Lonely the pioneer is.” [WIP: How can we do this]

Stick to the plan!

Flow
Sometimes the problem is getting started or not having the habit of working. We all know that it’s way more difficult to get started than continue working when you started. Sometimes it pays to start when we aren’t completely sure of how we are going to sort the next obstacles.

Doing great stuff takes years, so the important thing here isn’t to find some magic passion beneath ourselves. The important thing is to have deliberate practice every day.


http://www.paulgraham.com/before.html
Make something people want.
You can only learn how to work in a startup by doing it.
It’s worth it to explore when you are young (>20).
Launching a startup is really tough. It’s not similar to a job.
It isn’t good to think consciously on startup ideas. That would give me bad, plausible-sounding ideas.
Instead:

Don’t think in the return/outcome. Just think how interesting is something. Be self-indulgent in this respect. Follow your interests/curiosities.
“Live in the future:” be in the leading edge of some field.
Don’t focus on “entrepreneurship.” Follow my intellectual inclinations/genuine curiosity.
Just learn.

http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html
Make something people urgently need.
If I have a startup idea, ask myself: do people need this so much that they would accept a crappy v1?
Live in the future and build what seems interesting
I should notice the opportunities, not “think up” ideas.
Be pragmatic about the idea. Don’t just think “this idea would be interesting,” think “it’s interesting. Let’s build a prototype now.”
Don’t use the filter “could this be a big company?”
IMP: don’t take anything for granted. Question everything. Why, why, why. Don’t care about the importance/outcome of those questions.
Pay attention to the annoying things.
Make a journal with the gap and anomalies of the day.
The clash of domains is a great source of ideas.
Build things
Beware of researching. It’s too specific.
Don’t care too much of competitors.
For a startup, it pays to do unsexy things (cause there are a lot more of opportunities and less competitors)
Ask to people “what they think it’s missing in the world?” “What annoys them?” “What would they like to do that they can’t.”
Have the time to build things just because they are interesting.

Trend
Electricity is applied to lots of stuff for improvement. For instance, it’s applied in cars, refrigerators, and lights.
Computation is applied to lots of stuff
Internet is applied to lots of stuff
AI is applied to lots of stuff

Sometimes, the process starts from scratch or some previous step. So, for instance, we have
electricity -> computers -> internet
then, electricity -> computers -> AI
then, electricity -> quantum computers
(or maybe), quantum computers
It seems like a DFS looking towards singularity

Personalization and interactivity layer over the Internet
Features
Provide an always-up-to-date version of the internet. For instance, translate US Dollars from 1930 to the value of today
What the Internet is left is the possibility of not getting distracted.
Quizzes like coursera
Highlighting like medium
Disable the option of websites to know if the mouse went out (prepscholar feature)
Alert the credibility of a comment in a given forum. In general, for instance, apply reddit’s algorithm to every blog.

Observations
The layer can apply to other kinds of content, such as books or lectures (yeah, audio.)
Good question to ask: what doesn’t the internet have yet?

Blackboard roll-up, so a projector can be used on it as well as markers.

Without Solution: an easier way of manipulating equations and drawings in the computer

Web Extension: SU + Memory Trainer

How to travel to the past? Find a particle in the space that is reflective. Look at it from the earth. If we focus correctly, we should see the earth, but some time ago.

Web Extension: Freeze the status of the social networks, like Whatsapp or Facebook and only defreeze them when we want. We can use them freezed.

Cars: most of the time, the cars remain parked. Why should this be in that way? What about renting cars? Just as people rent houses, they also can rent cars.

WIP: Create a personalization layer over the Internet. Extensions do that, but we can add it several improvements, such as replacing e.g., for for instance, IMO for in my opinion, and other stuff. This is related to the idea below. Other case: applying grammarly to the internet

Mobile browser that removes all the suggestions to download the app

Without solution: the Internet lacks interactivity. For instance, if I want to make a gym in my home, I have a great deal of information on the Internet, but the net doesn’t offer a way to correct me when I wrongly exercise. It can offer reliable feedback of the user’s actions.

Search engine: save the context. for example, if i’m searching about universities and I search about “rice,” the search engine should show me results about rice university

Without solution: how to continue 3d printings without having to throw it away?

Without solution: How to prevent correlation doesn't mean causation? e.g., some students go biking and others go in bus. Let's say students that go biking are more intelligent. How can we assure that those students, as they are more intelligent, decide to bike because it sounds better?

I search quite often queries like “slow or slowly”, “fast vs quickly”, or “dot after or before the quote”. It would be great if Google told me the answer in a big, font-size-48 word.

In the restaurant, the prices are static and the changes are done by hand and they take lots of time. If the prices are computadorized and shown in an iPad or something like that, prices could vary with an algorithm of machine learning. And during a day, the algorithm can learn a lot. With this price variation the revenue can be optimized.

Assistant to read books. You inputted a book to the system and it highlights the most important things for you, it shows you notes from others, it asks you a week later some questions to not forget the content of the book, it recommends other books

We do know that images contain more information (more bits) than text. So, what about having books with images? I don't mean videos; I mean images transmitting concepts. It doesn't need to be some image from the reality; instead abstract images.

People do nothing on the bus. It is a good market to exploit. Also it seems like a good place to meet new people (lots of people take the underground) A possible use is to make the bus a place to meet new people. So, the people download the app and if someone with the interest we are searching is near to us, a notification arrives

To avoid the reflex in the screen of the phone, we can set the intensity and color of some determinated pixels depending on the reflex (given by the camera)

IMP: Revolutionize videos with an editable-for-anyone format - YouTube + Wikipedia
Add to the videos the possibility to edit them and add content easily. So the people can fix the video error more often. In the new format, you can {add, remove, update}: {text, images, colors, sizes}.

The videos are really powerful, and with this tool, is easier to edit them. Also, it’ll be good if the people can create from scratch videos easily.

A possibility is make a page mixing YouTube and Wikipedia, so everyone can edit the content (like wikipedia) and everyone can upload videos, and the content is videos (like YouTube)

IMP: Improve the user experience in selecting options
Situation: whenever I go to restaurants, or I need to decide what phone buy, I get too many options to really consider each one. Therefore, my decision is based in incomplete information, and is easier to be biased by the restaurant’s or store’s owner.

Implementation: give the user the option to set that he wants (e.g. price range, cold or warm, pastas or meat). Then, only present to the user a few options.

Shuffle my knowledge - website discovery (scraping)
Situation 1: The web is big, and links like paulgraham.com are very useful, and sometimes it takes a long time to discover them.

Situation 2: Discover new topics, like a psychology or machine learning field

Improvement: Discover new topics and new pages of a topic

Similar products: StumbleUpon

TL;DR - make a brief of a page (scraping)
Situation 1: In the web are long articles with spam, repeated information and information we already know.

Situation 2: We need to read a long article in little time (e.g. in an exam).

Situation 3: We have a very long article and we want to know if it’s worth reading.

Improvement: Make a brief of a page, knowing what the user already knows, and what he likes. Allow the user to specify the time to spend reading or the content loss percentage, so if the user has one minute to read some article, the algorithm produces a brief with 45% content loss. Finally, the algorithm can follow some links and make some research about the topic to improve the quality of the brief.

Topic learning - scrap the web to make a course to learn a specific topic (scraping)
Situation 1: When we wanna learn a new topic, there are a lot of unordered information on the web.

Situation 1.1: We don’t know which are the firsts steps, and which is the correct path.

Situation 1.2: We already know about a topic, and we don’t want the firsts steps.

Situation 2: When we learn in YouTube, reading an article or a book, we don’t take advantage of retrieval learning (i.e. take quizzes a week after we learn the topic)

Improvement: Browse all available information about a topic and organize it to display it in an ordered manner. Take advantage of retrieval learning, making quizzes. At the beginning this can be done manually, and later can be automatized.
